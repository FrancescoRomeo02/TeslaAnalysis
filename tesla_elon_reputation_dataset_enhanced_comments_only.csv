comment,6dicr0,6dicr0,,"Here's a great response to Musk's 3 main objections to Hydrogen fuel cells by an Engineer, and yes the Engineer is director of the National Fuel Cell Research Center, located at UC Irvine. But again- it's not like Musk doesn't have a built in bias.

>Why the Automotive Future Will Be Dominated by Fuel Cells  
Range, adaptability, and refueling time will put hydrogen fuel cells ahead of the competition

>...Some strongly disagree with my position here. Most prominent among them, perhaps, is Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has deridingly referred to FCEVs as “fool-cell vehicles.”

>On one occasion in 2015, Musk gave three specific reasons for his position: concerns about the safety of hydrogen, the lack of fueling infrastructure for providing that hydrogen, and its nonrenewable nature. I suspect that Musk’s stance is colored by his desire to promote Tesla’s emerging line of BEVs, a bias that is a disservice to both the public and the environment.

>So let me explain why I think Musk’s remarks are off base. First, his statements about the dangers of hydrogen are overblown. All sources of vehicle energy—whether it’s hydrogen, gasoline, diesel fuel, natural gas, or the electricity stored in a battery—have safety issues associated with them.

comment,6erjqi,6erjqi,,"No, I don't. And quite frankly, I'm getting pretty tired of hearing that narrative.

First of all, let me say that I am pretty happy with my personal life. Me and my wife frequently go to the movies, hike the mountains, hang at the beach, visit museums and whatnot. I love to cook, play videogames, work out regularly, have many friends and occasionally get to drink copious amounts of beer. So although working at SpaceX can get rough from time to time, it's hardly fair to say that my life outside work sucks.

Nevertheless, working at SpaceX (and supposedly the same can be said for Tesla) can be extremely hard, challenging and stressful. Expectations are high, days are often long and I probably could get paid more elsewhere. So yeah, sure; I think it's fair to say that my job has affected my personal life quite a bit, and many of the horror stories you've heard are probably true, at least to some extent. But I truly detest the idea that Elon is some sort of slave-master, exploiting young souls under dangerous and unhealthy working conditions at sub-par wages, all so he can line his pockets with profits. That is just pure bullshit.

Naturally, working at SpaceX will not be for everyone.

> First, the company denies the meeting at which women described Tesla&#039;s factory as a &quot;Predator zone&quot; was a result of the essential oils invitation; the meeting, which was convened by a group called Women in Tesla, was already on the schedule.

The article for example talks about how the Bolt has 238 mile range to the Model 3's 215- yet, all Elon/Tesla has said is that's a minimum... Given that Bolt's range, I won't be at all surprised if the base model 3 ends up with closer to 250 mile range for the obvious reason of beating the Bolt... and that's before any battery pack upgrades. 

Beyond that, if you're in a lease or your car is getting older, perhaps looking a year and a half down the road to getting a 3 makes sense... It clearly has for the 400+K people who have put down deposits and maintained said position in line to get the car... Obviously there's an appetite for affordable electric cars with a decent range... Yes, eventually Ford, VW, etc will start making electric cars of their own with similar ranges, but, that's not for another 2-3 years minimum, and it'll take them even longer to actually start getting those into production and into dealerships, by which time Tesla should have caught up with it's initial demand and sorted out the initial kinks... with the addition of the potential for an additional car factory in the next couple years, and their model 'Y' crossover...",1587,True,1500380447.0,2017-07-18 14:20:47,14,0,inoeth,cars,https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/6o0108/tesla_model_3_should_you_buy_elon_musks_first/dkdkc26/,True,,2017,both,search,False,False,0,dkdkc26

comment,6zp9if,6zp9if,,"As of now, you need to keep your hands on the steering wheel when prompted (so the car can determine if you're conscious or not). And it's still relatively early days for autopilot. They're pushing for full autonomy but to get there, you need to test it in the field, and that's what current autopilot is, the 'beta' if you will. Tesla drivers are reminded that it isn't a driving replacement, and because it's still quite early on, it's not perfect. And for that reason, you need to stay alert.

Granted, in the future, you won't need to stay alert, but to get autopilot to the stage where you can fall asleep in the car and wake up at your destination, you have to get through these stages first. Unfortunately it almost certainly means a few deaths, be that the autopilots fault or not, but in the end, you're gonna end up saving a lot more lives.",850,False,1505250275.0,2017-09-12 23:04:35,29,0,[deleted],elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/6zp9if/tesla_autopilot_partly_to_blame_for_crash_says/dmx4pes/,True,,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,dmx4pes

Tesla still need to deliver on their promises but until then, this is still in the *potential* category of game-changers. 

I don’t wanna sound like a nay-sayer because I’m far from that, but i also don’t want to fall in the trap of being a blind fan. 

Edit: 

There's been a few replies to this comment and another comment about my ""cautiously optimistic"" statement. I'll try to reply to those comments as well but I wanted to add an edit here to get ahead of the ""you're wrong"" replies. 

My comment here is not meant to say that Tesla will not fulfill their promise, nor am I trying to argue that Tesla is not currently in a good situation. I'm just addressing the comment that the Semi will put Tesla in a good situation. I believe the Semi **can** put Tesla in a good situation but as of right now, it can't do much other than fuel the hype. There are no Tesla's on the road transporting goods, or even Tesla semis in production, it's simply a POC right now and trying to shake up the industry. 

So again, I'll reiterate what my comment was originally trying to say. The Semi *can* be a big deal, the Semi *can* become a game-changer, the Semi *can* put Tesla in a good situation, but as of December 19 2017, the Tesla Semi is simply just another proof of concept similar to the [Nikola Corp](https://nikolamotor.com/one) electric semi.",1402,False,1513693981.0,2017-12-19 15:33:01,609,0,Ragnar_Targaryen,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7ktg18/ups_preorders_125_tesla_electric_trucks/drh09ma/,True,,2017,tesla,top,False,False,0,drh09ma

comment,81xi87,81xi87,,"Your comment had me wondering, how expensive is it really? Obviously the Tesla's are luxury priced, but then again isn't Europe the place where people get taxi'ed in Mercedes? Can the alledged lower running costs of a Tesla Model S make up the cost difference? I dug around and found this

According to [this source](https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/Netherlands/diesel_prices/), the average diesel price in the Netherlands for the past few months has been 1,27 euros per liter, that's $5.9/gallon. Gasoline is even worse, 1.55 euros per liter or $7.22/gallon, but for the sake of the argument let's go with diesel.

According to [this source](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/8/8c/Electricity_prices%2C_first_half_of_year%2C_2015-2017.png), the average **household** price of a kWh of energy in the Netherlands in the 1st semester of last year was 0.156 euros per kWh, non-household is considerably lower, but let's go with worst case scenario.

The first Model S seen in the picture has a 85 kWh battery, according [to this source](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=32557) to be good enough for 265 miles, or 426 km. But let's go with 400 km to round it down, that's 4.7 km per kWh

Now let's find a comparable car to match the Tesla against.

comment,86gcae,86gcae,,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford

In the early 1920s, Ford sponsored a weekly newspaper that published strongly antisemitic views. At the same time, Ford had a reputation as one of the few major corporations actively hiring black workers, and was not accused of discrimination against Jewish workers or suppliers. He also hired women and handicapped men at a time when doing so was uncommon.[57]

In 1918, Ford's closest aide and private secretary, Ernest G. Liebold, purchased an obscure weekly newspaper for Ford, The Dearborn Independent. The Independent ran for eight years, from 1920 until 1927, with Liebold as editor. Every Ford franchise nationwide had to carry the paper and distribute it to its customers.

During this period, Ford emerged as ""a respected spokesman for right-wing extremism and religious prejudice"", reaching around 700,000 readers through his newspaper.[58] The 2010 documentary film Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story (written by Pulitzer Prize winner Ira Berkow) states that Ford wrote on May 22, 1920: ""If fans wish to know the trouble with American baseball they have it in three words—too much Jew.""[59]

comment,88fxum,88fxum,,"Not sure why every time there’s a Tesla autopilot crash in the news it makes everyone panic... the fact that autopilot is no where near perfected is not news. I have less than 500 miles on my model S and have had to manually take over autopilot 4-5 times already to prevent a crash. It’s no where near perfected. It’s not even fully released yet. We are still in beta. We arnt even discussing fsd. The enhanced autopilot option (which is what’s currently on the streets) is no where near a full release. Until recently, the car wasn’t even using all of its cameras. Enhanced autopilot once complete will allow for use of 4/8 of the cameras on board while fsd will use 8/8. Until this newest update we were at 1/8. Not sure where exactly we stand right now as there’s been some back and forth. 

The point is autopilot is currently a driver convenience feature not a self driving feature. You need to have your eyes on the road at all times. Unless the car shifted instantly into the barrier (which it did not), this is the drivers fault, not Teslas. Anyone who owns these cars are fully aware of their current capabilities. Not saying that the driver was stretching them but maybe was distracted. Nothing that happened here doesn’t happen daily. These accidents are usually just manually prevented.

> &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; co-host Gayle King experienced the autopilot system in the Tesla Model 3 this week and asked CEO Elon Musk about the safety concerns.

> &quot;The system worked as described, which is that it&#039;s a hands-on system. It is not a self-driving system,&quot; Musk said.

comment,8c280j,8c280j,,"It's actually a pretty interesting point. Often people think, automate, automate, automate, the more we automate the better - cheaper assembly, faster, more precise.

The problem is that in reality, certain tasks are easier than others for a machine to do, certain tasks are easier than other for humans to do, and there are many cases when a specific task is easy for a machine and hard for a person, or vice versa.

Automation is the question of spending vs saving.

On the spending side: time and money for R&D, then capex to build/buy the thing, the time and money for maintenance, upgrades, debugging, etc, not to mention stuff like initial trial runs probably resulting in scraps ... sometimes very expensive scraps ... or the machine fucking up (breaking, going out of tolerance, being mis-maintained) mid-production-run and scrapping an entire part of the run.

On the saving side: human labor to do the same thing.

Look at fast food, for example, and the automation they try to do. On the front end, cashiers are being replaced by machines, in some locations. On the back end, I don't see much motion to replace fry cooks with robots. However, the tools used to cook a burger are partially automated - temperatures, timers, beeps and boops - a grill set up to churn out McD burgers is not the same as a grill set to churn out brunch burgers cooked to spec. doneness with fixins.",3773,True,1523669385.0,2018-04-14 03:29:45,64,0,gimpwiz,cars,https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8c280j/elon_musk_admits_yes_excessive_automation_at/dxbzkuj/,True,,2018,both,search,False,False,0,dxbzkuj

A second screen or HUD would go a long way. Most cars have nice two screen setups by now (including the Model S). 

Big points off for steering feel. The steering was the most electronic feeling mill I’ve ever turned. All the entry level Germans are far better in what is communicated back to the driver. 

The trunk feels and sounds flimsy to close. The frunk even moreso; I was worried I was going to bend or dent it when trying to shut it. 

The glass roof is a novelty that does nothing to make the car feel more premium to me, but I get why others like it.

I will say that the audio quality of the stereo is up there with the best Ive heard, but that being said, the music interface was confusing, and the built in streaming radio often failed to load despite having four bars of cell signal. 

For many people, the drivetrain and green aspect will make up for all that. And my perceptions of what a sedan interior should be are colored by years of being shown very nice European interiors.

Not everyone is comfortable with the position they're in or with their disability, and remarks like these can have huge implications for some people.

The rest mostly makes sense, but these two rules are fucking retarded.

Number of reports is not a legitimate metric to determine if something should be censored or not, that's called mob rule and is an invitation for politically-motivated randoms to tactically censor information. Where's the part about human intervention to confirm whether or not the content is actually objectionable (or just unpopular with certain demographics who are unscrupulous enough to mass-report it)?

And according to the second rule, Musk himself would be banned from this subreddit, as calling people pedos without evidence is a perfect example of both ""attacking others"" and ""offensive language"".

Where is the rule about trying to pushing blatant propaganda that's been debunked over and over, such as Tesla getting more subsidies than others car companies?

comment,a8zuie,a8zuie,,">Why are EVs still so expensive? It's literally not worth it to buy them unless you're a cab driver stuck in stand-still traffic daily.

Batteries are still very expensive. The price has come down a lot in recent years, but they're still very expensive to manufacture. 


>Why did Musk have so much difficulty perfecting the car for the factory when logically it would seem an EV would be easier to make?

Building a modern car is very hard. There are tens of thousands of hours and billions of dollars put into their development. Every other manufacturer has decades of experience perfecting their manufacturing process. Tesla itself is only 15 years old and they're only been seriously making cars for 6 years. They just don't have that same level of experience that others have. 


>Why do Teslas typically have more capacity than other cars like Nissan's Leaf? Just bigger cells?

I think there are two main reasons for this. Firstly, Teslas are bigger and heavier than most EVs. As a result, they need to store more energy. It's like how gas cars use bigger and more powerful engines in big cars. When you compare Teslas to similarly sized EVs, their battery capacity is very similar. 

The second part of this is that other EVs typically have had different goals than Teslas. Teslas aim to be a complete and total replacement to gas cars. They're made to allow you to take road trips or drive longer distances. Other EVs have historically been compliance cars.",1742,True,1545613849.0,2018-12-24 02:10:49,14,0,Fugner,cars,https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/a8zuie/why_is_tesla_model_3_such_a_big_deal/ecffvln/,True,,2018,both,search,False,False,0,ecffvln

Whether customers got hooked on those extra features enough to pay for them, however, remains to be seen.

this is the same exact situation as, say, setting up an account with a VPN service and they provide you with the ultra-fast, super-fancy Pro account for a week for free, and then after that week is up they 'downgrade' you to the account you actually signed up for, with the reminder that you can get all those nice features if you just cough up some more cash.

I'm not sure what is up with the one you rented but I had no problems with the headrest and my shoulders and all that.

I also found the same problems you found with AutoPilot. It makes some *strange* decisions at times when traveling at speed in moderate traffic. It tends to work best with either a lot of slow traffic or no traffic, moderate traffic gives it the most problems. My friend says that during his morning commute he barely pays attention anymore, the car does all the work for him, since it's mostly bumper to bumper up the highway to his office.

As far as connecting with the car goes, it definitely feels like you're driving an Apple Car. The way everything is designed reminds me of my company iPhone. It's sleek and nice looking but when you need to do something nitty gritty it's a pain in the ass and often locked away from you without hacking the software. The Tesla UI feels very similar to that. I still found myself being able to enjoy driving the car, as it is RWD with Instant Torque and I didn't find the steering to be as vague as you did. I thought the steering was precise enough to enjoy the car when you were on a windy road.

comment,d48wyg,d48wyg,,"Awesome share! I’ve been wondering this myself following their video. 

From everything you say, it sounds like the Kia system is almost as capable as the Mercedes system.

I’ve spent a lot of time with the 2019 Mercedes Drive Assist or whatever it’s called, and it’s criminally underrated. It can do everything you mentioned + slow down on curves (usually too much for my tastes but that’s a different story) + change lanes upon direction. I don’t think it’s as good as the Tesla system but it’s pretty damn good. Hands off steering wheel it’ll complain after about 45 seconds and start to shut down after around 80 seconds. 

Volvo’s Drive Pilot is pretty good but requires too much hand-on-steering wheel. I think it balks after 15 seconds. 

Subaru and Toyota are decent but too jerky. They were somewhere between Volvo and Mercedes in terms of hand on steering wheel requirement.  

Of course, the hands-off time is usually time spent in stop and go traffic when most of these systems really shine. Or also clear wide open roads like parts of the mid-west. 

In all, I’m thrilled to see the continued development on this front, and in 5-7 years, smooth controlled assisted driving will be mainstream.",1205,False,1568496176.0,2019-09-14 23:22:56,13,0,Alienblueacct,cars,https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/d48wyg/is_kia_tellurides_driving_assist_system_as_good/f098wug/,True,,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,f098wug

I know, hence why I specified “basic AP” 😉 (what my car, and I suspect most future Teslas, will have, since no one wants to pay $6k got a feature set that largely doesn’t exist yet). It ought to work like Kia’s system, automatically re-engaging after a manual lane change has been completed. 

> I recently turned on the ""creep"" setting in my Model S and I've found it goes in to ""HOLD"" mode way more often now in traffic.

My buddy has a Model 3 and its fine but not my thing, I fill up gas once a month, my city is small, it isn't for me.

As for a 3 series, or Audi S4 etc I considered them but didn't like the hp trade off for the money. An equivalent 50k 3 series, Audi etc would have under 300hp and I wouldn't enjoy the maintenance out of warranty. Not to mention they look very generic. The Stinger stands out, has the engine to back it up and the interior quality that the BMW would be better at when compared to the Stinger isn't worth the trade off. The Stinger interior in my opinion is nice and I'm not an interior snob so moving to a BMW would, in my opinion, be like buying a lesser car for more money for a badge.

This is the big one. If you're going to sell ten million cars you're going to need *seventy billion* batteries... that supply chain will easily take 10-20 years to establish.

comment,gndux9,gndux9,,"financially, leasing is a terrible deal - HOWEVER, if you value having a new / updated car every few years then its fine. Just realize youre paying a premium to do so.

leasing: sure hte monthly payment is less, less to deal with in maintenace, better tax advantages if business usage, no worry of trade in value

BUT - no equity, mileage limits / costs?, acquisition / lease initiation fees?, extra charges for wear and tear 'above normal'

--> financially, teh value/return on ownership comes from owning it for 5+ years and continues to improve barring any major major maintenance issues


Its like whole life insurance - sounds good, and looks fine. YOu pay into it for like 10 years, and the returns are fine / similar to investing the money in the market... however your upside is capped and if you had just invested hte money in the market for 30+ years, you really start seeing that difference and much better overall value / return after that time period. YOu continue to get exponential returns wher as your insurance policy is - well - that amount.

hence why a 25-30 year term policy and investing the rest yields a much superior return after that 25-30 years, and you use term insurance to cover you for hte period < than that


**tl;dr** - lease if you value driving a new car every 3 years and are willing ot pay for it. realize your paying a premium to do so, which shoulld be expeceted.",2414,True,1590022102.0,2020-05-21 02:48:22,10,0,akmalhot,investing,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/gndux9/number_of_unpaid_credit_card_accounts_in_april/frammcf/,True,,2020,tesla,top,False,False,0,frammcf

Translation:

Audi stops plans for semi-autonomous A8

Audi says goodbye to its plans to offer the current A8 generation, the first production car with autonomous driving functions according to Level 3. The legal basis for this is still missing.

When the fourth generation of the Audi A8 was presented in the summer of 2017, the luxury-class saloon was intended to breathe new life into the slogan ""Vorsprung durch Technik"". The model was the first production car worldwide to be ready for autonomous driving to Level 3.

This includes, for example, a motorway assistant where the driver can turn his attention to other things. The vehicle not only maintains the speed and the distance to the vehicle in front fully automatically, but also changes lanes automatically by overtaking.

So far, however, no Audi A8 has been delivered with the corresponding software enabled. The reason is the lack of a legal basis. After an initial euphoria, also in politics, there are still no regulations on the use of automated driving functions in public road traffic.",2550,True,1599661907.0,2020-09-09 16:31:47,7,0,Astratum,cars,https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/ipcn8b/germany_wants_to_become_a_pioneer_in_autonomous/g4js7cw/,True,,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,g4js7cw

comment,ipp3e9,ipp3e9,,"I think your framework is correct, but your analysis is wrong. Here are some inconsistencies I noticed in your theory:

When you say:

>**Catalysts**: These are are things required to trigger a bubble collapse. Almost every bubble has had some notable catalyst(s) to trigger the rapid decline. As mentioned in Profit Taking, **we've had three catalysts occur so far that triggered panic selling. New Tesla shares, secondary Tesla offloading, and Softbank.** They are the big one and who I will focus on for a minute.

Why do you think Tesla stock split + dilution is a catalyst for the market crash? I don't think that makes sense. As for Softbank, they bought calls in mainly the FAANG stocks, they didn't buy Calls on the whole market. Could Tech stocks crashing back to say, April levels, bring us back to SPY under 300? Sure. But re-test and breach the March lows? No way, not with the amount of liquidity sloshing around out there with 0% Interest Rates.

&#x200B;

>Market cap to GDP was 2:1 at peak. The dotcom crash was 1.4 and the recession was 1.1. Currently 1.77:1.

The Wilshire Index (AKA the ""Buffet Indicator"") is outdated and no longer relevant in my opinion. It's supposed to be a measure of US domiciled publicly traded companies Market Cap vs the GDP of the US. What it doesn't take into account however, is that most US business do business overseas, and not just in the US. Therefore, it's no longer a good measure for how ""over valued"" or ""under valued"" a US company is.",3643,True,1599691654.0,2020-09-10 00:47:34,144,0,LuxGang,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ipp3e9/dont_be_fooled_this_is_the_market_crash_my_dd/g4lg9ey/,True,,2020,tesla,top,False,False,0,g4lg9ey

It's very interesting that the bull and bear traps look exactly the same and they exist very close to each other on the spectrums (the bear trap basically leads right into the bull trap, post blow-off.). That's totally where my issue lies in my own argument. I wasn't sure if this was another violent shake-off leading into the last phase or if it was the crash itself. I'm still not entirely convinced it's not the crash though. Like you said, there needs to be confirmation one way or another.

It really doesn't take much to start a bubble crashing. One thing can cause others to compound on each other. Catalysts don't all have to be covid level to trigger a collapse. Looking into the dotcom bust, the catalyst was money managers urging their clients to rebalance their portfolios. That looks awfully similar to Tesla's second largest stockholder doing the same. Nothing is ever the same twice, and it's totally ridiculous to count Tesla as the main driver of this, but at the same time, they represent the emotional sentiment of this market as a whole.

comment,kd58rt,kd58rt,,"The ""old"" V2 supercharger stalls share a power feed.  This means 2 stalls are on 1 feed, and if both stalls are occupied, you cannot achieve the maximum charge speed due to having to share the available power.

New ""v3"" type chargers do not have this problem. They can charge with up to 250kW and no need to worry about sharing your feed.

Charging to 100% is not efficient as the last 10-20% go really slow, but charging from 10-80% should take no more than 30 minutes under good circumstances.

The short interest results that were posted 1/27 were actually settled 1/15. There has been enough volatility in the past 2 weeks for shorts to easily close out without anyone noticing. If that's true, it would make sense for them (or anyone) to short again while above 300, especially if they knew the original 61 million shorts were already cleared.

People also keep saying ""Days to Cover is still 2.5!"" Yeah, that doesn't mean anything in a volatile market like this. Days to Cover, aka Short Interest, is a function of (Shares Shorted) / (Avg Volume). Avg volume is over the past 30 days. The first 15 of the past 30 days saw much lower volume. Current Short Ratio is closer to 0.5-1. If they could cover their entire positions in 1 day (causing a spike obviously), who's to say they didn't clear over a 10 day period (causing the spikes we saw), then, knowing they lost $4 billion (if cleared around the $62 price range, which I suspect), why not take out new short positions around $300? The price can't go up any more if there's no short squeeze coming.

Just my 2 cents. I get downvoted for this on WSB, so it's apparent no one wants to objectively discuss this very real possibility.

comment,lc0lv6,lc0lv6,,"As a certified car history nerd, Elon isn't wrong.
Every attempt at mass production from an automotive start-up almost certainly fails after only a few years.

Bricklin and Delorean are 2 of the most notable examples of fairly popular cars that failed after a few years due to budgetary constraints.

I'm sure we've all seen the magic car triangle of ""fast, cheap, good"". Well auto startups somehow have to do all 3 by a miracle to hit market in time.

Delorean Motor Company at least had the benefit of John being an industry veteran with a ton of connections. He knew how to set up mass production in a certain budget. It's why Deloreans are actually pretty damn good build quality. However, as history tells, he could only get so far. 

Tesla gets credit where credit is due. I know Elon didn't create Tesla, but his efforts to keep pumping money into it, playing politics, and building hype have made Tesla a historic achievement for sure.

Edit: And to clarify, the build quality of a Delorean was good, but the part quality was shit. They would light on fire, and as many know, were slow as all hell.

That's a fact, not pretending anything as the timeline is pretty clear.


Musk was sued by the founder because he presented himself as co-founder in interviews. They settled the lawsuit. The agreement says Musk (and some others) can call themselves founders too and the founder won't sue again.... Musk paid him to settle this. He bought the title. 

The settlement doesn't mean he actually is the founder or that any news outlet or *you* have to call him founder. The settlement just says Musk may call himself founder without being sued for it again.

And that's with the dotcom bubble and recession wiping out large percentages.

EDIT:

FINAL UPDATE - Apologies for taking so long to give an update here, I just wanted to wait to confirm whether this was an ongoing issue or not. Once Tesla got engaged, they were great about getting the car in quickly and doing all the diagnostic work they could think of. They had even seen my Reddit posts, so they were up to date on the situation without having to explain anything.

The weren’t able to replicate the issue, but wound up replacing the charge port anyway to be safe. The data from the car suggested a voltage spike during charging which caused the charge port to enter a fault  state and shut off. It’s unclear why the cord would not disengage, but I’m assuming it was able to do so once that fault cleared itself overnight. This makes some sense as it was pouring rain a few minutes prior to us charging, which I was told is the main culprit for this voltage spike fault.

Since then, we’ve had no issues with charging (knock on wood).",1585,True,1616133469.0,2021-03-19 06:57:49,1703,0,SeaEnergy,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/m8ac8v/130am_update_still_trapped_at_a_supercharger/grgbbix/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,grgbbix

Tesla had it easy because they knew they had a popular product on their hands that people were showing interest in, and knew that the only way they could truly grow EVs in a time where charging wasn’t even remotely commonplace was take the plunge into building a charging network. - Otherwise they’d have cars that people were intrigued by but weren’t legitimately viable to purchase. Even if you get subsidized, your company still needs sales to continue existing and growing. 

Hydrogen doesn’t have this kind of advantage (yet). Even if we went and subsidized hydrogen to hell and back, there’s effectively no cars right now that would be able to use it - and manufacturers won’t build out on their own unless they know it’ll generate a return, which it won’t until said manufacturers have cars to utilize it.

It’s just how businesses work. Once there’s a viable return, companies will jump into the market, but they need the initial push to do so  - and it’s not only “free” money that can give the initial push, it’s customers buying the brand.

comment,nhfij4,nhfij4,,"As a Tesla owner with the FSD package, this statement is ridiculous:

>Its time and energy could be better spent on developing a driver monitoring system for Autopilot to significantly improve the safety and usefulness of that system.

No. Just no. Cameras on the driver isn't going to make their systems ""safer"" or more ""useful"".

For all the situations that FSD is advertised to be used in, and many that it isn't, their systems do an A+ job at both piloting the vehicle and alerting the driver to take over when the AI isn't confident what to do.

Auto-Steer and Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, often referred to together as Autopilot, can't drive _everywhere_, but the number situations they can handle extremely well is impressive. Freeways have been a solved problem for Tesla for years. Lane changes, also solved for freeways and city streets. Stop signs, street lights, construction zones, speed limit signs, all solved with vision -- the car will come to a complete stop at a stop sign without intervention, or would slow down and alert the driver when entering a construction zone. Even roads with poor or no lane markings are handled quite well. If the car isn't confident, it prompts the driver to take over. It's a PHENOMENAL system.

Only uniformed people who hear ""Autopilot"" and jump to the conclusion that it should be able to take you from A to B without intervention complain. Nobody is claiming that it does that. It's a driver _assist_ system, it's not a replacement for a driver.",2392,True,1621566112.0,2021-05-21 05:01:52,80,0,A_Crunchy_Leaf,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nhfij4/consumer_reports_publishes_scathing_review_of/gywhnle/,True,,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,gywhnle

comment,nm4kla,nm4kla,,"There's some very good info here, but you haven't explicitly stated the fundamental operation of the balance sheet.  Why is it called that?  The accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Equities.  If you add up everything that belongs in the asset section of the balance sheet the total MUST equal the sum of everything in the liabilities and equities sections.  

If our business is a farm, the assets are the farm land, the barn, the tractors, and the crops.  The liabilities are the mortgage and the workers pay that they earned last week, but the farm has paid yet.  The equity is the cash the farmer used to buy the farm and the profit that the farmer has not paid to himself.  

Under normal circumstances, the crops are sold.  This reduces the crop asset, but increases the cash asset.  Hopefully we sold the crops for more than their value on the balance sheet and turned a profit. That means the cash asset increases more than the crop asset decreases.  The difference is added to retained earnings, which is part of the equities section.  We are still in balance.

 Then, we pay the mortgage and the workers.  The cash asset is reduced and the mortgage and worker pay liabilities are reduced.

comment,nqs5v0,nqs5v0,,"On the highway, Autopilot depends more on the forward radar than the cameras. The radar is more accurate for detecting the range to other vehicles and it can ""see"" farther. The problem is that the radar attempts to filter out non-moving objects so that you're not stopping or swerving because of a discarded soda can or overhead sign. 

This is also the source of phantom braking. If we cull out too many non-moving objects, we hit parked emergency vehicles. If we cull out too few, we get phantom braking whenever a random piece of metal debris creates a radar reflection. This is a common problem for *every* auto manufacturer's radar-based TACC, not just Tesla's. Most of them solve it by removing *all* stopped-object radar returns and warn you (in the owner's manual) that it will not reliably detect stopped vehicles. They only activate the brakes when the obstacle is close enough to trigger Automatic Emergency Braking. 

Tesla is trying split the difference and develop a radar algorithm that can detect stopped obstacles yet ignore non-obstacle objects and debris. To do that, they often tweak the software to fine-tune exactly what kinds of radar returns are legitimate. That's why phantom braking seems to come and go depending on the software version.",1541,True,1622658353.0,2021-06-02 20:25:53,436,0,majesticjg,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/nqs5v0/autopilot_didnt_see_a_broken_down_truck_partially/h0cdt1d/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,h0cdt1d

Jeeze with that fact this story reads more as an argument to wear your seatbelt than an indictment of autonomous driving technology worthy of the front page of the NYT.

I think it's pretty obvious that driver assist / autonomous features are going to save lives long term, and perhaps they already are (you just don't get headlines with ""car doesn't crash""). 

Tesla is already adding more advanced driver monitoring technology using the in-cabin driver facing camera that's been shipping for years.

In level 2 you could have a vehicle that does lane assist and automatic cruise control or you could have a vehicle that will make turns for you and stop at stop lights both at level 2. At level 4 you could have a simple car system at an amusement park that picks up and drops of customers in defined locations on a defined paths and never go over 20 mph or you could have an off-roading semi truck that picks up logs in the forest and and brings them back to the mill.

I think it's possible to have a Level 5 autonomous vehicle but it's a long way off. I also think that mixing autonomous vehicles with human drivers is a bad idea because humans are such god awful drivers doing random shit while autonomous vehicles are programmed to handle a subset of that random driving. 

If everyone on the road followed the same rules exactly, the roads would be more efficient and safer, autonomous vehicles or not. 

I keep thinking of that accident in CA that killed that kid in the pick-up truck. I watched the video and saw dozens of potential failure points. Computer vision might not have made out the truck from the wall of trucks in front initially or when it changed lanes. The signal light the driver put on may or may not have meant a coming lane change (people to put them on or leave them on by accident). The car sped up possibly by not seeing the truck and misjudging the distance. The brake lights might have come from, according to the car sensors, from the trucks about 20 feet further down the road. Then, when it ""saw"" the truck it mis-judged the braking.

Yes, this is a problem. It sometimes does not 'see' stationary vehicles just off the road. 

When driving on AP, my attention is on 'unusual' conditions that may require me to take control, in particular, work areas, and vehicles in the breakdown lane. These can be seen quite some distance ahead, with plenty of time to take over.

AP remains a very real positive though; it takes over the continuous attention and adjustments required to stay in lane, and at the proper
spacing with other cars. It *greatly* reduces the cognitive load of highway driving, and I arrive much less fatigued on a long trip.

Note that there are at least 3 levels of autonomy at play here. AP, which I have, is the lowest.

So here is the biggest difference that had most people in automotive circles in a fit when autopilot was released. The fine print might’ve suggested that one shouldn’t ever stop engaging with the wheel, but the advertising and all the write ups from Tesla’s marketing was about a level of autonomous driving that no one in the industry has yet to achieve.

comment,qbz5rx,qbz5rx,,"With all due respect, this type of post makes me want to go buy Tesla stock. 

You’re right they don’t get the same amount of sales as traditional car makers. But they offer arguably the best EVs on the market. 

Their fans aren’t delusional. It’s marketing. Same reason iPhone sales never slowed down despite Android users having all the “top features” before them. The issue is here is Tesla has the marketing of Apple, and the “cost” of the android. 

What do you mean by “no actual data”? Are they supposed to release statistical results of products years before they release them? 

Autopilot is getting sued and rightfully so. There have been accidents and deaths. But there is a difference between their autopilot and self driving packages. And the thing is, no other car maker has an auto pilot software package that comes close to Tesla. Yes there are assisted driving packages, but Tesla also has over 5 years of data for their autopilot and self driving features. That data is the most valuable thing for them, as it will keep their software years ahead of the competition. Would I personally use autopilot? No. But is Tesla the world lead in automated driving? Yes. 

Honestly, you need to define what “catch up” means. Are traditional car makers going to catch up in EV sales? Yes. Most carmakers have begun the process of transitioning fully electric. And have bigger portfolios.

What Happened: Ark analyst Tasha Keeney said speculation has been rife that Tesla is planning a ride-hailing network after its recent software update that allows owners to share the vehicle with others via the phone app.   
A Twitter account that monitors the app store for any new updates on the Tesla app, had last week revealed that the new version of the electric vehicle maker’s mobile app has a feature that allows owners to share cars.  
Version 4.3.1 has been released here's what we've found:

Few questions, 

First, did YOU see the chaos up ahead and decide to just let it run its course and see what AP would do, or were you blind (or inattentive) as well?

Second, in your professional opinion as a human who holds a drivers license, do you think that swerving was the right move? Do you think that you had enough braking distance to slam on the brakes instead?

comment,ryno36,ryno36,,"Ever since 2016, when Tesla released that smoke and mirror misleading demo, I’ve been telling people the state of FSD isn’t remotely close to what Tesla/Elon portrayed it. 

I tried to talk a coworker out of paying for FSD on his 2016 Model S 90D lease and he didn't listen, and he ended up paying $3k (price back then) for literally *zero* functionality until the end of the lease. 

The amount of misinformation and lack of understanding of this topic within the Tesla community is just straight up nauseating. Its clear as day Tesla is far behind industry leaders such as Waymo, yet I just kept hearing the absurd “Waymo cars drive on rails because HD map hur hur!” argument…

Elon already admitted that Tesla screwed up *majorly* in their stubborn decision to develop a FSD system out of a driver assist system (hence the rewrite 2 years ago), and now they are about 2-3 years in to the development cycle of the new stack and is making good progress by solving low hanging fruits, which means they have *at least* 5+ years to go before they even get close to robotaxi level automation.

I think a lot of the hate/anger/criticism against Tesla is overblown, especially on this sub, but this is one area where *somebody* needs to step in and at least slap them on the wrist.

Now, let’s get specific. Your problem is that you assumed that Tesla would grow revenue 26% per year and profit 29% per year (much lower than what they are guiding for, but ok) through 2030 and still get a P/E of 15? That’s ridiculously low for that level of growth. AMZN P/E is around 74 ($3,100 divided by $41.91 EPS excluding one time Rivian stock gain) for lower levels of growth. And before you pull the “but it’s an automotive company” bullshit, think for a second. Tesla already has the highest net income margin in the automotive business and still expanding, has virtually no debt, and has been able to grow faster than any other automotive company. Nothing about Tesla’s business fundamentals says it’s a traditional auto, and it should not be valued as such. You will never see Tesla at 15 P/E this decade.

Your other problem is assuming flat net income margin through 2030. Tesla has shown incredible and consistent operating leverage (meaning operating expenses grow more slowly than revenue/gross profit) hence their constant margin expansion over the last couple years. This is probably your most bearish assumption.

comment,v1itrt,v1itrt,,"I’m the opposite of a Tesla fanboy, but what large NYSE listed car manufacturers aren’t down significantly? Ford is down 50%, GM 40%, and even Toyota and Ferrari have been down close to 30%.

Tesla gets the headlines because of its overall valuation, but on percentage terms, it’s only down marginally higher than other large car stocks.

Having said that, investors priced Tesla at its peak like it’s the Apple of car stocks. The car industry is vastly different, and I’m of the opinion that the new Toyota EV (the Toyota BZ4X) is going to fly off the shelves. Not because it’s the best EV or has the best performance figures, but because Toyota has some of the most loyal customers in the world. It’s perceived as the most reliable and trustworthy brand, and it’s why the Corolla and RAV4 are the two highest selling cars by volume in the world. The Corolla isn’t the best car in its class, but everyone that buys it knows what they’re getting (reliability, ease of use, build quality, resale value, good capped priced servicing etc).

Tesla don’t even make the best EV in the world. The best EV according to various 2021 car of the year awards is the Kia EV6. 

The interesting aspect to Tesla that I’m waiting to see play out is the polarising views of Musk himself. For the most part, he’d successfully imaged himself as a tech pioneer like Gates or Jobs, but unlike them, he hasn’t been able to remain as apolitical.

Coming from the ICE world it's a weird feeling to drive 70 in an 80 mph limit. But there weren't many cars and I just kept to the right. I also mentally prepared myself to drive about 10 hours at 65 - 70 mph, rather than try to beat the navigation's ETA.

Regarding efficiency, definitely be aware of headwinds. A 15 mph headwind (not unheard of along I-40) will give driving at 85 mph the efficiency of driving at 100 (nearly), and that reduces efficiency way more than you'd expect.

Another thing you can do is find a tractor trailer going a comfortable speed, then use Autopilot to stay \~3 car lengths back (Autopilot setting, which is much greater than 3 car lengths in practice).

Here's the report: https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2022/INOA-EA22002-3184.PDF

To summarize: 

11 reports of Teslas striking first-responders while in Autopilot caused the NHTSA to open an investigation.  They found the results concerning enough that they widened the investigation beyond those initial cases.

They found 191 other cases of Autopilot crashes.  85 of those either did not have sufficient data to investigate or had mitigating factors like the crash being caused by the other driver, leaving 106 crashes where the Tesla driver was clearly at fault.

Of the 106 ""approximately half"" could be attributed to drivers not paying attention, not having their hands on the wheel, or not responding to vehicle attention prompts.

Of the 106 ""approximately a quarter"" could be attributed to operating the system in environments where it's not fully supported, like outside of a highway or in weather conditions such as rain, snow, or ice.

That leaves 37 cases where it appears the cars malfunctioned, both not prompting the driver and not taking preventative action like braking until it was too late to avoid the crash or not at all.

This report says that they are now escalating the investigation further to do an actual engineering analysis of the Tesla systems to understand the root cause of the defects.

Yes, but because it is a bear market, and many stocks are likely to make new lows in the coming months.

- TSLA is flat (up 0.6%)

- AMZN is down 36%

- MSFT is down 4%

Elon doesn't really have a leg to stand on legally, he waived due diligence and agreed to buy Twitter with two outs, materially false info which he can't really claim because he waived due diligence (unless Twitter lied to everyone), or he failed to get financing, which he also can't claim because he can just sell more Tesla stock.  The $1 billion breakup fee required one of these two legit outs for Elon, if his reason for walking away isn't one of these two reasons, Twitter can force him to pay the agreed upon price or pay a much larger break up fee.

He isn't even claiming the bot number are wrong in his ""termination"" letter just that they didn't give him info, which can easily be proven false.  They gave him sensitive internal data when he wasn't even entitled to it.

Twitter has zero reason to let Elon walk away, and if the Courts move more quickly than expected they have even less of a reason to renegotiate if that is the actual goal.

* Musk's Lawyer's know they can't get out on reps and warrants, and have instead flooded Twitter with requests for information about bots.  Twitter says their mDAU and Bots and Spam figures are calculated with real personal data (phone numbers, IPs, locations, etc.), and they can't legally share this with Musk's team for privacy reasons.  They also are not obligated to share information that could put them at a competitive disadvantage if the deal were to fail, and much of their methodology and analysis around bots and spam falls in this category.
* Skadden (Musk's law firm) says Twitters unwillingness to hand over aforementioned data is a breach of the information covenant, and grounds for termination.  Again, there are probably good legal reasons Twitter is being cagey here.

Berlin is hoping to hit 2,000 per week soon, and perhaps 5,000 per week late this year. In Q4 alone and barring any major shutdowns or depressions (seemingly more likely by the day) Tesla's 4 factories could produce 300,000 model Ys.

With Berlin and Austin just starting to ramp, it seems Tesla is hoping to produce around 1.5m model Ys next year, I can't see a market for that many $50k+ variants, so I imagine price cuts would be in order, but who knows?

comment,xec5wv,xec5wv,,"# “The person in the driver’s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not driving anything. The car is driving itself.”

I think this quote says it all.  Tesla claimed that their self driving tech was so close to release that the only obstacle was regulatory approval.  This was absolutely 100% a lie at the time it was claimed.  And that claim sold not just Autopilot but a lot of Tesla cars.  ""It's an Appreciating Asset because it has the hardware to be a robotaxi!"" That's a claim that Elon has made numerous times.

Elon has also said that 'there was no question, guaranteed, based on the data he's seeing internally that FSD would be as safe or safer than a person by the end of the year without any supervision.'

This is also 100% a lie.  If we look at the public FSD Beta Tracker data, FSD Beta is **today** many orders of magnitude away from human safety (unsupervised) and the trend lines **today** are definitely *not* trending toward human safety within the next 2+ years.

There's being overly optimistic and there's a lie that's counter to all of the data.    If I say ""Based on my current speed I'll be in the office in 30 minutes."" but you're in New York City and the office is in LA, it's not being ""overly optimistic"" that you'll maybe get abducted by aliens and carried by a UFO at hypersonic speeds and then dropped off in the parking lot... you're lying.

comment,xvg2gw,xvg2gw,,"A Tesla loses about 2 miles of range per WEEK from phantom drain. If you have sentry mode on, the car not only doesn't shut off, but it is running all the cameras and GPU in the computer constantly; it uses about 2 miles range per HOUR.

As you can imagine, running the AC uses energy too. Don't use sentry mode at home, and don't use cabin overheat protection unless you mean to.

With regards to Autopilot (not FSD), it's simple traffic-aware cruise control with a little integration with speed limits (which you can configure). My experience is that it has been pretty much on par with other Adaptive Cruise Control systems from other brands (Skoda, Kia, and GM). The thing that throws most people off is that if you set it up to pay attention to the speed limit, it can get the speed limits of ramps sometimes if you are too far to the right and the sign to close to the highway; that's annoying because the car will slow.",1158,False,1664898143.0,2022-10-04 17:42:23,33,0,[deleted],electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/xvg2gw/battery_drain_in_tesla_vs_etron_any_tips/ir11fzf/,True,,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,ir11fzf

My Model 3 has that because I got it before autopilot became standard, it works exactly as you would expect it to, and its kind of crazy that there isn't a way to switch to it on the newer cars.

Would also be great to see improvements to wipers. Right now there are times where the auto wipers don't react fast enough and the wiper control still feels dangerous. It has always seemed like there would be an easy way to fix it with the existing controls.

Similarly, I've never been impressed by the auto high beams, and the pop up every time I manually turn them off is kind of annoying.

comment,y407rm,y407rm,,"Cherry-picked criteria in which Tesla does do a good job.  Here's a very different set of criteria:

1. Quality of materials and workmanship.
2. Ease of use of controls and similarity for people moving from ICE vehicles.  (In other words: physical buttons)
3. Ease of installation of home charger for first-time buyers, such as including it with the purchase of the car.
4. Quiet interior.
5. Affordability.

Edit: FWIW, the above are not necessarily my criteria, and are not meant to favor, in aggregate, any one other specific car or maker.  (e.g.  #3 and #5 clearly favor GM, but #4 doesn't.)  They are just alternate criteria.  I have a Nissan Ariya reservation, and am very much looking forward to getting it later this year or early next year.  It also doesn't meet all of these.

Edit 2: My Criteria:

1. Had to meet a price point.  ($60K or less)
2. Flat or dolly towable so that I can tow it behind an RV.  This made FWD a hard requirement since there are currently no flat-towable BEVs.
3. Unloaded vehicle weight below 4700 lbs.  (Also for towing it.)
4. Refined, quiet, comfortable, interior.
5. Comfortable and roomy rear seat, preferably with seat heaters.  (I have 3 slim teenage kids.)
6. Decent amount of flat surface area when rear seat is folded down so that RC airplanes will fit reasonably well.  (I fly mainly electric ducted jets.  Another unusual requirement.)
7. 250 miles real-world range in warm weather.
8. Heat pump.
9. Good array of modern safety features.",1763,True,1665769811.0,2022-10-14 19:50:11,28,0,flyfreeflylow,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/y407rm/disappointed_in_the_ev_marketplace_and_that_tesla/isbdwgc/,True,,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,isbdwgc

Tesla is trying to tackle an incredibly hard problem. It seems like they'd like to be able to put a Tesla down anywhere, and have it ""look around"" and understand where it is and how it has to drive, and where it can go, etc. This is a very hard problem, especially if you want to be able to use the output of that observational system to inform navigation, lane choice, etc.

It also seems like Tesla is pretty worried about getting stuck at a 'local maximum' and is taking lots of measures to avoid relying on almost anything except vision for critical decisions. Or at least to have the option to change around their priorities and architecture to get out of a local maximum if they find themselves stuck there.

Hopefully getting things like picking the right lane and smooth deceleration will be easy issues to address once they're happy with how everything else is working.

comment,yw85ie,yw85ie,,"Agree with most of your post! I also went from a 2018 X to a 2022 X. 

Range - The faster charging was a huge huge bonus. We had a 75D and never realized how much slower the charging rate was. We recently went on a short road trip with the 2022 and the much improved supercharging speed was a welcomed improvement.

Controls - I got used to the yoke very quickly. While there are some who actually prefer the yoke (from reading reviews), I would have loved to have a regular steering wheel as an option. The biggest drawback, in my opinion, is not having a shifting stalk. Trying to do a three point turn in a small parking garage is not much fun using the 'swipe' shifter. I also really miss using the left and right buttons on the 75D's regular steering wheel - especially the climate controls. I find voice control for the climate can be hit or miss and having to use the centre screen for the majority of climate controls can be dangerous at times.

Build Quality - My particular build was tremendously improved compared to my 2018 75D. The 2018 had trim issues, misaligned doors, unclipped plastic pieces, just to name a few. Our 2022 was pristine. The overall interior build material and quality, while not 'luxurious' per se compared to other luxury brands, is noticeably better.

comment,z4h7mf,z4h7mf,,"From the article: Tesla has finally taken steps to fight back against owners who disregard their warnings and disclaimers and use Autopilot cheat devices to trick the car into thinking their hands are on the wheel.
With the latest release of Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta, the car can now detect if you are using an Autopilot cheat device and initiate a forced Autopilot disengagement, resulting in a strike if it happened while FSD Beta was engaged.

Since Autopilot was introduced, if you did not have your hands on the steering wheel the car would remind (or nag) you to apply force so that it knows you are still there and paying attention.

Tesla has been able to figure this out and your car can now detect when at least some of these devices are being used. According to third-party software tracker Teslascope, this new code was added with the latest FSD Beta 10.69.3.1.
This information has been corroborated by Tesla Service employees.
Tesla obviously didn’t include this new ability in the release notes, and has not officially announced it is there, so we don’t know for sure how they are detecting these devices.

One possibility is that Tesla knows when your hands are off the wheel (no force), and they also know with a high level of confidence when your hands on the wheel (varying force).",1504,True,1669393023.0,2022-11-25 17:17:03,97,0,chrisdh79,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/z4h7mf/tesla_cracks_down_on_autopilot_cheat_devices_as/ixqsad8/,True,,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,ixqsad8

Your product / service is obscure, but slap Elon Musk's name on it (*ahem, maybe pre-Twitter purchase) and suddenly it's front page news, everyone is talking about it. This massively drives investor interest and the share prices go up ... Investors make money.  So even though the company could be marginally more profitable in the short term if the CEO or other officers are paid less, investors (speaking indirectly through the board of directors) are willing to pay any price to get that brand recognition.  Of course, that person still has to run the company and theoretically those who are worth the most have got there by successfully managing other businesses... (Theoretically is the key word here)

comment,10sk1gh,10sk1gh,,"Shanghai already has capacity to produce 1.2M today. Eventually they're expecting to reach 1.5M with the newly announced expansion, although that will still take a while.

Berlin and Texas are 3 and 8 times larger than Shanghai will be respectively, so eventually I expect them to do ~2M each. Berlin has already announced to hit 500K with the first of four stages, so that seems in line with my expectation.

I do think both Berlin and Texas will do a lot more than just cars, unlike Shanghai which is purely focused on cars. So that's why I don't expect them to do 3-8x more cars than Shanghai.

Then there's Fremont, which is expected to ramp to 800K over time. So adding all of those together, it's 6.3M cars with zero downtime. I don't expect them to be fully done by 2025, but by that time I do expect some production from one or two unannounced factories as well. Shanghai actually only took 10 months from start of construction to first deliveries, so it is possible in countries with less bureaucracy. In theory Tesla could announce a new factory at Investor Day in March and start production in early 2024 (although I don't expect this).

So in a ""everything goes perfectly"" scenario, 4.8M is a rough estimation of mainly the four existing factories plus maybe some production from 1 or 2 unannounced factories.

Again though, both the bull and bear numbers are numbers I expect to be extremely unlikely (maybe 5% chance each).",1513,True,1675441424.0,2023-02-03 17:23:44,5,0,Ehralur,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10sk1gh/on_teslas_valuation_part_4/j72g4n5/,True,,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,j72g4n5

It would be nice if Tesla figured out a 'rental car mode' for the Tesla app that made a temporary connection with the car to restore those features, but didn't mess with the link between your app and any other Tesla product that you own.

I would love this.  If it were integrated with the rental company's systems, it could even automatically enable when you receive the rental and disassociate when you've completed the rental.

comment,12hn48z,12hn48z,,"I've got the same car but with the 19"" wheels and FSD.  After backing out the tax credits it was $52k. Tesla's are cheap used these days so looks like I could get $36k for it roughly assuming FSD doesn't bump the price a bit.  I've saved about $8k on electricity because the EV plan lowered our overall bill $2k/year.  However, ignoring that and just assuming no electricity savings.

* Miles 57k
* Car cost $52k - $36k = $16k in depreciation or $4k/year
* Electricity costs = $1000.  Again, really negative but this would be mostly SuperCharging and another 50k miles @0.015/kWh.
* Insurance $5k
* Taxes (most are included in purchase price) $1k
* Tires - $1100
* Other Maintenance $32

That is $24k TCO for 4 years or about $6k/year or $0.42/mile.  I bought a gas SUV about 6 months prior to the Tesla and it has cost me $12k/year and about $32k TCO or about $8k/year or $1.50/mile.

I'll grab this comment I saw where this article was posted elsewhere: https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/145yswc/17_fatalities_736_crashes_the_shocking_toll_of/jno4bms/

> Using the average of 1.37 deaths per 100M miles traveled, 17 deaths would need to be on more than 1.24B miles driven in autopilot. (Neglecting different fatality rates in different types of driving, highway, local, etc) The fsd beta has 150M miles alone as of a couple of months ago, so including autopilot for highways, a number over 1.24B seems entirely reasonable. But we'd need more transparency and information from Tesla to make sure.

comment,1464r0f,1464r0f,,"From a statistical point of view, there are two questions that one should ask about things like this:

1. How many accidents would have occurred on all of the drives in which FSD (or whatever) was in use if those same people on those same drives had not been using FSD?
2. Whether #1 is more of less, how severe would those accidents have been relative to the ones that happened with the automated driving aids?

Unfortunately, both are essentially unanswerable in a direct sense, but one can compare accident rates between cars without FSD (or whatever) and those with, over tens of thousands of drivers and millions of miles and draw conclusions.  I don't know what those conclusions are, but THAT is what's interesting.  Expecting FSD (or whatever) to be perfect is ludicrous.  It just has to be better than humans.

This is important for some to be able to confirm they have HW4 on their new Model Ys as a deciding factor of whether to accept delivery or not (not possible in every region, nor honestly advisable).

Manufacturers intentionally make headliners beige in most economy cars and crossovers because it makes them look *significantly* bigger inside and also why a lot of premium sports coupes (my C8 for instance) have black linings becsuse it accentuates that cockpit feel. Selling point for crossovers is the idea of size but economical and a sports car you'd want to relate to a performance machine/fighter jet and that feeling of confinement is synonymous with excitement and speed/rigidity. One of the most cost-effective marketing ploys in the automotive market.

comment,14x44f2,14x44f2,,"Matt Levine writes:

> The technical problem is that index funds are mutual funds, and there are Securities and Exchange Commission and Internal Revenue Service rules that encourage mutual funds to be “diversified,” and “diversified” in those rules means something like “not having too much of their money in their biggest holdings.” Roughly speaking, a diversified mutual fund has to have at least 50% of its money in holdings that are each smaller than 5% of its portfolio. If you just invested in the Nasdaq 100 index, your top five holdings would each represent more than 5% of your portfolio, and they would add to about 45.9% of your portfolio. Which is uncomfortably close to 50%. If the top five stocks got a little bigger relative to the rest of the index, or if Tesla and Meta got a little bigger and crossed the 5% threshold, then you’d go over 50% in concentrated holdings and no longer be diversified under the rules, and that would be bad.

And Bloomberg writes:

> In one scenario, the document says, weights can be pared back if the combined influence of the largest companies — those making up 4.5% or more of the gauge — adds up to more than 48%…. Data compiled by Bloomberg show that was the case on July 3, when six companies — Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet Inc., Nvidia Corp., Amazon.com Inc., and Tesla Inc. — saw their combined weight reach 50.9%.

The others know that Tesla requires you to have the hands on the wheel, so they amp up how you don't need your hands on their wheels.

Looks like their marketing worked on you.

The steering wheel nag is largely there because back in 2016 someone got decapitated for not paying attention.

Model S/X vehicles made before the 2021 refresh will *always* need the steering wheel nags because they have no cabin cameras. Was one of the things I *loved* about my 2017 Model X was that I could stare at my phone for a while drive, and as long as I touched the wheel now and then, I was good.

Newer cars all have a cabin camera in them, and I imagine they're just trying to make sure that the camera is able to account for most scenarios, which I think it does.

They have reduced the frequency of the nags, which is nice, however, it is still required for now.

Also keep in mind that there's bunches of videos out there showing that, despite their systems being ""true hands free"" systems, there are scenarios where it DOES ask you to put your hands on the wheel, like BlueClues ensuring your hands are on the wheel through turns and such.

I'd recommend you Google up some review from people who have used the alternative systems so you get an idea as to what it's *really* like before you buy into the marketing spin that the legacy OEMs are doing.",1382,False,1690369973.0,2023-07-26 13:12:53,10,0,Nakatomi2010,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/15a2mjs/fsd/jtiar1a/,True,,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,jtiar1a

* Tesla uses deceptive and heavy handed tactics to try and thwart these service complaints.  They trick customers, cancel their appointments, put flags in the software to block that customer or hide true problems with the vehicle.
* A special Tesla team in Nevada ruthlessly suppresses and stonewalls customer complaints, and celebrates each major deflection of a customer by hitting a musical gong/xylophone.
* Indpendent experts have found varying degrees of inaccuracy or exaggeration in Teslas range claims, far more than any other automaker.
* EPA processes and rules make it hard to hold them accountable.
* Korea is the only place that has really made them accountable, forcing Tesla and Musk himself to make a public admission of their deceitful conduct.
* Some owners and drivers don't understand the things that can affect range, such as driving style and conditions and weather, and use of heating or air conditioning.

Looking it up now, it looks like Musk bought in after the roadster was designed and the initial prototype built, but Musk, essentially, brought it to production with his capital.

The wiki insists Musk made design choices and mandated the carbon fiber chasis, but no mention of any engineering contributions / production designs.

>Tesla wasn't even remotely established when Musk was made CEO. They didn't even have a prototype, and were planning to use a cheap off the shelf propulsion system. They were essentially vaporware.

This is, imo, a pedantic splitting of hairs. It is true that Tesla would not have become the company it is now without Elon's money or marketing skills. 

But he also does not seem to have provided any engineering input, so it is disingenuous to imply that he was involved in changing the company's product from Vaporware to ""well-designed vehicle""

My immediate reactions are the obvious ones: Why replace such a new car? Why replace a truck with a SUV?

But putting those aside, to address your specific topics:

* IMO, ride quality of the Model X is good, but not as smooth as a high-end luxury vehicle. I keep mine in Sport/Plaid configuration for everything, but frankly the ""comfort"" mode doesn't seem that much different.
* Noise level on the highway seems good, but not as quiet as some other vehicles I've driven. For both ride quality and noise level, the short answer is: better than the Tesla 3 and Y, but not as refined as, say a Mercedes.
* I personally strongly prefer the Tesla nav and UI over CarPlay. While I find CarPlay a life-saving crutch when dealing with inferior infotainment systems from the likes of Stallantis or Toyota, it's really just ""acceptable"" where most OEM software is ""completely unacceptable."" CarPlay is slow (even when wired and on a fast phone, it's the timing of animations, not the smoothness), cartoony, and has pretty bad UX design overall.
* Seat comfort is great, IMO. Nice side bolstering and synthetic seat material.
* Cabin size is good. Plenty of room inside.
* I use FSD Beta, so I can't comment on Enhanced Autopilot.
* Other stuff: The performance is thoroughly insane and fun; it never gets old.

So the value IMO is that you can just hit the blinker and it’ll change lanes when you tell it to. This works well in low density, high speed traffic, with minimal-moderate speed difference between lanes. 

I’m not saying this has no value but changing lanes the old fashioned way isn’t much extra effort. You already need to check for other cars, blind spots in either case. So it’s really just the added effort of turning the wheel and then re-enabling auto steer (double tap on shifter). Pretty minimal IMO. I’d personally pay maybe $1000 for the feature on a new car.

comment,171qtir,171qtir,,"Congratulations on your new Xpeng G9! It's undoubtedly a good-looking car and represents the significant advancements in electric vehicle technology coming out of China.  
However, when it comes to Chinese cars, I do have some reservations. Supporting the regime is one thing, and I have some paranoia on privacy with the car being full of mics and apps. I mean, [if Tesla is listening/looking...](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-workers-shared-sensitive-images-recorded-by-customer-cars-2023-04-06/) Another concern is the availability of parts outside of China. Depending on where you're located, sourcing replacements can be a challenge, potentially leaving your car unusable for extended periods should something break or fail. I heard of BYD and Hongqi owners who's been waiting for months for a new tail light or charging ports.  
Furthermore, payload capacity is another factor to consider as mentioned by a fellow norwegian in this thread. Many vehicles from the region tend to offer lower payload limits. The G9 is rated just over 300 kg, which is ridiculous in a car this size.

It's not for us. It's not for people with taste or restraint. It's for people who are so extroverted they look at a nuclear waste green G-wagon and think... no, this isn't shouty enough. I need something even less practical and I need more people to look at me. It's like the bikers in south park episode. ""maybe if we're louder more people will look at us!"" And the Cybertruck is exactly that, exactly for people like that. 

It's a great marketing exercise for Tesla, I'll give them that. But I dunno - I thought we tried this whole stainless steel thing with the Delorean and it didn't work out that well. Looks great when it's new, but 5 minutes in the dust and it looks shit. Same as piano black plastic frankly. And as far as I can tell, it doesn't have any of the equipment truck truck people want - so at the end of the day it's just a unnecessarily huge car that you can't park anywhere because it's so big and the range is gonna suck because it's 2000lb and several points of aero worse than a normal car.

A tail light system that has *fewer* sections lit up during braking does not conflict with federal standards. That seems like an oversight.

>The issue here is that less of the Cybertruck's rear lighting is solely dedicated to brake lights than to the taillights or turn signals, the former of which deactivate during braking. **Although the lights at the edges become more intense under braking, their small surface area means that overall, the Cybertruck emits less light when it's slowing down.**

comment,17mj9vb,17mj9vb,,"Not using LiDAR, when every other higher rated self-driving car does, is not smart.

Self driving is largely only possible with cameras/software for virtual AND physical sensors like LiDAR. Tesla removed RADAR even but that is more problematic than LiDAR, both are better than just computer vision for virtual object detection.

If they used LiDAR they could detect stationary objects. This would have been no problem for LiDAR 300+ yards out.

Computer vision will always be able to be fooled by 2d vision without physical 3d checks.

Tesla's don't have physical depth checking. They are trying to do everything with computer vision that is affected by weather, light, debris, dirt, and unknowns in their detection. It is why their lead AI guy left, it is an impossible feat without physical depth checking (LiDAR).

Tesla plans to start deliveries of the Cybertruck electric pickup on Nov. 30 and has started telegraphing that volumes will be limited, meaning early owners will likely be able to make a profit by reselling the highly anticipated vehicle.

To help prevent this, Tesla on Monday added a paragraph relating specifically to the Cybertruck in the terms and conditions section of the sales agreement buyers need to sign when purchasing a vehicle from the company, which stated that the buyer agrees to not resell the electric truck for at least one year after taking delivery, or face some consequences, including potentially a lawsuit.

comment,184oplo,184oplo,,"“They deliver components to Tesla’s factory in Berlin, and if this causes disruption to them we hope to force them back to the negotiation table,” said IF Metall negotiation secretary Veli-Pekka Saikkala, adding Hydro Extrusions was the only supplier of the components in Europe.

IF Metall, Sweden’s biggest manufacturing union, is locked in a fight with Tesla to get a collective bargaining agreement for its 130 mechanics in Sweden. Metall put the mechanics on strike on Oct. 27, refusing to service Tesla’s cars.

Since then, the mechanics have been joined by members of other unions such as postal workers, dockworkers, cleaners and others who refuse to work with Tesla or its products.

Saikkala said the union was prepared to ramp up the conflict if Tesla refused to sign.

             “This fight is very, very important. It’s so important that we cannot let it go. It’s important for us but also for the 
               whole Swedish labour market,” he said.

We don’t have any minimum wages or laws for when you can and cannot work in Sweden. We have frameworks and employment protection, but apart from that, it is collective bargaining agreements that regulate the labour market,” said Torbjorn Johansson, negotiation secretary at LO, the union umbrella organization.

                  Around 90% of all employees in Sweden are covered by collective bargaining agreements, which regulates wages,

“Projects of the organization include Right on Crime, which is focused on criminal justice reform,[4] and Fueling Freedom, which seeks to ""explain the forgotten moral case for fossil fuels""[5] by rejecting the scientific consensus on climate change.[6]”

“Donors to the organization include energy companies Chevron, ExxonMobil, and other fossil fuel interests.”

People are talking shit on EVs non stop. The amount of times I've seen people call Teslas and other EVS shitboxes (there's a guy like 3 comments down saying this) that break non stop and cant even hit 100k miles, or think they burn a house down or catch fire while driving, or they think they only get 180 miles and have to charge for 45 mins before going another 180  is insane. The amount of misinformation is crazy. 

Btw, the mods left that article up and just attached the ""misleading"" tag to it, so you can see where they stand.

Today I could sell my MYP for about $50K.  A very modest depreciation over 18 months.  And the original MYLR actually “appreciated” due to the demand and price spike.  

You simply bought a car at the very top of the COVID pump.  And now you’re trying to sell it at the end of the sales year when Tesla is dropping prices to make their end of year numbers.  

Lots of other cars are seeing a much worse issue because dealers were adding $20-30K to the price of their cars above MSRP.  And now they have a huge glut of inventory.

Does the weird coefficient of drag comparison, comparing the truck to a super car, acting like it’s amazing. Cd factors in frontal cross section, meaning that two similarly shaped objects, one small and one large, would have the same Cd. A supercar usually has some downforce, ~~dropping~~ raising its Cd.

comment,18btp61,18btp61,,"“ — 
Danish dockworkers and drivers are threatening to stop transporting Teslas to neighboring Sweden if the carmaker does not reach a deal with striking Swedish workers within two weeks.

Denmark’s 3F labor union said the planned “sympathy strike” is aimed at putting extra pressure on a Tesla (TSLA) subsidiary to recognize Swedish labor union IF Metall, which would enable collective bargaining over wages and other terms of employment.

It is the first time a labor union outside of Sweden has threatened industrial action against Tesla in solidarity with the Swedish workers.

                This is about good wages, good pensions and good insurance for all our members who work at Tesla,” IF Metall said on its website.
                We have been negotiating with Tesla for a long time.     They have refused to sign a collective agreement and 
                 violate basic principles in the Swedish labor market.”

On Tuesday, the spokesperson for Denmark’s 3F, said its dockworkers and drivers would not handle Teslas destined for Sweden, referring to “speculation” that the carmaker would try to circumvent the Swedish port blockade by shipping its vehicles to Danish ports for onward delivery via truck.

Such a workaround “is no longer possible,” the union spokesperson said.",1800,True,1701830467.0,2023-12-06 03:41:07,4,0,BikkaZz,business,https://reddit.com/r/business/comments/18btp61/teslas_clash_with_swedish_workers_risks_spilling/kc6e9me/,True,,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,kc6e9me

comment,18hqkxn,18hqkxn,,"WASHINGTON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) is recalling over 2 million vehicles in the U.S. to install new safeguards in its Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system, after a federal safety regulator cited safety concerns.

The largest-ever Tesla recall appears to cover nearly all vehicles on U.S. roads to better ensure drivers pay attention when using the system. Tesla's recall filing said that Autopilot's software system controls ""may not be sufficient to prevent driver misuse"" and could increase the risk of a crash.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has spent over two years investigating whether vehicles produced by the electric automaker led by billionaire Elon Musk adequately ensure drivers pay attention.

Acting NHTSA Administrator Ann Carlson praised Tesla for agreeing to the recall. ""One of the things we determined is that drivers are not always paying attention when that system is on,"" she said at a U.S. House hearing.

Carlson said the agency opened a safety probe in August 2021 when she kept hearing about fatal crashes involving use of Autopilot. ""My immediate response was, 'We have to do something about this,'"" she said.

Separately, Transport Canada said Tesla will recall 193,000 vehicles to address the Autopilot issue.

I don't think that's true? The first I saw was on roads around their office, with a guy in the seat not touching the wheel, with obviously a dev build and a common environment. Considering how far the tech was even back then, I'd think staging it would have been more work than to just let the system work.


> still not producing any really impressive results

What. FSD is the way ahead of anyone else. They are the only ones actually trying to make autonomous driving work on _all_ roads with a generalist approach. They have proven this is a very hard problem but they have also proven they're ahead others solving it. A competitor would need the equal of the FSD chip to avoid lugging around 3-10 GPUs worth of cargo taking multiple kW's. This is also a good part of the reason I invested in TSLA before they blew up after Autonomy Day as I saw how they were ahead, and nothing has really proven that point untrue, just that they were optimistic in the scale of the challenge this kind of tech has against infinitely unique real life RNG.

About FSD fitting the robot, Tesla has pointed out the work they are doing translates very well to Optimus. It would be a bit silly to even have it otherwise.

While I agree with most of your points, the biggest issue I have with Rivian is that it has little prospects of getting popular outside of US. 

China has extremely competitive EV market, US cars rarely get popular in Europe, and other markets mostly aren't wealthy enough for Rivian's sales to thrive. Tesla, with its massive brand recognition, has much better chances of competing at European/Chinese markets as ""the premium foreign car automaker"". 

And while being established number 2.

comment,1c7y80h,1c7y80h,,"By Brian Barrett

Tesla’s Cybertruck has been widely derided. Its panel gaps are wide and amateurish, it’s prone to rust, and it looks like an ergonomic cheese grater. Its most serious flaw to date, though, has resulted in a recall of nearly 4,000 vehicles.

The US National Highway Traffic Safety Association has recalled 3,878 Cybertrucks, which comprises any that were manufactured between November 13 of last year and April 4. At issue is the accelerator pedal: Its pad can become dislodged, resulting in the pedal becoming trapped in the trim above it. This is, needless to say, quite bad.

There is slighty  more rainfall than in Sanfrancisco, and much more than in Nevada, where water usage from other Tesla factories was never front page news. Also, we have a lot of car factories in Spain here in Europe, and I never heard water usage was a big issue. Generally, agriculture is the biggest usage of water, and other usages are second order.

There's no new information here, aside from a *significant* amount of B-roll footage people plugging in J1772 chargers, while trying to pass it off on the viewers as being CCS chargers being plugged in.

Additionally, there's a lot of clever editing to try and ""Get to the point"" and paints a *slightly* different picture, like that one lady saying ""I'll probably get a Mercedes next"", etc, etc.

The reality is that we don't know what's up.

If less EVs are being sold, then we need less chargers, but that doesn't mean you nuke the team, then re-hire some of them back.

I maintain that Rebecca Tinucci was asked to nuke some staff and said ""No"", so Elon nuked them.

I also firmly believe that there's a desire to encourage 3rd party companies to pick up the slack.  There's no other EV manufacturer out there that maintains their own charging network, and now that Tesla's connector has won, and all the competitors are onboard with building NACS connectors in North America, it makes sense that 3rd parties fill in the gaps.

That said, we *really* need 3rd party chargers available on the navigation in North America, similar to what's in Europe.",1305,False,1715646814.0,2024-05-14 02:33:34,26,0,Nakatomi2010,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1crd1g3/whats_next_for_tesla_superchargers_after_elon/l3xlq1x/,True,,2024,both,search,False,False,0,l3xlq1x

No rational executive blindsides an entire industry while simultaneously exiting 100% of the talent who built a profitable, strategic business that dominates the industry, and is positioned to dominate it for the foreseeable future. There are hundreds of ways Elon could have gotten the “hard core” headcount reductions he wanted without making a rash move like this. 

Even if he felt Tinucci had to go, firing the entire team was a destructive move, and a terrible way to make a point if you want any sort of corporate culture other than fear. The cumulative experience of those 500 people who built the Supercharger business was an unimaginably valuable asset to Tesla.

Elon has historically talked about the Tesla talent magnet and urged engineers who want to solve big problems to come work there. So this move sends what message to that talent? 

Ultimately I do think Elon has done the industry (but not Tesla) a rather large favor. He has just made available hundreds of heavy-hitters who can help every other charging network out there get their collective acts together and start executing as well as Tesla has.

In a video shared with WIRED, researchers at the Beijing-based automotive cybersecurity firm GoGoByte demonstrated that they could carry out a relay attack against the latest Tesla Model 3 despite its upgrade to an ultra-wideband keyless entry system, instantly unlocking it with less than a hundred dollars worth of radio equipment. Since the Tesla 3's keyless entry system also controls the car's immobilizer feature designed to prevent its theft, that means a radio hacker could start the car and drive it away in seconds—unless the driver has enabled Tesla's optional, off-by-default PIN-to-drive feature that requires the owner to enter a four-digit code before starting the car.

---------------------

@elonmusk has been the key driver of AI and autonomy at Tesla. He has always pushed us to achieve great things, even when such ideas were seemingly impossible at the time. Some examples:

Back in 2014, Autopilot started on a ridiculously tiny computer that only had ~384 KB of memory and puny compute (didn't even have native floating point arithmetic). He asked the engineering team to implement lane keeping, lane changing, longitudinal control for vehicles, curvature, etc. Many, even in the team, thought that the request was crazy. Nonetheless, he never gave up and pushed the team to achieve this very difficult goal. In 2015, beyond all odds, Tesla shipped the world's first Autopilot system. The second closest such product only came to market many years later.

In 2016, Tesla started doing all of the computer vision required for Autopilot in-house instead of depending on external vendors. Many people thought it was insane to bet the product on developing the vision system from scratch within a few months, which had taken other companies a decade or more. Yet, we achieved this target within eleven months. This was a strategically important move that started the development of a strong AI team at Tesla.

Not only did he push for strong AI software, but also for powerful AI hardware. Tesla, which others thought was just a car company, was making custom silicon to run neural networks efficiently.",3884,True,1717933621.0,2024-06-09 13:47:01,85,0,twinbee,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/1dbrv8e/tesla_aiap_software_head_ashok_elluswamy_comments/l7swqe0/,True,,2024,both,search,False,False,0,l7swqe0

AutoSteer is Lane Centering.

When AutoPilot is disabled, it is essentially removing the ability to use AutoSteer. You should still be able to use TACC while suspended from AutoPilot.

comment,1ekp49r,1ekp49r,,"this article reads like last year's news.

missing Dojo is a server/CPU - the datacenter has x2 AI4 chips for every 1 Nvida H100 - this is a big deal. No one else has AI4 (new HW4 name of Tesla made chip)

No talk on if there are more servers.

No talk about how much power/compute the datacenter has.

No talk on how long to setup things before it is running at 100%

The article hints - but to not state - no only for fsd, also for Optimus robot.

as well Tesla's AI chip is in every car they have made and are making. So 7 million data sources to get more training data - and that number is growing by millions / year. As well - every car collects and sends only revelent data to back to Tesla - even if you do not have FSD.

To expand on above - only revelent data is sent back to base. So each Tesla computes the data in car then sends only smaller chunks back. So no overload of data.

Then - vs the next self driving car that does not function without a human at a computer to help out every 2-5 miles. only collecting data from 1000's of cars at a cost that is something like 200k for the hardware vs the 2k for Tesla.

Ford and Rivian can use superchargers right now, they just require an adapter. 2025 is when manufacturers will first start transitioning to having a native NACS port.

comment,1g3tg8k,1g3tg8k,,"From the article:

>his latest Model 3 uses acoustic glass all around, and combined with other sound-suppressing measures, achieves a 70-mph cruising sound level of 67 decibels—only one decibel higher than a Mercedes EQS450 that costs more than twice as much—and a dramatic three decibels quieter than the last Model 3 we tested.

While 3 dB is a huge improvement in cabin noise (decibel is logarithmic, not linear), it's actually surprising how loud the Mercedes is. My i4 got 64dB from the [same C&D test](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a40743000/2022-bmw-i4-edrive40-by-the-numbers/), and the BMW iX got [63 dB](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a39983612/2022-bmw-ix-tested-interior-sound-highway-range/).

> The 363-mile EPA range translates into 310 miles in our 75-mph highway-range test, which is an impressive gain from earlier Model 3s. 

75mph with 300 miles+ range is seriously impressive for this segment. My old Model 3 could barely hit 250 under the same condition. This in combination with the Supercharger network would make a lot of long distance trips much more viable than with other EVs.

> Other than its great ride and quiet cabin, the most impressive thing about this latest Model 3 is the price. The base sticker for this rear-drive long-range model is $44,130.

comment,1g6pg7k,1g6pg7k,,"Tesla is still overpriced. That has been the case for a long time now. Tesla isn’t traded based on fundamentals but more as a bet on the future. However, when it comes to autonomous driving, for example, they are far behind the competition (see Google subsidiary Waymo, which already conducts 100,000 rides per week and thus has a competitive advantage, while actively collecting data). You only need to look at the visual difference between a Waymo autonomous car and Tesla’s Robotaxi. Autonomous cars must function under extreme conditions, such as complex traffic scenarios and bad weather — this requires expensive technology and data processing. It’s hard to believe that this could be available for $30,000. Anyone stepping into an autonomous vehicle must trust that it will get them safely to their destination and the Robotaxi doesn’t look trustworthy at all.

At the Robotaxi event, expectations were very high, but it was marked by theatrics and did not convince many people, leaving a lot of questions. For example, the remote control of the door opener and the Robotaxi driving off as Elon Musk got in, or robots that were being controlled by people behind the scenes. Generally, it was unclear what was real and what was part of the show — and the Hollywood location didn’t exactly help either.

If you only include the 60k superchargers around the world and exclude everything else? It's \~$1,250 a month in profit each to cover the $250m. It's a lot, but if someone told me they make $1,250 a month per stall? I don't think i'd flinch.

My previous car was a 1.2L 3 cylinder turbo automatic (Opel Mokka 2021) that was absolute shit to drive but very decent to use. I had some buttons for climate control, I had android auto, I had a decent steering wheel (buttons wise), a remote with actual buttons, working keyless entry, etc.

Now in the Volvo it's amazing to drive but soooo fucking annoying to interface with. The remote has no buttons and sometimes keyless entry doesn't work and the trunk doesn't have a kick sensor and there's a RFID sensor (tesla like) only on the driver's side door. 

The steering wheel has no Mute or Answer Call buttons. The Volume UP button also works as an OK key so if you have anything on the screen that needs confirmation you can't turn the volume down until you OK / Volume up the notification.

There some many dumb choices like this (some fixable by software, some not) but 99% of the EX30 usability problems could have been solved with a better steering wheel (and a HUD).

Another reason could be pressing the pedal too abruptly so that your acceleration is uncomfortable. Again, being smoother on the pedal helps. A third reason could be the lack of drivetrain noise.

comment,1h4063m,1h4063m,,"Tesla has a P/E rating of almost 100.

That means the company needs to grow 6x to be worth its current valuation.  
Since that will take time and you want return on your investment during that time, it will need to grow much more actually. So say 10x in 15 years. If tesla grows 10x in 15 years that would make it worth its valuation.

Now it MAY actually do that, but it is highly uncertain. Its robotaxis will not be the only ones on the market and they will have to compete both against other robot taxis and against private car ownership and self driving. The home assistance robots may fail entirely. Point is, it is uncertain. So we need to estimate an EV of the range of possible outcomes and then it still needs to be worth its valuation. There is some chance they will go broke, there is some chance they wont grow very much because part of their endeavours prove to be a failure or because some chinese competetor does everything they do but cheaper and yes there is some chance they will sell their robots and robotaxi's to the entire world. Now if that last chance is say 35%, that means in that scenario it wouldn't need to grow 10x but 30x in 15 years.

I hope you are starting to see why it is very hard to justify a P/E100 ratio for any company.

EDIT: Encourage you all to read through the thoughtful replies from others, the case is more nuanced than most people realize. I’m not sure of the true correct answer without reading much deeper into it, but I hope the result is determined based on true legal merit rather than political opinions. 

If there is legal basis for the claims that he unfairly created this compensation package deal  - then the deal should be canceled (regardless of the shareholder vote, it’s important to protect minority shareholders as well that’s the responsibility of the law).

comment,1h57lw9,1h57lw9,,"The ruling was that it was a breach of fiduciary duty, that the board was too heavily influenced by Musk because he has ties to many of them.

That  shareholders voted in favor twice is irrelevant to the judge's ruling. To quote [someone else](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1h57lw9/comment/m04txxe/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in this thread:

>because delaware protects the rights of \*minority shareholders.\* whether  or not the majority approve of it is part of the issue, but it's not  the entirety. a guy with just 1 share has standing to contest a deal  that is unfair to him under the law, even if he is the only one that is  against it.

Bottom line: he has ties to many of the board members, who would of  course approve a package to be voted on in favor of their friend, particularly given it was ~~crazy goals no one thought he would hit~~ expected goals the board did expect him to hit, and 1 shareholder thought this pay package was insane and filed a lawsuit.

>That leaves TSMC and its upcoming investment at 2nm and 16A, which is a challenge for ASML for three reasons. First, there is the aforementioned shift in TSMC’s model; repurposing equipment likely means fewer lithography orders. Second, while ASML may have a monopoly on advanced lithography, TSMC is poised to have monopsony power in terms of being able to actually make money on processes that utilize ASML’s advanced lithography, which may depress prices (this is the third factor that could help TSMC’s margins). The third challenge is that we are past peak lithography.

comment,1hp84q6,1hp84q6,,"Alright, since some people like to be an asshole instead of answering like a normal human being, here’s my answer based on my personal experience. Buying at an all-time high raises eyebrows for some, but if you’re investing in a company with strong fundamentals, who cares? I don’t worry about MSFT’s price, I invest monthly regardless. There’s a well-known quote: “I don’t buy stocks, I buy companies.” Personally, I’m focused on accumulating shares and adding more to the companies and ETFs I believe in. More shares, bigger returns in the long run. If MSFT drops 20%, that’s a 20% discount on future financial freedom.

Now, if you’re out there chasing hot stocks at an all-time high because of FOMO, well, that’s on you. But if the company is solid, don’t sweat it. Prices fluctuate, sure, but eventually, they tend to climb back and hit new highs.

For those still uncertain, stop banging your head against the wall and stick to ETFs. Companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are solid, wide-moat businesses. Unless some major negative news breaks, there’s no reason to panic about the price.

That said, I’d be cautious with Tesla. It’s a volatile stock, highly sensitive to news, and that unpredictability can lead to some headaches.

It is not uncommon for manufactorers to make their own brand product and sell at a substantial markup as well as making store branded or other products are a fairly deep discount. This helps pay the fixed costs, but doesn't quite make as much profit. Kenmore was a good example of this in appliances and others, where it is branded.

The drop in sales for autos and Tesla specifically, isn't just because Musk is an asshole. It has also been a problem before DOGE. The cost of vehicles has risen so much that it is way out of the realm of many. The sales have slumped heavily. 

You can also combine with Tesla's valuation, which it insane and more than all other auto makers, so it is expected that Tesla stock would need to adjust down to reality at some point.

comment,1jc1389,1jc1389,,"Well, let's see.

According to pretty much all of Reddit, CO2 emissions are going to kill us all.  Even leaving out the more extreme way of framing this, CO2 emissions already kill a lot of people each year.  So EVs are a way to make an immense difference and fairly quickly.

If you follow space news, you might know that we have a few close calls with big space rocks over the next few years.  And there are probably more we do not even know about.  And we have so many neato ways to wipe ourselves out; Putin threatens us with one of them on a daily basis.  So I would think it is a no-brainer that we need to spread out more to prevent a ""one and done"" scenario.  That is such a clear case of saving humanity, I do not know how to engage with someone who does not see it.  It would be like trying to convince someone that the sky is not, as they keep claiming, a brilliant shade of neon brown. (There's a joke within a joke there, if you can find it :) )

There's Starlink which is probably changing more lives for the better right now than any other single project.

Then there is Neuralink.  Despite the more broken people of Reddit's claims, this project is successful and helping people right now go from being completely jailed within their own bodies to being able to interact with the world again.

Today's ketamine addicts and insane politicians don't realize that if they get too greedy, they start to screw over a lot of rich people (e.g., in the in this particular case, millionaire car dealership owners).

Screw over enough commonly rich people, and the wheels of legislation start to turn and eventually run over to the super rich.

While it's fairly inconsequential to be attached to tesla, it would probably be beneficial to recognize the emotional labor you're expending for the sake of a brand. I'm not in a cult, I'm just a normal guy. I own things from multiple brands based on my own personal discernment.

The lefts main argument is that he is an unelected official affecting government policy (ie not confirmed by the senate). These actions are causing government agencies to be shuddered and public funding to be slashed at local communities (ie departments of education, department that funds public libraries, parks and wildlife, etc). 

There are plenty of counter arguments, my first being that there are articles that allow private citizens to give goods and services to government for free (like software and service), which is what Elon is doing, to identify waste and fraud in many agencies. So, essentially they have circumvented Elon being confirmed by the senate. This is good because this allows the government to allow quickly without being bogged down by the swamp of judges, media, and politics. 

I believe if people spent some time listening to other viewpoints and understood the goal of this administration, while also listening to the other side, they would be more inclined to cheer the wins and still be honest enough to point out the short comings (which there have been).

The EV6, on the other hand, is one of the very best at DC fast charging. If these are your choices, insist on an EV6.

Cross-reference the stops in ABRP with the Tesla app (or website) to confirm compatibility. Or if the EV6 is a brand new 2025 model; it has a native NACS port so it can use ""most"" Superchargers without an adapter.

You can DC fast charge at other public chargers like Electrify America, EVGo, Ionna, etc without an adapter. Unless it's that brand new 2025 EV6; then you will probably need a CCS->NACS adapter. Yes, adapters are a way of life with DC fast charging now...

* **Fanuc (FANUY)**: Japanese leader in industrial robotics, especially factory automation.
* **Yaskawa Electric (YASKY)**: Another major Japanese player focused on automation and industrial robots.
* **KUKA**: German robotics company now owned by China's Midea Group, so not directly listed.
* **Rockwell Automation (ROK)**: More focused on automation but includes key robotics components for smart factories.

comment,1ku94ha,1ku94ha,,"Shorting TSLA has been my best investment ever. Here are my tricks.


1) Don't literally short it. Buy ETFs like TSLS, TSLZ, and TSLQ. I prefer the 1x ETFs unless I have extremely high conviction. 


2) Be patient. Really patient. Wait for it to hit overbought areas on the RSI. Don't chase bad days.


3) Take your gains. TSLA always throws out some bullshit eventually so if you are up a decent amount on the day or week just take the win. Do not hold long.


4) Watch the news. Pay attention to macro and micro things that impact the market. If there is an overall bull sentiment, TSLA will go up. Don't fight it. Just wait for it to get overbought. Understand when TSLA sales numbers come out, and when earnings are coming up.


5) Never hold through earnings. At least not your full position. You can trade during ER but don't hold through. TSLA usually sells off slowly ahead of earnings and bad news gets ""priced in"". That's why it bounces back.


6) Pretend like TSLA is in fact a $400 or $500 stock and ignore logic. Everything will make more sense. If it sells off to $200 it will seem like it can go lower (it might), but make your decisions assuming the dumbest and most corrupt rich people in the world think it's a $500 stock.

The final class are v4 supercharger with an embedded adapter. Any EV can use these.

The final group is the only one that you can use.

The charging universe is not only Tesla. EVGo and electrify America have been on the scene for awhile. Lately I've been using Rivian Adventure Network chargers. Start with a tap of a credit card and super fast.

Just look for other chargers too is my advice. Use plugshare.com to search for chargers in the area where you are going.

comment,1kx5c3a,1kx5c3a,,">""In China, we see intense competition and Tesla is no longer seen as the technology leader.""

I think this is the real kicker here. 

While the sales decline worldwide (especially in the US) has *some* to do with Elon's salute and his time at Doge,  I think other factors have contributed much more to it. Tesla's sales have been shrinking for the past two years.

A very limited and aging lineup, 3/5 of which are out of the reach of the average person has played a big role. More people want SUVs over sedans, so Tesla is effectively competing with just one model. I don't think the refresh was significant enough for people to want to upgrade.

I too believe that nobody thinks of them as the technology leader anymore which is why the competition has been able to gain a foothold. 

Their tech is still better than the competition in North America in the sense that everything just works and works seamlessly, lag free, but I don't think that's gonna cut it anymore. Model Y is still the highest selling EV in most places but I doubt it'll be for long.",1057,False,1748402118.0,2025-05-28 05:15:18,31,0,ChickenFlavoredCake,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kx5c3a/byd_xiaomi_overtake_tesla_as_top_ev_brand_choices/mumxrsr/,True,,2025,both,search,False,False,0,mumxrsr

* Your dad:
   * Intends to buy a used Tesla, 
   * Qualifies for the used EV tax credit,

Your question is, ""Will putting your name and your brother's name on the loan and (I presume) any title documents cause any problems with your dad getting the tax credit?"" 

Answer: probably not.  

As far as the IRS is concerned, it seems as though only the person the dealer reports to the IRS as the buyer needs to qualify for the used tax credit.  The IRS doesn't exactly say this, but here are the clues:

In [IRS FS-2024-26, page 4, A11](https://www.irs.gov/pub/taxpros/fs-2024-26.pdf#page=4), the IRS mentioned multiple people getting the *new* EV tax credit:

>The name and taxpayer identification number of the owner claiming the New Clean Vehicle Credit should be listed on the seller’s report. See Topic B, FAQ 9. Accordingly, multiple owners of a new clean vehicle should inform the seller which owner will claim the New Clean Vehicle Credit so that the seller can identify that taxpayer on the seller’s report. **The credit would be allowed only on the tax return of the owner listed in the seller’s report.",3559,True,1748482402.0,2025-05-29 03:33:22,3,0,SirMontego,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kxxgm4/cosign_on_used_ev_credit/mut2xr0/,True,,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,mut2xr0

comment,1kxu7oq,1kxu7oq,,"I do think we have to address the budget buyer use case too. The used market for EV is strong and getting stronger, as EV owners turn over to their 2nd (or 3rd) EV purchases. 

Used 1st(ish) generation EVs are getting quite affordable. Obviously check the model or brand specific subreddit for common issues, but a used EV is a great value, even with nominal battery degradation. 

As an example, I was shopping for a new commuter car and I wanted an EV. I wanted a small, efficient EV that didn’t look ridiculous. I also didn’t want to spend $25k - $50k for a new car that would depreciate as soon as I signed the paperwork. 

I didn’t need a lot of range, since it’s going back and forth to work and around town. Automated driving was a low priority, because I actually like to drive, though some enhanced safety features are fine. Similarly, have the ability to use DCFC in a pinch was good, but I didn’t need huge max DC speed. 

After looking at leafs, ford focus EVs, miniEVs, and others, I zeroed in on the e-Golf. The 2017-20 versions have DCFC and a “larger” battery that gets over 125mi in EPA and real-life driving in good weather. Some also have heat pumps for HVAC that help mitigate winter losses, though at the cost of a potential failure point. 

I was able to grab one used with less than 30k miles for under $20k and it’s a blast to drive.

That happed almost three years ago, though, so maybe someone who recently has been hit but didn't know they were hit but later saw they were hit will come along and share their experience with you.

Also, have you taken into consideration that you may have been cursed...?",678,False,1748552383.0,2025-05-29 22:59:43,1,0,just_a_juanita,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kyl4rv/question_about_tesla_cars/muyc0cw/,True,,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,muyc0cw

>He can get in discussions about flying a satellite and whether we can make the right orbit and deliver Dragon at the same time and solve all these equations in real time. It’s amazing to watch the amount of knowledge he has accumulated over the years.
