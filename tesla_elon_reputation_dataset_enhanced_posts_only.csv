Actually, it was the news that started calling it a Death Ray and it really annoyed Tesla, because it wasn't a Ray. It was a charged particle beam weapon.  
  
The series is going to cover that time in the late 1930's when Tesla was writing multiple leaders of the nations heading to World War II, saying his particle beam weapon could prevent the war. He offered to travel to the countries and would build the defense system in their country. He was in negotiations with Neville Chamberlain until Chamberlain suddenly cut off all correspondence with him. After that Tesla got an offer from Russia and did travel there, doing something. This series is saying Tesla had a network of laboratories across Europe and they are going to be excavating them.  
  
While Tesla was 83 and frail, he wasn't ill and showed no signs of illness when he was last seen by the hotel staff. There was some suspicion at the time of his death that he was murdered.  
  
They are showing documents that were never published, possibly in Croatia. The engineer is going to try to build the particle beam weapon from Tesla's description in his letters.

post,9p819m,,Tesla Model X 1000 mile road-trip report,"I thought I’d write a review of a Tesla Model X for the sub from the perspective of a V8 loving petrolhead. There’s a lot of hate on here, and even more misinformation, so I thought I’d give the car a chance. 

I’ve just spent 5 days with a 75D and done over 1000 miles. The car was a 2016 with Gen 1 Autonomous tech, 68,000 miles on the clock, and a 200 mile range battery. 

My last big drive was in a 3.0D Range Rover Velar, and the road-trip car before that was a Merc C63 AMG V8 Bi-turbo. I’ve owned 15+ cars, many over 400bhp, and driven dozens more in Europe, UAE and the US. 

The car was booked through Turo. This was for a road-trip from Vegas to San Diego and back, so some days I was doing around 350 miles. Other days I started in the city center of SD and then drove to attractions in and outside the city. I covered all kinds of roads, but the vast majority were freeway and city driving. 

Originally I’d booked a BMW i8 to do the trip, but the car was apparently totaled two days before my booking, so the Model X was a last-minute alternative. I’m aware of how unreliable Turo bookings can be, so I had my eyes on a Tesla as a replacement in case of issues. 

---

**First the bad.** 

This car has a massive blind spot. Within 10 minutes of being in the car I was blasted with horn as I nearly wiped out some poor fucker in a SUV. It seems this blind spot exists when in Autopilot too, as it sometimes happened when the car was autonomously changing lanes. 

There’s a wonderful driver’s display that shows the car in relation to the lanes, the cars, trucks, and bikes around it. But the icons of passing cars only appear once they are a car-length in front of the Tesla. With the blind spot issue, it would be super duper useful if this showed cars beside the Model X! 

Anyway, I quickly came to respect the danger, and learned to not trust the mirrors or autopilot.",11257,True,1539858681.0,2018-10-18 12:31:21,6650,1560,[deleted],cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/9p819m/tesla_model_x_1000_mile_roadtrip_report/,True,0.91,2018,tesla,top,False,False,0,

post,c0i66t,,Reading between the lines: What Slack didn’t disclose in its IPO filing," Slack Technologies, the developer of the popular namesake team collaboration messaging app, recently [applied](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019004786/slacks-1.htm#sA031AD7407DEE4C9AD8C567D8A577EE8) for a public offering on the stock market. This is not a classic IPO, but a “direct listing,” also known a “direct public offering.” This means Slack is not raising money by directly selling shares and instead allows early investors and employees to sell their shares in the public offering. Music streaming service Spotify held a successful direct listing last year.

This story caught my attention for a simple reason. In August 2016, I joined the team developing a still-undercover product called Workplace by Facebook—a direct competitor to Slack. I worked on the product for 2.5 years. Back then, I dreamed of having an opportunity to look inside Slack’s business metrics.

It may seem that Slack has revealed a lot of data about the business in their [S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019004786/slacks-1.htm#sA031AD7407DEE4C9AD8C567D8A577EE8), a document that is almost 200 pages in length.

The reality is, they haven’t. The company had already disclosed in various ways much of the information compiled in their report.

But if we combine the data disclosed in S-1 filing and the experience I gained while working on Slack’s competitor, we’ll be able to uncover interesting details that will paint a more holistic picture.

I must say that this article contains my personal thoughts on the matter, jotted down while going through their S-1 filing, and should not be considered as investment advice.

post,gbmxxr,,Musk tweet knocks $14bn off Tesla market value,"Article: https://www.ft.com/content/90eca82e-498e-4145-91a7-6b19cfe49170

> Elon Musk tweeted a complaint about Tesla’s share price that wiped $14bn off the company’s stock market value on Friday morning.

	Tesla did not immediately confirm whether Mr Musk’s tweet had been given legal clearance, and did not respond to a question about whether the company currently has a general counsel. Tesla lost three general counsels last year, one of them quitting after only two months.


	The Tesla boss, who has 33m followers on Twitter, issued his curt verdict on his company’s shares early in the morning in California on Friday, writing: “Tesla stock price is too high imo.”

Within moments the Tesla share price started sinking, dropping 10 per cent over the course of an hour before recovering slightly. The sharp move comes in what has been a hugely volatile period for Tesla’s shares. They slumped more than 60 per cent after coronavirus hit, but then rebounded by 120 per cent.

People are comparing them to pets.com, but I don’t think even that company was this blatant at ripping investors off. Their “quarterly report” might as well have been a fat middle finger to both their investors and the SEC.

Oh btw the company is worth around $15B... and some analysts are saying it’s a “buying opportunity” given today’s dip.

**Edit**: for more context on the Pets.com comparison:

Pets.com had annual revenue of $619k for first year, and reached a market cap of $400M at its highest. Crazy bubble right?

Well Nikola has annual revenue of less than $100k (maybe a bit more depends on how many more solar panels the CEO is gonna order for his houses lmao), but reached market cap of $30B at its highest.

It’s literally 500 times more overvalued than the most infamous bubble stock during the dotcom crisis.

**Edit 2**: For the people who argue how revenue doesn't matter because they are the next Tesla.

For comparison. Tesla was founded in 2003 and 5 years later the original Tesla Roadster was on sale. They didn't go IPO until 2 years after that. Elon Musk also had a decent track record, being a co-founder and CEO of this small startup called PayPal.

Meanwhile Nikola Motors was founded in 2004, by a businessman with no real education whose resume is ""fluffy"" at best, and their six years of ""industry leading product development"" has yielded some fantastic CG renderings. 

Can Nikola be the next Tesla? Never say never, especially in the year 2020. But my bet is that Trevor Milton is closer to Elizabeth Holmes than Elon Musk.

**Edit 3** Ahahahaha apparently Trevor gave out more update of their factory construction (remember production is supposed to start in 2021) at yesterday's quarterly call...and drum roll......

post,ipp3e9,,Don't be fooled. This IS The Market Crash: My DD.,"I've been researching this a LOT lately because I didn't want to get caught in it. Looking at trends and past data. I believe, strongly, that we're in the middle of the market crash. I used my knowledge and was able to fully exit my entire $500k portfolio on Tuesday, maintaining all my gains. I've even taken a sizeable position in SPY puts ($50k worth of Dec $260). I got my close friends out (well the ones who listened) on Friday at the first sign of positive movement.

First of all, a little history lesson on the [Minksy Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsky_moment#/media/File:Stylized_Minsky_Cycle.PNG). It's basically a theory for how market bubbles happen. It occurs in 5 steps. I will outline what they are in basic and how the current market looks in relation.

1. **Displacement**: This is the beginning of a new paradigm where the market changes in a big way. For this, that was the Coronavirus. This took place between February to April.
2. **Boom**: Increase in spending begins and major gains start to be made. Media attention and market involvement begin to increase. Currently, we've seen a HUGE increase in retail traders (who are extremely volatile) and massive media attention toward the stock market as it relates to corona news as well as stimulus and recovery speed gains. This took place between April and July.
3. **Euphoria**: People stop caring about any sort of reasonable investment strategy and just start throwing money at stuff. Tesla is a fantastic example of this, but many other stocks in the tech sector are guilty of this. July was the beginning of this phase as Tesla saw insane growth within a few week period and other companies followed suit very quickly. This continued into late August with Apple and Tesla going to stupid prices after their splits, and all the other big tech names reaching wild valuations.
4. **Profit Taking**: Smart money starts withdrawing funds from the market as they prepare for the crash.",13162,True,1599685339.0,2020-09-09 23:02:19,7749,1650,[deleted],stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ipp3e9/dont_be_fooled_this_is_the_market_crash_my_dd/,True,0.88,2020,tesla,top,False,False,0,
post,j59ovh,,So Tesla's quality control is embarrassingly bad. Our brand new model Y's roof just fell off,"My dad bought a brand new model Y today, and he brought me along to pick it up just in case he needed help with any tech problems. Everything was going fine and we were driving back home when we started to hear a ton of wind. I thought maybe a window was open but a minute later the entire glass roof just blew off. After a brief panic we turned around and drove the new Tesla convertible back to the dealership.

When we got back we called highway patrol to tell them that there was a car roof somewhere on the 580, but somebody might have gotten into an accident, I’m not sure. The manager at the dealership said that either the seal for the roof was faulty, or the factory just ... forgot to seal the roof on? I can’t imagine how something as big as the roof not being attached could make it past quality control. If this is a recurring problem a lot of people could get hurt. Has this ever happened before?

&#x200B;

Edit: The manager offered to get the car serviced for free, but we declined and are probably going to get an entirely new car. Whether we're still getting a Tesla is up to my dad but probably not.

post,ji0i4d,,How to profit off Global Warming: HVAC Market Research with Due Dilligence on 5 Air-Conditioner brands.,"# If you find this interesting please follow my account for more DD.

# I'm also working on an Excel file which will provide all fundamental data about a stock, more info about that on my account. TLDR at bottom!

**Introduction**

With the change and progressing to extremer climates, global warming is coming our way. It has been shown world governments are incapable of properly taking action against this threat. Since it seems like global warming won’t be stopped, we will have to start adapting to the new extreme climates. One way of ensuring a comfortable living/working space in this grim future is by making use of HVAC (Heating Ventilation & Air Conditioning). **And that’s what got me thinking**. My family has been hell bent on **NOT** getting air-conditioning. But with the summer temperatures ever more frequently reaching +40c with a humidity of +70%(Hup Holland Hup) it’s becoming unbearable. Sleepless nights, overheated pets, fainting, old people dying and just losing your will to live. These are all issues more people around the world are starting to face. Every place on earth is getting more extreme. Every place on earth is getting more need for Climate control. And every company is looking to profit of that! This is why my next play is in the HVAC industry. 

**Finding our compatible companies.** 

I only want to invest in the best companies. Living in The Netherlands I personally don’t know the best brands, luckily, I’ve got great internet. So, after spitting through some review sites these are the 5 public companies that came out best when looking for “Best HVAC/Air-conditioning companies/brands”. (Not ranked) 

1. Carrier (Day&Night, Bryant, Toshiba & 15 more)

2. Trane (American Standard, Thermo King & 7 more). 

3. Daikin (Goodman, Amana). 

4. Lennox (Service Experts, Allies Air Enterprises). 

5. Johnson Controls (Hitachi, York)

post,kpeffw,,Reasons We May Not Be in a Bubble,"I'm seeing a lot of posts comparing this to the 2000 dot-com bubble. Here's a breakdown of why we're likely not anywhere close to 2000 levels of craziness.

**First:**  During the dot-com era, the Nasdaq Composite's price-to-earnings valuation ran up as high as 200. By comparison, the index's P/E today is a relatively tame 28, only modestly higher from 23 at the end of 2019. 

**Second:** Interest rates were a very attractive 6% which provided a strong alternative to stocks. No such outlet exists today unless you trust bitcoin, or want to invest in paper gold.

**Third:** Much of the value gains we're seeing in the market can be tied directly to the fact that people who invest are making similar or better money this year, and spending significantly less causing them to save more and invest more:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html)

**Fourth:** The rest of the growth can largely be attributed to increased liquidity from all of the money printing. Stocks tend to mirror an increase in the money supply with their value making them a great hedge against inflation. The valuations of the 2000s weren't backstopped by QE or increased savings, making them much shakier.

**Fifth:** The money printing will likely go on for a while. People mistakenly assume we're printing against our 22T dollar economy when we're really printing against the 80-100T global economy for which are the reserve currency. A weak dollar benefits the global economy, and benefits us because we are the trading floor for the global economy.

This is a long but very illuminating read on why QE is necessary and actually helpful:

post,l1snpi,,Baupost’s Seth Klarman compares investors to ‘frogs in boiling water’ -ft," 

// Seth Klarman, the founder of hedge fund Baupost Group, has told clients central bank policies and government stimulus have convinced investors that risk “has simply vanished”, leaving the market unable to fulfil its role as a price discovery mechanism.

The private letter to investors in his fund, which was seen by the Financial Times, amounts to a damning critique of recent market behaviour by one of the world’s foremost value investors.

Mr Klarman criticised the Federal Reserve for slashing rates and flooding the financial system with money since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, arguing that the central bank’s moves have made it difficult to gauge the health of the US economy.

“With so much stimulus being deployed, trying to figure out if the economy is in recession is like trying to assess if you had a fever after you just took a large dose of aspirin,” he wrote. “But as with frogs in water that is slowly being heated to a boil, investors are being conditioned not to recognise the danger.”

The biggest problem with these unprecedented and sustained government and central bank interventions is that risks to capital become masked even as they mount

US stocks are up more than 75 per cent since their low in March, while spreads on corporate debt — a measure of how much extra interest corporate borrowers have to pay compared to the US government — returned to pre-Covid levels this month.

Mr Klarman — who founded Boston-based Baupost almost four decades ago and has grown it to $30bn in assets under management — underperformed the market in 2020.

He has been intensifying his criticisms of US central bank interventions for the past several months. In the latest quarterly letter, Mr Klarmen referred to the Fed as an “800-pound gorilla” that has priced out investors who typically provide liquidity in moments of distress.",3705,True,1611210018.0,2021-01-21 07:20:18,154,116,mag300,SecurityAnalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/l1snpi/bauposts_seth_klarman_compares_investors_to_frogs/,True,0.99,2021,both,top,False,False,0,

post,l3z5jq,,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low (average \~$67--I have to admit, the drop today was too tasty so my cost basis went up from yesterday)/share with my later buys averaged in), and I'm using money I can absolutely lose.

post,lcftzc,,10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.

post,lm2mry,,"BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, is starting to ""dabble"" in Bitcoin","https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/blackrock-has-started-to-dabble-in-bitcoin-says-rick-rieder.html

BlackRock’s Rick Rieder told CNBC on Wednesday the world’s largest asset manager has begun entering the bitcoin space.

The remarks from Rieder, who is BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, came on the same day bitcoin broke above $51,000 for the first time.

“Today the volatility of it is extraordinary, but listen, people are looking for storehouses of value,” Rieder said on “Squawk Box.” “People are looking for places that could appreciate under the assumption that inflation moves higher and that debts are building, so we’ve started to dabble a bit into it.”

In January, BlackRock added bitcoin futures as an potential investment for two of its funds, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The funds are BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities and BlackRock Global Allocation Fund.

A number of other financial institutions, such as BNY Mellon and Mastercard, have made entrances into the crypto space in recent days. BNY Mellon, the nation’s oldest bank, will launch a digital assets unit later this year, while Mastercard intends to support certain cryptocurrencies on its formal network.

Electric vehicle maker Tesla also announced last week it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin using cash on its balance sheet and intends to begin accepting the digital coin as payment for its products.

The price of bitcoin has risen more than 70% this year, adding to a major rally that began in the fall. “My sense is the technology has evolved and the regulation has evolved to the point where a number of people find it should be part of the portfolio, so that’s what’s driving the price up,” Rieder said.

Despite bitcoin’s growing respectability as an asset class, Rieder said Wednesday that how much exposure an investor should have “depends on what the rest of your portfolio looks like.",2314,True,1613590487.0,2021-02-17 20:34:47,3646,1453,PZinger6,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lm2mry/blackrock_the_worlds_largest_money_manager_is/,True,0.97,2021,tesla,top,False,True,0,
post,lqfhuz,,Technology stocks are crashing – what now,"A friend just messaged me saying that his portfolio lost 10% of its value recently and that this was complete doomsday. Judging by the futures, the NQ is down 6.8% from its highs (a 1.8% gap down this morning alone). I get that, it's frustrating.

It is also noteworthy that the sell-off hurts technology stocks in particular. But mind that they were also the largest beneficiary in recent months:

* Nasdaq 100 is 53% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* S&P 500 is 31% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* DJIA is 19% above its weekly 200 EMA.

Which one is going to be hurt first and foremost once a correction is underway? Of course it's going to be the most stretched industry sector. Information technology is 28% of the S&P 500, and 20% of the DJIA.

If you buy stocks, you've got to have conviction in them. You've got to know what you are buying. Am I going to dump all my holdings just because they're ""overvalued"". Of course not. I'm going to hang in there with stocks going down 30% and then come back up 80%. Even if that takes another 3 years. It's the nature of the market and it is great at weeding out the less convinced.

Volatility is the price you pay for your returns.

If you held Apple all these years, you are sitting on a fortune now. Same goes for Amazon and many other megabrands of today. Amazon went top to bottom 60% several times in its history. You've got to have conviction in what you're buying to hold onto such kind of volatility. I also go to the grocery store to pick my favorite marmalade brand. If there's a 30% discount I'll pile up. But you cannot ever pile up if you don't have conviction in your holdings in the first place.

So here's what I would do. Go through your portfolio name by name. Ask yourself why it's there in the first place. Start with ""I own XYZ because..."".

post,lt7oop,,JPMorgan advises clients to expose 1% of their portfolio to Bitcoin,"In a recent note to clients, strategists from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) suggested a one percent portfolio allocation to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

As reported by Bloomberg, JPM strategists Joyce Chang and Amy Ho opined that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against fluctuations from traditional assets like bonds, stocks, and commodities. However, they advised clients to allocate a small percentage due to the risk of major downturns in Bitcoin’s value.

After setting a new all-time high above $58,000, the value of the digital asset slumped to less than $45,000 and has been struggling to recover ever since.

Chang and Ho told investors:

>*In a multi-asset portfolio, investors can likely add up to 1% of their allocation to cryptocurrencies in order to achieve any efficiency gain in the overall risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio.*

Bitcoin has welcomed major investments from the likes of Paul Tudor Jones, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and MicroStrategy. The endorsement from JPM comes at a time when institutional players are rushing to accumulate the digital asset. As per Bloomberg’s report, America’s oldest bank BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has also announced plans to enable Bitcoin transactions for its clients.

The strategists were quick to add that cryptocurrencies should be viewed as an investment vehicle and opposed to being funding currencies like the USD or EUR. This appears to be contrary to earlier statements from other JPM analysts that called cryptocurrencies the “poorest hedge for major drawdowns in equities.”

This request was filed in response to the revelation last fall that SoftBank was the ""Nasdaq whale.” SoftBank was responsible for stoking a huge rally in tech stocks, the Financial Times reported, because around August it began buying billions of dollars worth of call options in a shift for the company, fueling a rally that pushed up the share prices of tech companies it held billions of dollars of equity in.

Thanks in large part to a rally sparked by SoftBank’s high-risk market plays, firms like Tesla and Apple were up 74 and 21 percent, respectively, in the month of August alone. Executed through a small desk of traders and chief executive Masayoshi Son himself, the trading unit―named SB Northstar―and its bets won the company some $4 billion in gains at the beginning of September, before quickly melting away into nearly $3 billion in losses by the end of the month.

In a January letter responding to Greenspan’s initial request, and months after the reporting on Softbank became public, the SEC said that its search did not turn up any relevant records.",3308,True,1616645951.0,2021-03-25 05:19:11,3383,340,rrdonoo,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mcpqqp/the_sec_confirms_it_is_investigating_softbank_for/,True,0.99,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,

post,n6dh3d,,I sold every share I own today.,"I got into the market last year post Covid around May or June. Since then it has been an absolute rollercoaster trying to pick stocks. I was up 100% on multiple stocks including Tesla, Carvana, Square, Fiverr. I didn't sell because you're supposed to hold for the long term I heard, only for those stocks and others over many months to drop 30% - 80% or more. I bought some new stocks in February only for them to then drop 30% or more in a matter of months. I have spent months this year and last inside on beautiful days going cross eyed staring at charts trying to figure out what stock to buy, what to sell, why this stock is going up, why this stock is going down. As we speak I'm sitting inside on a beautiful day writing this. I have admitted to myself I don't understand stocks. I don't understand businesses. I have reached a point where I stopped caring about losing money. That's a dangerous road I'm sure. With the amount of stocks I've bought and sold, I don't know if I'm up or down.

Evidence I don't understand stocks is that today Twitter is worth less than it was in 2013 when it IPO'd. One of the most popular social media apps in the entire world I would have assumed would be worth something. Apparently not. It may seem I'm impatient or have a short term horizon for the market, but if I bought Twitter in 2013, I would have wasted 8 years of my life holding it.

PLTR backed by Peter Thiel and signing multi-million dollar contracts week after week, well the bottom just fell out. While it will probably go back up, I don't understand when and why it would. If a company with that much growth potential can't go up, what chance does anything else have.

10 months ago I bought DKNG at $25 and sold a few months later for about $50. Today it's worth a little more than was 10 months ago. I'm glad I got out when I did.

So, I am buying the S&P.

Tesla's earnings in the first quarter were $438 million.

$101 million (23%) of that came from selling Bitcoin for profit.

The other interesting part is that it would have been an earnings miss without the trading.

Did one make the other happen?

Considering the recent news about not allowing Bitcoin anymore, it's certainly a move worth mentioning.

post,nrw7cv,,Biden bans US investment in Chinese military and tech surveillance sectors,"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/03/biden-bans-us-investment-chinese-military-tech-surveillance

Joe Biden has signed an executive order that bans American entities from investing in dozens of Chinese companies with alleged ties to defense or surveillance technology sectors.

In a move that his administration says will expand the scope of a legally flawed Trump-era order, the US treasury will enforce and update on a “rolling basis” the new ban list of about 59 companies.

It also bars buying or selling publicly traded securities in target companies, and replaces an earlier list from the defense department, senior administration officials told reporters.

The order prevents US investment from supporting the Chinese military-industrial complex, as well as military, intelligence, and security research and development programs, Biden said in the order.

“In addition, I find that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside [China] and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constitute unusual and extraordinary threats,” Biden said.

A White House fact sheet on the order said the policy would take effect for those companies listed on 2 August.

Major Chinese firms included on the previous defense department list were also placed on the updated list, including Aviation Industry Corp of China (AVIC), China Mobile Communications Group, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC).

SMIC is key to China’s national drive to boost its domestic chip sector.

post,pjh26x,,Is currently possible to use the Tesla Turbine in a practical way?,"Recently I heard about the Tesla Turbine, it intrigyed me so much so I started to search information about, so I'm not the most knowledgeable on the topic, but I found that even with the extremly high possible efficiencie of the turbine (over than 90%) this design is not prolificly used today.

The reasons for this that I found for this situation are the next:

* A Tesla turbine can rotate producing more than 35,000 rpm in practical aplications used for energy generators are needed very big disks, 2-4 meters diameter, in ideal operation the speed at the edges of the discs can exceed by several times that of the turbines currently used. As far as I know, no material in its time would be able to resist the deformation produced, in addition to being very difficult to control.
* Each turbine needs and specific arrangement for disks determined by the size of the bundary layer according to the fluid which will be used to power to the turbine. Any change on the separation between disks highly decrease the efficiency.

As I said I'm not the knowledgeable about these topics, but I was really interested to know if currently exist a material able to be used in a Tesla turbine, or how the problems could be solved. Neither I know if the original design is able to be used today with all its possible efficiency.

What benefit is there to having such a low number of employees? Lower costs yes but with the money they control and need to invest surely it would make sense for them to have more than just 13 employees doing this?

I haven’t counted it up, but it’s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I’m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I’d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. 

These are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.

**Understand the Trading Environment**

One mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.

**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can’t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. 

In between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that’s more likely to pull back.  It’s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).

I try not to get caught by these patterns.

Tesla meanwhile has seen China quarterly sales for 2021 flattish at 69K, 62K and 75K.  China will likely sell 3 million EV's this year, half the worlds volume and Tesla sales are flat for the year.  Tesla might sell a lowly 9%.

Tesla dominates the US markets of course, where few EV models are on sale.  EV sales might be 3% of automotive sales.

Whilst investors will assert these stats do not.matter and Tesla's valuation is all about  tech, batteries and robo-taxis, it still does not sell any car related tech beyond its own cars.  Take up of FSD is a lowly 11%.  It still buys it's battery cells.  By its own statements it has a level 2/3 driver assist whilst companies like Waymo are already starting to offer level 4/5 robo-taxis in cities like San Fran (a free trial program has commenced).

With Tesla slipping badly in the two biggest and mature EV markets globally, it's EV mkt share has fallen from near 18% highs in 2019 to 14.7% YTD in 2021.  With Europe and China likely to see 20% EV sales, the Tesla domination of global car mkts story is looking utterly flawed, yet its market capitalisation is now than the entire companies combined that sell 99% of cars and are adding EV's faster.

Tesla is frankly trading at utterly ludicrous levels given the clear reality of global EV market growth.",2036,True,1636029919.0,2021-11-04 13:45:19,11484,2304,Historical_Job_8609,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qmjr7o/tesla_sells_1_of_cars_globally_yet_is_priced_more/,True,0.84,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,
post,qqy68o,,"Breaking. Reports are coming in that Evergrande missed a bond payment within its 30 day grace window, putting them officially in default. German company DMSA has filed formal bankrupcy proceedings...","News is trickling in on this right now (gaining steam on Twitter), looks like mainstream sources haven't picked it up yet or are downplaying. Here You can find DMSA's press release, [http://www.dmsa-agentur.de/pressemitteilungen](http://www.dmsa-agentur.de/pressemitteilungen)

From what I gather, a $148 million offshore bond payment due ""today"" still hasn't been paid, triggering formal bankruptcy proceedings against the company.  I believe that the deadline was midnight in China timezone, and the press release was filed right around there. We cannot know for sure if a last-hour payment was made at this point until confirmed further. But if this is all true , it could have some pretty strong short term shocks for the market.

For now treat this with a grain of salt until more verification and information. Either way, buckle up.

**EDIT 2: Section of note:**

""Particularly problematic for Evergrande: all 23 outstanding bonds have a cross-default clause. ""This means that if a single one of these bonds defaults, all 23 outstanding bonds automatically have 'default' status"" DMSA senior analyst Metzler knows. However, this does not automatically result in a bankruptcy for Evergrande Group. To determine bankruptcy, a insolvency petition must be filed with the court. This can be done either by the company itself or by one or more of the company's creditors. And this is precisely what is now planned.

If anyone has a sense on when the irrationality will end, it's probably him and his advisors.

This whole thing about Elon trying to cash out some stock to pay taxes as a nice guy, was an obvious BS excuse. Then the media comes out saying his REAL intention is to pay taxes that are due. Brilliant, double play to cover for his personal cash out. 

If Elon had faith that his stock still had room to grow, there is no chance in hell he'd be selling. He'd just be getting a loan to cover his tax liabilities, while his equity value increases. The fact that he's trying to cash out shows he thinks it's near peak and about to go down. All the media drama is just an attempt to retain value for as long as possible to distract and justify his cash out. 

It's crazy how I see NO ONE talking about this... And instead it's all about ""clever redditors"" seeing his real intentions are to cover his tax liability. No it's not.

post,r0m3yh,,I regret buying a Tesla and I haven't driven a single mile yet.,"This isn't a post about charging or the lack of physical buttons. 

This is a post about a complete lack of customer service. 

I preordered a Model 3 LR three months ago. I was given a delivery window of Mid November to mid December. I got a message last week saying it was my turn to pick up my car. Sweet. They give me a choice of three days on their website to pick up the car. November 24, 25, 26. I find it a bit odd that thanksgiving they are open but I'm working on the 24th and the 26th and on such short notice I can't get out of work. So I put down delivery for the 25th. After all other stores are open on thanksgiving and the site blacked out other dates. 

I get messages from Tesla that I need to get my car insurance and pay the down payment or I won't be able to get the car. No problem. 

I pay the down payment via their app and get the insurance. I upload the proof to their app. All good. 

Then yesterday on 11/22/2021 I get a phone call at 3 pm saying that I can no longer pick up the car on 11/25 because they aren't actually open. 

Uh ok. So you tell me this after I put down the down payment and pay for the insurance. I'm a little pissed at this point but I get it. Let me pick it up another day then. And why didn't you tell me sooner?

They would only let me pick the 24th or 26th. That's it. I asked them can I pick up the car on December 2nd because I have work and can't reschedule or get someone to cover me on such short notice. Their response is ""no, we can't hold the car that long. We will give your car to someone else and you can wait another 3-4 weeks for another car to come in.""

The heck? They made the mistake. Took my money. Made me buy insurance for a car that I don't actually have and then they try to bully me into a specific delivery date on short notice? That's not fair. 

To make matters worse I try to post my story to r/teslamotors and it gets automatically deleted. I appealed it to a mod and he says ""This is not high quality content.",2484,True,1637698457.0,2021-11-23 21:14:17,13610,1579,[deleted],electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/r0m3yh/i_regret_buying_a_tesla_and_i_havent_driven_a/,True,0.93,2021,both,top,False,False,0,

post,rxqpdy,,How long can a Tesla survive stranded on a freeway in the winter? I did the math to find out.,"After reading the Washington Post article about electric cars being unsuitable when stranded on a freeway in the winter, I decided to do an experiment to find out the truth.

**The Scenario**

* My Model X was fully preconditioned prior to the start of the test
* The battery was charged to 80% prior to the start of the test
* Temperatures here in Michigan today were very uniform.  20 degrees all day.
* After preconditioning, the Model X was parked in my driveway for the test period
* Seat heaters, and steering wheel heaters were activated.  
* Cabin temp set to 70 degrees.  HVAC on Auto mode.
* Camp Mode was started, and the car was left in the driveway for the test period
* Vehicle doors will remain closed during the test period.  Mobile App used to acquire data every hour.
* Test duration:  5 hours

**The Raw Data**

* 79% - 207 miles - 11:45am - **Test Start**
* 76% - 201 miles - 12:53pm
* 74% - 196 miles  - 1:46pm
* 69% - 181 miles - 3:48pm
* 67% - 175 miles - 4:45pm - **Test End**

**The Results**

* Model X used an average of 2.4% of battery per hour throughout the test period
* Range went from 207 miles, to 175 miles at the end of the test.
* 5 hours of Camp mode utilized…
   * 32 miles of range
   * 12 % of range
* 24 hours of Camp Mode would require (extrapolated)…
   * 153 miles of range
   * 58% of range

This data conclusively proves that a Model X can easily keep all passengers in complete comfort during a 24 hour duration event while stranded on the freeway in the winter, using less than half of the maximum battery capacity.  All the while, the passengers have access to Netflix, video games, and plenty of online entertainment.

&#x200B;

Next step - I might re-run this same test tomorrow with my Model S.

**EDIT:**  It's going to be a bit colder on Friday, but I'm thinking about running the test again on the Model X with a 50 degree interior temperature, and running the original test (70 degree interior) on my Model S.",2034,True,1641507810.0,2022-01-06 23:23:30,1183,343,TheGadgetGuy1,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/rxqpdy/how_long_can_a_tesla_survive_stranded_on_a/,True,0.97,2022,tesla,top,False,False,0,

Second, I went with a Tesla because the technology was way above (IMO) the rest. Very much best in class, even though I feel like the outer design is a little too “different” for my taste. I’ve really enjoyed driving it. But the gap is quickly closing, and some of the design decisions and manufacturing makes me scratch my head.

The “ashamed” part, however, stems from the leader of the organization. He has become so polarizing that I can’t even have a conversation with people I meet regarding my Tesla without his name coming up. It makes me feel like people are looking at me as if I share his views because I own one. I wish he would just fade into obscurity with his billions and call it a win.

post,194ajsm,,My Tesla with a drivable 2000 to 4000 solar array,"I've been a long time reader, but not poster. For the last two years I've been working on a 2000 watt to 4000 watt solar system for my Model Y -- Today I can charge anywhere in the world!

I can reliably get 20 miles to 60 miles per day. I can expand these solar panels with ease, and contract them when I want to start driving.

I've also decided to put all the 3D printed parts required to build this online at [dartsolar.com](https://dartsolar.com) \-- if you want me to build you one, or if you want to get the free 3D parts and the blueprints for this build enter your email in the green box on the link.

The reason I can pack so many solar panels is because I am using telescoping carbon fiber tubes as my mechanism of expansion and contraction, as opposed to mechanical sliders. This allows me to pack 4000 watts of solar on a Tesla, without going over the max roof weight capacity of 165 lbs.

Overall it has been a fun project so far and I am designing Beta2. Beta1 is 11 inches high and is made out of wood. Beta2 will be fully made of carbon fiber and will be 6 inches high. Right now I researching the DC-to-DC charging and hot wiring.

Thank you all for your inspiration by sharing and discussing all things Tesla, **and of course ask me anything in the comments** and I'll reply shortly.

post,1b5o2uy,,Tesla hate is real,"After driving ICE cars that belonged to my parents or relying on public transport for the past years I decided after finishing my studies and getting a job I decided to buy my first own car. After taking into account costs + fun drive + luxury I decided an electric car would be the right option. Settled for a Tesla Model Y and am super happy. 
I obviously told my friends and family and damn  never expected such a negative reaction. 

I know there was a negative stigma around them but  literally from work, friends and family everybody was just criticizing my decision.
Instead of being happy for me or at least only mildly cricising due not having an electric car before I got comments like what a bad decision, never would buy electric, car will be worth 0 in 3 years, laughing about it being stupid, never able to take a long trip, charging on roadrips for hours with no range, etc. 

I couldn’t even argue with them and present my facts everybody just straight up was condescending and didn’t change their opinion. Yesterday another friend found out and said: „A Tesla/electric car driver will not be allowed to step into my car“ lol

Did you experience similar hate too? Really interesting that from my whole environment young or old has still such a big hate for Teslas or electric cars which I just dont understand like you dont have to like them but why hate so much when it doesn’t affect you…

Some ideas based on customer feedback 

DMV Test Mode- DMVs around the country are failing young drivers primary due to our exceptional one pedal driving. You could piggy back the brake burnish command with a different UI.  This would force the driver to use the pedal and then the instructors would have less to grip about. 

Drivers Ed Mode- create a program that teaches young drivers the rules of the road through a series of challenges.  In this mode the vehicle will set up routes based on the users progress through the training these routes would become more advanced. Make it into a “simulator” of sorts and they could even practice the basics while parked.  

So folks, let’s have it.  I’m still held to some NDAs but my experiences are mine.  I’ll still gladly help you when and where I can.

post,1eimxw9,,"I tracked the price of 3000 used Teslas, here is what I found","I tracked the price of used cars listed on the Tesla website for the last 4 months. In total, I tracked \~3000 cars. I focused on cars listed in the San Francisco Bay Area. I used a linear regression model to determine what factors influence the price.

**Some insights:**

* Model Y and Model 3 cars are listed for 5 days on average before being removed/sold. Model X and S take a little longer, with an average of 7 days.
* Tesla automatically lowers the price if a car does not sell. On average the price decreased by $200 per day.
* 68% of all cars have basic Autopilot, 29% have FSD, 3% come with Enhanced Autopilot.
* 99% of eligible used cars include the Acceleration Boost option.

***Pricing factor estimates by model:***

**Model 3**

*Price reducing factors*

* $97 per 1000 miles driven
* $127 for each extra month in age
* $860 when previously repaired

*Model variants:*

* $3500 for Long range ($9000 new)
* $2300 performance version (new $7000)

*Premium options:*

* $1400 for EAP
* $2600 for FSD (new $8000)
* $90 for the white interior (new $1000)

Black ($221) and gray ($150) have a better resale value, compared to red (-$142), white (-$93) and blue (-$56).

No difference was found between 18 and 19 inch wheels ($1000 new)

**Model Y**

*Price reducing factors*

* $133 per 1000 miles driven
* $239 for each extra month in age
* $1600 when previously repaired

*Model variants:*

* $5500 for AWD ($3000 new)
* $3100 performance version (new $7000)

*Premium options:*

* $1900 for EAP
* $2800 for FSD (new $8000)
* $120 for the white interior (new $1000)

post,1f7a9i7,,Stranger blown away by FSD,"So I was activating a charger in a strip mall parking lot when a gentleman approached and started asking the usual EV questions.  ""Is it free to charge, how far does it go, how many chargers are there"". Years ago, these interactions were somewhat common, but as more and more people know about EVs,  it's not anymore. So it was a pleasant surprise, and I happily answered. 

Then he asked 'is this one of those self driving ones?'.

'yep, drove me here'

'no... It didn't actually?'

'yep' ... The look on his face was pessimistic so... 'if you have a few moments, hop on and see for yourself'. 12.3.6 is good, but it certainly has issues, but whatever, let's see what this random guy thinks...

He excitedly agrees, and we get in and I enter a random waypoint and let FSD pull out of the parking stall and off we go. I proactively mentioned it can be a bit silly in parking lots, and it certainly was very slow and cautious... But the guy was too blown away to care. As FSD turned onto public roads, and as it navigated the world around it, the amazement in this guy's eyes and voice grew by the moment. 

It was maybe a 10 minute drive, in mostly residential roads, but it was perfect. I didn't have to intervene once. Stops, yields, pedestrians and bikes, a car blocking the path while it turned around, fitting through narrow gaps due to parked cars and an oncoming big truck, slowing for speed bumps... And when it returned us to the parking lot, I selected a parking stall and it parked itself.

post,1frg26x,,Rented a Model 3. I get why rental companies are dumping Teslas.,"Preface: I own a Model Y and I love it. Best car I've ever owned.

Had to go to Albuquerque for a short 2-day business trip. Rented a compact car from Budget. Guy asked how far I'd be driving, I said almost none, staying in airport area. He asked if he can give me a Tesla, I said sure. He told me it was a Y, but it was actually a RWD 3 with the LFP pack.

After getting in the car, ALL the settings were jacked up. Screen on Light rather than auto, headlights on rather than auto, climate manual not auto. Random safety features turned off. Autopilot set to TACC-only (although I get that). Sentry on. Bunch of other ones I forget, but I had to fix almost every setting. Luckily battery was at 98% so thats good. Unlike Hertz, Budget does not allow app connectivity, just the card.

I drove away and attended a meeting for a few hours. Came back out to the A/C humming away, I had missed the cabin overheat protection setting, it drained 10% of the battery in the hot New Mexico sun. Luckily I only used 20% of the battery my whole trip because I stayed pretty local. Car was also sort of janky: really bad wind noise/gap in driver window somewhere, and suspension felt a little rattle-y compared to my Y. Car had 21k miles. However I was impressed with the power of the RWD model. It's totally adequate, if not impressive.

Anyway, the ONLY reason I was able to navigate all this is because I own a Tesla and I know all this stuff. I cannot imagine any non-Telsa-owner being able to figure all this out and being happy with the experience. And I didn't even have to figure out how/where to charge it, that would be a whole other ball of wax for a new person. Beyond depreciation, I bet they've gotten tons of user complaints on these.

So that's my rant. Thanks for reading.",1777,False,1727535321.0,2024-09-28 16:55:21,1876,358,brunofone,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1frg26x/rented_a_model_3_i_get_why_rental_companies_are/,True,0.93,2024,tesla,top,False,False,0,

post,1gs3w77,,My Tesla with an expanding solar roof -- generates 4.5kwh per day,"Hello Reddit, this is an update of the last year worth of work on a personal project of mine -- placing an expandable solar array on my Tesla. And like all the past builds, the blueprints will be online for anyone to access. The last prototype Beta2 had lots of great feedback, and I am excited to share RC1 (Release Candidate 1). Officially the community is called [DartSolar](https://dartsolar.com) now, if you search online you can find our Reddit post from last year and all our blueprints.

https://preview.redd.it/wmzwpush541e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=08c6381084c14dc179fdd4d80426618f37c37d78

https://i.redd.it/ctxmyr9m341e1.gif

This is a 1kw solar array, composed of 6 smaller custom solar panels. These smaller solar panels are more serviceable, easier to replace, and makes it cheaper to fix. The roof rack uses custom made telescopic tubes make of aluminum (mostly), and some one segment made of stainless steel that I'm planning to replace with carbon fiber. However, when I release the blueprints I'll have the aluminum and carbon fiber specifications. You can get the blueprints of Beta2, and get these blueprints [here](https://dartsolar.com).

https://i.redd.it/aua77z4g441e1.gif

The entire design had to be aerodynamic af. I wanted no more than 2% aerodynamic drag loss. So I tested different designs on a 10-mile stretch where I would drive with the DartSolar on and off. The current model is about 1-inch tall, we created a custom made roof rack support to further decrease the height. Because the whole thing is flat we've observed 1% drag loss when driving at 30 mph, and about 2% when driving at 60 mph. In my daily commute I rarely go over 60 mph.

https://i.redd.it/77di9blfx31e1.gif

The solar panels are locked when driving by magnetic locks. That way they are very easy to open, but also the panels will not open when you're driving. In the blueprints I'll also add a mechanical lock to absolutely ensure the panels stay in place.",6071,True,1731697328.0,2024-11-15 20:02:08,892,225,somid3,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1gs3w77/my_tesla_with_an_expanding_solar_roof_generates/,True,0.94,2024,tesla,top,False,False,0,
post,1gxe3oj,,Bedini SG energizer (!motor),"
Aaron murakami wrote a 3-book series on Bedini’s SG energizer. He states the machine’s output is sub 100% efficiency. The magic (which does happen) is IN the battery itself.

In essence, the goal of the motor/generator/energizer/<pick your confusing ambiguity here> is to impulse the battery. The mechanical part just adds noise to the understanding IMO. I made a PBC that generates plain impulses, originally it was a high-side bridge (for negative flyback spikes), but I adapted it for Bedini’s positive impulses.

Currently testing and can’t confirm yet the charging battery charges faster than the primary discharges. But I do see the “h” curve and a the right signals (I’d add a pic but this Reddit is limited)

The theory is that sharp impulses/energy gradients (which are aren’t that sharp once directed to the battery as it behaves as a capacitor widening the signal.) polarize (if that’s the right terminology for surrounding big ions with negative charge) the ions in the battery and they then autonomously migrate to the positive plates (i.e. not being actively pushed by current).

My PCB can run a couple Modes (high voltage impulses, capacitors discharges)
1st pic: high voltage impulses, shorted to the battery above zener BVR, (12V and 24V above secondary battery level). This causes the famous “h curve”

2nd pic: capacitor discharge mode. The h grows taller and thinner until it’s discharged violently on the battery.

3rd: pic schematic impulse PCB abstracted as a MOSFET. 

4th pic: Bedini inspired PCB, Master Ivo inspired impulse PCB, tesla coil, 12V secondary battery. 

I run both batteries with common ground and the primary biased up 6-12V, so the current that normally would be wasted to ground for charging the coil, ends up going to the secondary right before the impulse is caused.

Currently (1st and last pics) pushing secondary to avg 12.83V ; the primary steady at 18.71V ~120mA (started test +1hr ago and it marked 18.",2153,True,1732298635.0,2024-11-22 19:03:55,23,7,juanmf1,Tesla,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gxe3oj,False,0.97,2024,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1i362wr,,Do not push it - it’s winter,"Here we go. It finally happened to me and I thought it wouldn’t. In my 2020 MYLR took trip to NJ on an overnight stay. I left at 100% and arrived around 20%. After a long workday, I went straight to the hotel and arrived with about 6% left. After checking for food spots and Superchargers in the area, I thought it may be a good idea to get a little charge before heading into the office the next day. 

Looking at the superchargers, I saw they had a cheaper rate after midnight (around .20c) which is far cheaper than .45c during that peak dinner time. 

My logic led me to believe, charge at a ChargePoint while grabbing a bite just to get out of the low power state until midnight. 

With hot fresh food in hand, I was prepared for a Netflix and grub in the ride after selecting a ChargePoint location 6 miles away. The mood changed when I arrived to the ChargePoint location and the area is gated and marked for Employees only. I buzzed the gate, spoke to security and expressed my demise as I stared at a 2% state of charge and temperatures are in the low 20F. Security ensured the local Wegmans had a charger that I can use, as I made my way to Wegmans, I see a Hotel with charging stations available.. 

I made a quick turn and plugged in and received the check host error. At this point, we’re at 1%. While I walked to the front desk to explain myself. I passed a vacant Blink station which showed the 800 number for support. Somehow, I thought this would finally free me from the series of obscure stupidity. I plugged in, made the call and quickly learned the host (Hotel) needs to approve the charge as this is a private charge. 

I quickly unplug and neatly return the cable to its original position and make my way to Wegmans because you know, the security guard assured me. Upon my arrival, there is no charging option available and I park and search for the nearest Tesla Superchargers.",3065,True,1737080585.0,2025-01-17 03:23:05,779,135,Clear_Writing_2424,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1i362wr/do_not_push_it_its_winter/,True,0.95,2025,tesla,top,False,False,0,

In a speech at the House GOP Issues Conference in Miami on Monday, he also suggested he would remove Joe Biden’s program of paying subsidies to chip makers like Intel or TSMC to build fabrication plants in the U.S.

**Thoughts:** We will literally see a decision from Trump tonight regarding whether or not oil will be exempted from the tariffs, otherwise the stocks I'm watching on the OVERNIGHT exchange are F/GM/TM and TSLA/LCID (stands to lose rather than gain if oil is exempted) in addition to all the oil stocks that are standard (OIL, BP, XOM, etc).

post,1ie1jty,,Finally did it. Out with the Tesla.,"
Hey Everyone,

I have been a Tesla model y driver the last three years. My lease was up and due to recent developments with Elon and the staleness of having a Tesla (including a model 3 before) for the last 5 years; it was time for a change. 

Last night I made the jump and signed a lease of a 2024 Equinox EV 2RS all black. My lease isn’t up for a month and I just went to look and test drive anyway. I drove it and was blown away. It feels remarkably similar to my Dual Motor model Y but the interior quality was better. Loved every bit of it. It even has super cruise. The only option it’s lacking that I wish it had is the panoramic sunroof. 

I feel like I got a great deal (I negotiated pretty hard). 24 month lease with $315 per month lease with $0 down, 10,000 miles. All in all, spending $120 less per month than my Tesla. Very happy!

post,1iejost,,Tesla: The Company is One Giant Lie,"
Tesla just posted abysmal earnings, and how does Elon respond? With another song and dance about robots and self-driving cars—fairy tales he’s been spinning for years with no real results. Meanwhile, the fundamentals are crumbling: declining margins, demand issues, and brutal price cuts just to move inventory.

This company has been built on hype, not substance. FSD is nowhere near what was promised, Cybertruck is a disaster, and now they’re leaning on AI pipe dreams to distract from the financial mess.

Trade war is on!,"Canada is imposing it’s own 25 per cent tariffs on $155 billion worth of U.S. goods after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped Canada with 25 per cent tariffs on all goods and 10 per cent tariffs on oil, natural gas and electricity.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the tariffs will take effect on $30 billion worth of goods starting Tuesday with a further $125 billion worth of products being taxed 21 days later.

Trudeau elected to go ahead with retaliatory tariffs even though Trump’s order includes a mechanism to escalate the rates if Canada retaliates against the U.S.

Canada will also look at how to limit export of rare minerals to the US which are crucial for US tech and car companies like Tesla.

Market cap $370  
Tangible Book of $540 million  
EV of $940 million  
Net debt $400 million with $160 million of operating lease liabilities

TTM operating loss of $83 million. 2021-2022 operating income was circa $200 million annually.

P/Book of 0.68.

Estimate of fair value: **0.9-1X tangible book, with further upside if profitability can get to 2018 or 2021-2022 levels.**

**20-50% upside, possibly 70%+ if profitability gets close to 2018 or 2021-2022 levels**

Radius Recycling is a metal scrapper based in Portland, Oregon, but with scrapping locations in California, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia, and Alabama. The two biggest products are ""ferrous scrap"" and ""non-ferrous scrap"" which are metallic scrap processed/recycled from junk - think old cars, railway cars, etc.

Ferrous scrap was $370 million in revenue, 56% of Fiscal Q1 2025 revenue of $660 million. The division produced 1.1 million tons of ferrous scrap priced at $338/ton in Q1 2025. Ferrous scrap can be fed into electric arc furnaces (like those at Nucor NUE or Steel Dynamics STLD) to make new steel.

Non-ferrous scrap produced $180 million in revenue, 27% of Q1 2025 revenue. Non-ferrous scrap is dominated by aluminum and copper scrap, so prices mainly off of aluminum and copper pricing.

The company has also done some vertical integration, and it built its own electric arc furnace steel mill, which can process the company's own scrap. RDUS own EAF produced 125,000 tons of steel, sold at $771 per ton last quarter, for $97 million in revenue, or 15% of total revenue.

The company had a surge of profitability in 2022 during the strong pricing environment, but if you look over its history, it has been a boom and bust cyclical. It did very well in the pre-2008 industrial metals bull market, and has struggled to make consistent profits since, occasionally doing well like in 2017-2018, then a weak 2019-2020, then a strong 2021-2022, and now an abysmal 2023-2024 cycle.",8255,True,1739692455.0,2025-02-16 08:54:15,20,0,jackandjillonthehill,SecurityAnalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1iqncw1/rdus_radius_recycling/,True,0.92,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1j7l0bv,,TSLA being investigated by Transport Canada for cooking their books in Canada to snag EV rebates without selling cars.,"The article notes that **four Tesla dealerships claimed to have sold 8,653 Teslas in 3 days.** Assuming each dealership opens from 9AM-5PM, that's **90 cars sold per hour per dealership**. Worth noting that Canada's EV rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how Tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did...

Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M.

I guess that's one way to maintain revenue while sales drop 90%!

Note: investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation of official wrongdoing yet.

Edit: Since this post got more attention then I expected. Yes I posted this Sunday and TSLA is currently down 13% today. However I do not think this is causing the drop, and rather it’s an overall market pull back from trade wars and from Europe sales declines.

#Trump’s Aggression Sours Europe on US Cloud Giants

###Companies in the EU are starting to look for ways to ditch Amazon, Google, and Microsoft cloud services amid fears of rising security risks from the US. But cutting ties won’t be easy.

> The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti–Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.

> There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies’ cloud services—including servers, storage, and databases—citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.

> “There’s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,” says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.

> The moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become “more technologically independent” and saying the status quo creates “security and reliability risks.",8585,True,1742802557.0,2025-03-24 08:49:17,10136,641,YourFuture2000,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jilfwg/companies_in_the_eu_are_starting_to_look_for_ways/,True,0.97,2025,both,top,False,False,0,

By Marco Chown Oved from the Star

""Canada has frozen $43 million in payments to Tesla pending a line-by-line investigation into its last-minute surge in EV rebate claims made on the final weekend of the government program.

The American EV maker run by U.S. presidential adviser Elon Musk will also be excluded from all future EV rebate programs as long as tariffs are in place, former transport minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement.

The stop-payment order appears to have been made before the current election was called Sunday, though Freeland only confirmed it Tuesday, while on the campaign trail for her University—Rosedale seat.

“As soon as I became Transport Minister, I asked the department to stop all payments for Tesla vehicles in order to fully examine each claim individually and determine whether all are eligible and valid.

post,1jq4hf3,,US Senate passed bill by slim margin in a 51-48 vote to block Trump's tariffs on imports from Canada,"4 Republicans cross the floor to vote with Democrats to pass a bill that would remove import tariffs on Canadian goods.

This still needs to pass the house (which has republican majority), and even if it passes the house, president can still veto. At which point it goes back to the senate and 2/3 need to vote to overturn the veto.

Low chance, but indication that dissent is happening within party lines given the economic downturn of tariff policy.

Interesting to see how many more house reps and senators break from party lines after today's ""liberation"" tariffs have time to impact markets and consumer prices

post,1jqyy5b,,US Equities lost 90%-and took 25 years to recover.,"Everyone is saying ""dip dip dip"" as if we are experiencing an overreaction to a small segment bubble. 

95 years ago the US levied the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, worldwide tariffs that were designed to encourage domestic production and punish ""cheating countries"". This kicked off a trade war that had no small part in causing a world-wide depression. 

The US has not levied global tariffs of this degree since then. Until yesterday.

What happened to US equities?  After a roaring bull run during which wealth was printed and the every-day man flung money in the market it crashed. But not overnight. In fits and starts the DJI lost 90% of its value over a 3 year period. 

It took *25* years for it to return to an ATH. 

Trump has fired 10s of thousands of federal employees. He's spiking unemployment. He's taxing imports to the tune of 50-100%. Other countries will do the same to us. Our companies will start having mass layoffs, crushing economic activity and investment. Domestic production will not return, everyone one will be out of money to buy stuff anyways. The SH tariffs did nothing to encourage domestic manufacturing, it just made everyone poorer. 

Maybe our monetary policy will prevent a Great Depression and we escape with ""only"" 8-10 percent unemployment, mild stagflation and the market takes 3-5 years to recover after a 50% fall.
 
I'd love to hear the thesis of *why* the market will recover or be higher in the next 12-24 months when we have a historical model staring us in the face.

Literally all Trump is doing is exactly what he promised on the campaign. And virtually every economist knew it would cause a recession.

post,1jyagqg,,TSM: My Highest Conviction Buy — Despite the Tariff and China Risk,"Hi all, 

I have been following TSMC for years, and it is my highest conviction buy...even in the tariff situation. TSMC has a technical monopoly on the most advanced chips in the world. TSMC has pricing power, and the demand for those chips will explode, driven by the increased demand for AI, cloud services and EV adoption. 

I value the shares at $338, more than double the current price. The opportunity exists because the market is discounting the stock price to account for the China and tariffs risks. The market thinks China taking over Taiwan is a real risk. I believe that the risk is overblown as the US won’t allow China to conquer Taiwan.

Any thoughts?

post,1jyghal,,Tariffs are back on Trump says!,"**Trump on Truth Social**: NOBODY is getting “off the hook” for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst! There was no Tariff “exception” announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff “bucket.” The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER! The Golden Age of America, which includes the upcoming Tax and Regulation Cuts, a substantial amount of which was just approved by the House and Senate, will mean more and better paying Jobs, making products in our Nation, and treating other Countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us. The bottom line is that our Country will be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

This is why you don't believe any news over the weekend unless Trump or the White House covers on it. Tariffs are back on now!

post,1k1p0mo,,"Tesla speeds up odometers to avoid warranty repairs, US lawsuit claims","[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-speeds-odometers-avoid-warranty-213536596.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-speeds-odometers-avoid-warranty-213536596.html)

(Reuters) - Tesla faces a proposed class action claiming it speeds up odometers on its electric vehicles so they fall out of warranty faster, saving Elon Musk's company from having to pay for repairs.

The plaintiff Nyree Hinton alleged that Tesla odometer readings reflect energy consumption, driver behavior and ""predictive algorithms"" rather than actual mileage driven.

He said the odometer on the 2020 Model Y he bought in December 2022 with 36,772 miles on the clock ran at least 15% fast, based on his other vehicles and driving history, and for a while said he drove 72 miles a day when at most he drove 20.

Hinton, a Los Angeles resident, said this caused his 50,000-mile basic warranty to expire well ahead of schedule, leaving him with a $10,000 suspension repair bill that he thought Tesla should cover.

""By tying warranty limits and lease mileage caps to inflated 'odometer' readings, Tesla increases repair revenue, reduces warranty obligations, and compels consumers to purchase extended warranties prematurely,"" the complaint said.

Tesla and its lawyer did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment, but have denied all material allegations in the lawsuit. The Austin, Texas-based company does not have a media relations office.

Hinton is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for Tesla drivers in California, potentially encompassing more than 1 million vehicles, court papers show.

Tesla moved his lawsuit this month to Los Angeles federal court from a state court in that city.

The automaker has also faced litigation accusing it of inflating vehicle driving ranges.

In March 2024, a federal judge in Oakland, California said drivers in that case must pursue their claims in individual arbitrations, not a class action.

post,1k5g9yj,,Tesla reports disappointing quarterly results as automotive revenue plunges 20%,"Tesla reported a miss on the top and bottom lines in its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday as automotive revenue plunged 20% from a year earlier.

Here are the key numbers compared with LSEG expectations.

* **Earnings per share**: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated
* **Revenue**: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

It’s been a brutal start to the year for Tesla, with CEO Elon Musk spending much of his time in President Donald Trump’s White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. The president’s sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment, automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells.

Tesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday.

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

post,1kbesxa,,I talked with a Chinese factory owner to see what’s happening on the ground. TL;DR: China has mobilized tons of resources to exporters but there’s some signs of pain,"I’m an American in China but have been seeing very little foreign reporting about what’s happening in China, which is weird to me because it seems pretty important to get a clear picture of the trade war. So here’s what I learned from him.

**Gov support**

-The local government is helping and giving him low interest rate loans / short term financial support. This type of thing is very common throughout China right now - lots of local govs are mobilizing to support exporters thru the tariff war. Li Qiang, central gov minister, says central government help is probably coming too 

-Guangzhou, and I assume others too, has also organized tons of seminars since Liberation Day with buyers from Europe, Latin America, and Asia. A big source of replacement demand for his factory has been from these

-He’s getting lots of buyers from TikTok shops overseas. It seems like TikTok is helping a lot to mitigate the demand impact 

-The news story of Walmart, Target, Costco, etc. resuming some orders is true, he confirmed it. But the amounts are **very, very** small

**Pain**

-He’s already re-evaluating employees and firing some soon. He said most exporters in Guangzhou are cutting some employees, but extremely US dependent exporters have furloughed most of their workforces until mid May

**Some good news for the U.S?**

-Before Liberation Day he was building a factory in the US and has now fully committed to it. But it’s having issues since the raw materials are sourced from China and they’re getting hit with tariffs

[The full interview is here](https://www.yaphete.com/p/live-from-the-trade-war-2-chinas), I didn’t write everything here. Knowing the relative strength and ability of China or the US to withstand the tariff war is super important to trading right now I believe",1790,False,1746014813.0,2025-04-30 14:06:53,3556,427,TheOneTrueThrowaway1,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kbesxa/i_talked_with_a_chinese_factory_owner_to_see/,True,0.97,2025,tesla,top,False,False,0,

* I'm working on my newsletter and trying to level up the **visual content** around investing.
* I picked the **gaming industry** 🕹️— one of the stronger-performing megatrend pockets in the market.
* I've made a couple of **industry maps** 🗺️ to help make sense of it.
* Personally, I like the depth of **Map 1**, but I also created a **simpler version (Map 2)** for a quick overview.
* **I'd love your feedback** — what's missing, what's overkill, what you'd change.
* I'm also thinking about a benchmarking slide deck: revenue growth, margins, ROIC, and shareholder returns.
* There's a ton of great content out there — deep-dive writeups, podcasts, CEO interviews. I might curate the best stuff — would that be useful?
* What else do you think would help retail or professional investors get a better grip on this space?
* I plan to cover other industries that benefit from secular tailwinds using the same framework, so I want to make sure it's actually useful and relevant.

post,1kqq4o9,,EV’s have been taking off in my city and I finally figured out why,"I live in a pretty rural area of western Pennsylvania and after paying a bit of attention to the specific cars around me, I got a good idea of how many EV’s were in my city. Outside of my own I had only ever really seen a couple Tesla’s but they weren’t popular. Less than 10, probably closer to 5 throughout the city. 

Over the past year there were a couple more that popped up including an EV9, and a Nissan Ariya. I’ve seen a couple chevy’s, both Blazers and equinox, and even a mustang. But the last couple months they’ve exploded. In My neighborhood there are 4 prologues out of nowhere. They’re easy to identify since I work from home and my desk is by the window near the stop sign. I always hear them as they come to a stop (the prologues are actually pretty loud with their hums) and they’re three different colors and the fourth has a bunch of decals. I’ve also seen some new blazers around. 

I stopped in at a local shop and was talking to the owner like normal and she mentioned getting a Blazer. Last person I would’ve thought, and 70+ year old lady on the verge of retirement. I asked what made her switch and she explained. She took her ICE in to get it serviced and the dealer made a new policy. Any loaner vehicle that wasn’t kept overnight required to be an EV. She said it was the safest and most comfortable she’s ever been in a car. She said she got her car back and that’s really when she felt how much she missed the car. She went back 2 weeks later to buy what she test drove. And the family that owns the dealership she goes to also owns the Honda dealership. 

That’s the biggest obstacle. Getting people to drive one, not necessarily buy them. Obviously the end goal is to buy and get more on the road, but instead of just talk talk talk, focus on just getting people to drive one. She wasn’t encouraged to buy it, just given it for a day. And that’s likely what happened with a lot of the prologues. GM and Honda are massive brands and have a lot of brand loyalty.",2261,True,1747696292.0,2025-05-20 01:11:32,1787,516,Buckles01,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kqq4o9/evs_have_been_taking_off_in_my_city_and_i_finally/,True,0.98,2025,tesla,top,False,False,0,

post,1ktchqb,,The Lamborghini of Nauru's Police Chief?,"Seeking information regarding a Lamborghini reportedly located on the island nation of Nauru near Australia.

During a period of economic prosperity on Nauru, a story emerged about a police chief (or official) who acquired a Lamborghini. This individual was reportedly too large to comfortably operate the vehicle.

Request: Does anyone have factual information regarding this specific Lamborghini? This includes details such as the model year, any known history, or its current status. Photographic evidence would also be of interest.

I was able to find a BBC article mentioning it from 2008 mentioning it, but that was all I was able to find. Does anyone know which model it was, or what ended up happening to it? This would have been late 70's early 80's most likely. So possibly a Countach or Jalpa.

BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) -Nvidia will launch a new artificial intelligence chipset for China at a significantly lower price than its recently restricted H20 model and plans to start mass production as early as June, sources familiar with the matter said.

The GPU or graphics processing unit will be part of Nvidia's latest generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors and is expected to be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, well below the $10,000-$12,000 the H20 sold for, according to two of the sources.

The lower price reflects its weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements.

It will be based on Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a server-class graphics processor and will use conventional GDDR7 memory instead of more advanced high bandwidth memory, the two sources said.

They added it would not use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's advanced Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology.

The new chip's price, specifications and production timing have not previously been reported.

The three sources Reuters spoke to for this article declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to media.

An Nvidia spokesperson said the company was still evaluating its ""limited"" options. ""Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China's $50 billion data center market.""

TSMC declined to comment.

China remains a huge market for Nvidia, accounting for 13% of its sales in the past financial year.",4214,True,1748099833.0,2025-05-24 17:17:13,122,16,callsonreddit,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kudzvt/nvidia_to_launch_cheaper_blackwell_ai_chip_for/,True,0.89,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

**Key Takeaways**

* Nvidia's scheduled earnings Wednesday highlight the tech financial reports calendar this week, along with quarterly updates from Salesforce, Marvell Technologies, Dell, and HP. Other noteworthy reports expected include retailers Costco, AutoZone, and Dick’s Sporting Goods.
* Friday’s PCE inflation report will provide insight into price pressure in April, while investors will also be following updates to first-quarter GDP, the U.S. trade balance, and consumer confidence.
* Federal Reserve officials set to speak this week include Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller and New York Fed President John Williams, coming as the Fed is scheduled to release the minutes from its May meeting.

Nvidia (NVDA) earnings and a key inflation report highlight this week’s holiday-shortened calendar as investors continue to evaluate the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and economic policies.

Tech companies Salesforce (CRM), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Dell Technologies (DELL), and HP (HPQ) are expected to deliver earnings this week. Market watchers will also be looking for reports from retailers Costco Wholesale (COST), AutoZone (AZO), Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS), and Temu parent PDD Holdings (PDD).

The reports are set to arrive after a down week for stocks, which was punctuated Friday by a revival of trade-related uncertainty. You can recap last week's trading here.

In addition to Friday's personal consumption expenditures inflation report on Friday, investors will also be tuned into first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) updates and the latest data on the U.S. trade balance and retail inventories. Consumer confidence and sentiment surveys also will be in focus.

Several Fed officials are on the speaking calendar, including Federal Reserve Gov.",7347,True,1748178984.0,2025-05-25 15:16:24,66,4,callsonreddit,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kv2as8/what_to_expect_in_the_markets_this_week_may_2730/,True,0.91,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

I'm biased, but I see new C3 footage, I post. TFLclassics has a very base spec early C3, which is an interesting car to look at. It only has a 327ci V8 rated at 300hp gross, mated to a 3-speed manual, which probably gives it acceleration figures comparable to the later gas crisis cars. That being said, definitely still a fun car to cruise around in, and the input points are very positive in these old C3s. Throttle response, shift-feel, steering, braking, etc. actually feel really good in good condition cars. It reminds me of my reaction the first time I used the brakes on my '80. It felt so positive, like it was happy to stop you at any speed... up until the low traction of the crappy BFG radial T/As locked up.

Yeah, Tesla’s talking a big game with Full Self-Driving, robotaxis, and household robots. Cool stuff, but it's all *future*. Meanwhile, their core EV business? Slipping. Q1 deliveries were the worst in over two years (337k), and they’re losing global market share. Stock's riding on promises

Then there’s BYD. Not as flashy, but they’re dominating China 34% of the NEV market in 2024, $107B in revenue (more than Tesla!), and some insane charging tech (250 miles in 5 minutes?!). Plus, their cars are affordable. Under $10K for an EV? That’s game-changing

Sure, BYD isn’t as far along with FSD, but they’re investing $14B into making smarter cars. And the stock’s trading at a sane valuation (under 27x earnings). Tesla? Still moon-high

**SAVINGS**  
*\*I benchmarked the fuel costs associated against my prior car, a Toyota Corolla which got 33.17 mpg over the 100,000+ miles I tracked it, and I also benchmarked against current gas prices, which in my area have been roughly $3/gallon but I am using nuanced* [*monthly averages for my state*](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM_EPMRU_PTE_NUS_DPG&f=W)*. I also bake in a $30 oil change per 5,000 miles as ""fuel"".* 

*\*\*I also calculated the portion of my savings that is due to taxes I'm not paying at the pump (0.285+0.184 per gallon) - which is relevant politically given we can expect a $250/year EV surcharge to attempt to ""close that loophole"", which for me, looks to be ""fair"" if it were state + federal, but just being federal and* combine*d with my state's surcharge ($75), it is not.* 

I have insurance, tabs, depreciation, maintenance, as well but wanted to focus on ""fuel"". Those costs are all higher than the Corolla due to the Tesla (and Bolt) being much newer cars (and fully insured instead of minimally insured) and the heightened costs do offset the fuel-savings for now. I'll be curious to see over 100,000+ miles how the total cost to own tightens up and I expect the Tesla to win out.

post,1kwfw8y,,BYD outsells Tesla in Europe for the first time as registrations surge in April,"Tesla reported another monthly drop in April, with total volumes down 49% year on year. In contrast, BYD saw an increase of 359% over the same period thanks to its broad and competitive line up of fully electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. BYD’s rapid expansion has already pushed it ahead of established European car brands – outselling Fiat, Dacia, and Seat in the UK; Fiat and Seat in France; Seat in Italy; and Fiat in Spain. This growth comes even before production begins at its new plant in Hungary.

post,1kwjdmm,,TSLA: Why I'm still bullish despite the EPS nosedive,"Been holding TSLA since 2021 and just watched their recent earnings with mixed feelings. While everyone's freaking out about the 53% EPS drop, I've been trying to make sense of why the stock is still up 37% over the same period. Either I'm missing something or the market is.

My position: 120 shares @ $187 average (up about 81% total)

The Q1 earnings were objectively bad

EPS of $0.27 vs expected $0.41 (missed by 34%)

Factory changeovers for Model Y killed production numbers

Automotive margins down to 19% from previous highs in the mid-20s

Musk sounding increasingly distracted on the call

Yet I'm still holding and even added 15 shares on the post-earnings dip. Here's why:

The energy business is quietly becoming a monster

While everyone obsesses over car deliveries, Tesla's energy storage business hit record gross profit with 26% margins. My brother works in commercial solar, and he says Megapack orders are backlogged for months. The margins here are substantially better than automotive, and it's growing faster.

The robotaxi bet could pay off big

I was skeptical about the robotaxi timeline until I saw the Austin test videos. If they actually launch paid rides next month as planned, it changes everything about the valuation model. Even if it's limited geographically, proving the technology works would be massive.

Optimus robot could be the sleeper hit

The Optimus humanoid robot is another wild card that could transform Tesla's business model. They're planning to have thousands of units in production by year-end, ramping to potentially a million units annually by 2030.

post,1kwrt8l,,New 3-row EV comparison,"Below is the summary by Google NotebookLM

* **Kia EV9**
   * **Price:** Starts at $54,900, or basically $55,000, making it the cheapest and best value vehicle in the three-row segment. The as-tested price of the specific model shown was just over $70,000, around $72,000. You can get the Land trim with a large battery pack and dual motor for this price. Leasing is also mentioned as very cheap, around $299 per month with about $2500 down (taxes included in Colorado).
   * **Range:** The video mentions the EPA rated range is put up. The large battery pack is almost 100 kilowatt hours. The range is described as ""not all that much,"" just under 100 kilowatt hours, but considered an ""easy justification"" for the price.
   * **Charging Performance:** Charging performance is noted as being good due to its EGMP platform. The peak charging speed is about 220 kW briefly, but most of the time it's about 200 kW, and it holds this speed deep into the pack, sitting at just about 200 kW up to 80%. This makes it an amazing charging vehicle for road trips. However, it's the only vehicle in the comparison that doesn't natively interface well with the Tesla Supercharger network, getting a maximum of 84 kW currently, though this is expected to increase to 125 kW for model year 2026. It uses an onboard booster for Supercharging and can be buggy.
* **Cadillac Vistic**
   * **Price:** Described as ""quite a bit more money than the Kia,"" starting around $80,000 base, with the as-tested model around $84,000. Higher trims can go up to $100,000.
   * **Range:** Shares the Lyric battery, which GM quotes as 102 kilowatt hours capacity, though it's closer to 105-106 kWh. The battery capacity is only about 10 to 20 kWh more than the smaller Equinox and Optic, which feels like a lot of money for the battery size in a large car.

I sent in a service request and received an invoice for $205. Looking on third-party sites, I can find OEM headrests for ~$50 and can easily replace it myself. However, this OEM number is 1623801-00-A. The OEM part for the headrest that Tesla quoted me was 1623798-91-C.

Again doing research, I cannot find much difference between these OEM parts. Both appear to fit my 2021 MY. It appears the Tesla quoted OEM would include abilities for “special features”? I am not sure what special features would be included in my headrest.

Has anyone else who has upgraded to a 2026 Model Y while keeping their older Model Y experienced this? I'm wondering if it's due to differences in the seat design or the reclining mechanism between the two. The steering wheel position seems to sync just fine, but the seat position, particularly the recline, feels off way off, this is vice versa because if I change the position in the 2021 it's much closer position to the steering wheel in the 2026.

post,1kx4kb9,,Model 3 HW4 FSD Software Crashes and AP Critical Alerts. Any experience or advice?,"I wanted to get some input from you guys related to an issue I've been having with my 2024 Model 3 to see if anyone else has experienced my issue and if so, what did Tesla do to resolve it:

  
Over the past several months, I've had an intermittent issue where I'll be using FSD and the car will start alarming and saying to take over immediately followed by ""Autopilot aborted due to system error"". It then takes 5 or so minutes for it to come back online. At first, I brushed it off as a bug in the software, but it became more frequent and recently went as far as braking to a stop and putting itself in park in the middle of a highway.

  
What's odd is that after it does its reboot, there are no lingering user facing errors or notifications to get the vehicle serviced. In service mode the main alert showing up is APS\_w159\_apbCritical which states ""*Autopilot Processor Secondary (APS) detects that the Autopilot Processor Backup (APB) is not functioning as expected, making Autopilot (AP) features unavailable.""* 

  
I've already made a service appointment, but the Tesla service technician seemed to be dismissive of there being a real problem and scheduled me pretty far out. My concern is that this seems to keep happening on multiple software versions and does not seem to be a common error other drivers are reporting. The most info I can find seems to revolve around the 2024 holiday update bricking model 3s built in the same month mine was, but I had no issue with the update and my car does not completely loose FSD/AP after rebooting like other cars did.

  
If anyone can give any anecdotal experience with a similar issue and/or advice on handling the service appointment, I'd greatly appreciate it!",1723,False,1748395389.0,2025-05-28 03:23:09,1,3,Isotopicgoose,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kx4kb9/model_3_hw4_fsd_software_crashes_and_ap_critical/,True,0.6,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

I’m looking into buying a used Model 3 or Model Y here in Dallas, TX, and wanted to see if anyone could share some advice or experiences.

A few things I’d love input on:
1. Any thoughts on which one makes more sense for Texas driving? 
2. Anything I should check for when it comes to battery health or specific model years to avoid?
3. Does the Tesla warranty still apply if I’m buying used from a third party?
4. What kind of problems have you run into?
5. How does adding Full Self-Driving work on a used car? Can I buy it later through the app?

post,1kxf90a,,Suggestion: enable/disable accessory power via App/API,"I love that we can now enable/disable accessory power through the vehicle. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like this is possible via the [vehicle commands API](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/vehicle-commands#charge-max-range) or through the Tesla App itself. My use case: I have a battery-powered (independent of the vehicle HV/LV batteries) Dashcam that charges via the onboard 12V when I'm driving the car. 



Unfortunately, during long absences between driving / very short drives, I'm not able to charge the battery enough to get a reliable 12 - 14 hours of standby recording. I could leave the setting on permanently but this is wasteful and results in significantly higher idle-power usage. 



Ideally, I'd like a setting where I could have 12V power for 1-2 hours (enough to charge the battery, and then shutoff). Rivian has a feature like this and I've found it super helpful. It would also be cool to enable this as an API command and then use Tessie to trigger automations.



Why do I use an external dashcam? The optical quality of Blackvue dashcams is superior to Tesla's cameras and this has allowed me to capture license plate details where Tesla's built-in cameras have failed. I also like the fact that the front lens features a 136 degree wide horizontal capture angle, which allows me to get more of the road.

Both (1) and (3) represent a significant modification from the previous text. It looks like you'll have to submit some paperwork to do.

(3) Makes it unclear to me what actual benefit this bill will have if it gets passed. This gives the department (DMV) significant leeway to prescribe emissions standards that could really moot the whole point of the bill. We may not have a good idea what those will be until this is actually implemented, but I'm not overwhelmingly hopeful given the history of this kind of thing.

post,1kxsby5,,"Tesla targets June 12 launch for robotaxi service in Austin, Bloomberg News reports","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-targets-june-12-launch-204524186.html

(Reuters) -Tesla is poised to begin its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin on June 12, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The date has been discussed internally and could still change, the report added.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Earlier this month, CEO Elon Musk said the EV maker is set to begin a test of its long-promised robotaxi service on schedule in Austin, Texas, by the end of June.

A successful robotaxi trial is crucial for Tesla as Musk has shifted the company's focus away from building a new, cheaper EV platform to launching the robotaxi service and its Optimus humanoid robots. Much of Tesla's valuation hangs on that bet.

Tesla sales have fallen worldwide with rising competition and as Musk faces a backlash for his political views and his role as an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump.

I’m fine with buying a full-size aftermarket wheel if needed. (I’ve heard 19"" wheels can work) but I want to make sure whatever I get fits properly, especially with the Performance model’s larger brakes.

Also, I’ve seen a few posts mention something about a locator bolt or retention bolt that might need to be removed for certain aftermarket wheels or spare tires to fit. Can anyone confirm that or explain what I’d need to do?

post,1kxu7oq,,First-Time EV Buyer's Guide,"I often help people on the weekly General Questions and Purchasing Advice thread, and have been thinking about doing something like this to compile my answers to common questions. I'm going to structure it like a guide for each part of the buying process, but it's more like a collection of my thoughts. I'd be happy to add to it if anyone has anything else to contribute! This is also US-centric (sorry). 

#The Starting Line
So you want to buy an EV eh? Awesome! The process is, in general, very similar to buying a standard internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, but with a few key additional areas of research. I'm going to assume you generally know the basics of ICE vehicle ownership, and make this guide as specific as possible the electric portion of the vehicle purchasing. 

Let me say this up top though if you are on the fence for an EV. If you can charge at home and have a two-car (or more) household, you 100% should make one of those cars an EV. You'll save money on gas and oil changes, and experience the convenience of leaving home with a full ""tank"" every morning. You can get a used Chevy Bolt or Tesla for less than $10k almost anywhere in the US if you qualify for the $4k tax credit, and they're great vehicles that can completely cover 99% of driving needs (and obviously there's plenty of vehicles at higher prices). If that's all you need to hear, go for it. 

# Assess your situation
As always you should buy a car that suits your needs. Trucks for construction work, vans for families, etc. EVs are no different, but you should ask yourself a few additional questions to determine which, if any, EV is right for you: 

* The first, most important question - do you have a place to charge? The main benefit EV owners cite is that the vehicle can ""refuel"" at home, every night. In contrast, the ""worst"" part of the experience is public charging.",15761,True,1748470421.0,2025-05-29 00:13:41,88,53,chilidoggo,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kxu7oq/firsttime_ev_buyers_guide/,True,0.96,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kxwjdj,,Tesla investors demand Musk work 40-hour week at EV maker as ‘crisis’ builds,"Elon Musk needs to spend more time at Tesla as his electric vehicle company faces a “crisis,” according to a letter on Wednesday from a group of pension fund leaders who manage investments in the company.

“Tesla’s stock price volatility, declining sales, as well as disconcerting reports regarding the company’s human rights practices, and a plummeting global reputation are cause for serious concern,” the investors wrote in a letter to Robyn Denholm, the company’s board chair. “Moreover, many issues are linked to Mr. Musk’s actions outside of his role as Technoking and Chief Executive Officer at Tesla, including his high-profile role as an architect of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).”

The investors want the Tesla board to require Musk to work a minimum of 40 hours per week at the automaker as a condition of any new compensation plan they may arrange for him. They also want a clear succession plan for management of the EV business, and a policy that would apply to all Tesla directors limiting their outside board commitments at public and private companies.

Early last year, the Delaware Court of Chancery ordered Tesla to rescind Musk’s 2018 CEO pay package, which had been worth around $56 billion, finding that Musk controlled the company, and the board’s compensation committee misled shareholders before seeking their vote to approve the plan.

Musk now says he wants even more shares, amounting to 25% voting control of the company.

Tesla’s brand value and reputation have declined since 2024, due largely to Musk’s incendiary rhetoric and political activities. In addition to pouring nearly $300 million into an effort to get Donald Trump back into the White House, Musk formally endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party ahead of the country’s parliamentary election this year.

post,1ky8r5u,,NY Times: Export Controls Are Endangering the Fragile U.S.-China Truce,"Just two-and-a-half weeks after agreeing to suspend tariffs, both countries are using export controls to disrupt each other’s key industries.

After stepping back this month from an escalating and dangerous war of tariffs, the United States and China are now threatening to undermine their uneasy truce.

On May 12, the countries announced after weekend meetings in Geneva that they would suspend most of their recently imposed tariffs. Since then, however, both governments have shown that they are still prepared to wield controls over critical exports as weapons against one another, with moves that are potentially even more damaging to trade and global supply chains.

China has restricted its exports of rare earth magnets, which are crucial for cars, semiconductors, aircraft and many other applications. Close to 90 percent of the world’s rare earth metals, including magnets, are produced in China.

And the United States on May 13 banned the latest semiconductors from Huawei, a Chinese electronics giant. Then on Wednesday, President Trump suspended the shipment of American semiconductors and some aerospace equipment needed for China’s commercial aircraft, the C919, a signature project in China’s push toward economic self-reliance.

The increasing use of export controls by both countries amounts to supply chain warfare, interrupting the flow of key components that the other country must have to operate huge industries that employ large numbers of workers.

Last week, Ford Motor temporarily closed a factory in Chicago that makes Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles after one of its suppliers ran out of the magnets. In most new cars, the magnets are used in dozens of electric motors that operate brake and steering systems, fuel injectors and even power seats.

Which way do you think I should go?

1. Tesla Wall Connector with NACS only and then use the A2Z adapter with the Bolt.

post,1kyl4rv,,Question about Tesla Cars,"Hello,

I’d like to start this off by saying that I have this problem where people keep hitting my car. Doesn’t matter if I’m stopped at a red light or just driving in my own lane. Somehow, people keep hitting me. I haven’t been at fault for any of these incidents so far. I’m pretty fed up with this because I’ve had my car for less than one year and it has been hit three times. I don’t even live in a big city. 

So, my question is: will a Tesla alert me if another car makes contact with mine, even if it’s just a really small bump? 

In one of the incidents I had, I was on a busy highway, stopped at a red light. I noticed the person behind me was super close to me but my car didn’t move and I didn’t hear a sound (my window was down) so I drove off. Later I checked and there was a dent in my car where the person hit me.

post,1kyld3i,,New vehicle purchase - check my gas/kWh math please,"TLDR: upgrading from a 35mpg (city) 2nd gen Prius to PHEV or EV, think either one will save us in the long run as gasoline costs increase here in California, but based on my math it is not looking feasible. I need some input if my math needs to account for other factors. 

For context, my wife has a 2007 Prius that's reliable but showing its age. Haven't done much highway driving lately but have been tracking the last few fuel purchases of mostly city driving and it seems to be getting about 35mpg lately. Regular 87 octane is holding at around $4/gallon. So approx 11.4 cents per mile for fuel only (not including maintenance, etc).
Central Valley CA. We are expected to see gas in the $6-8 range within the next 2 years due to refineries shutting down permanently, unless there is some course correction with the political winds.

Our goal in a new vehicle is to upgrade from what we currently have and have a vehicle that is good for long trips. We think PHEV is the ideal candidate. It would allow efficient daily commute use, but still have the engine and tank to take us anywhere on longer trips like we currently use her car or my truck (400-500 mile range) without having to deal with the range anxiety or charging times of a full EV. 

I'm learning to look past the MPGe number and look more closely at the specs, since MPGe is an average formula based on average driver use case scenario. 
Learning to ask: what is the MPG of the gas powertrain that will take us on longer trips, and what is the kWh/100 mile number.

Example a new Kia Sorento or Sportage PHEV have 31/34 miles of EV range respectively, and approx 34-36mpg gas, but a Mazda CX90 has 26 miles of battery range and only gets 26mpg gas. These are just a few PHEV models we have considered. 
Digging deeper, the kWh/100 mile ratings:
Kia Sportage PHEV 40
Kia Sorento PHEV 45
Mazda CX-90 PHEV 58

We do not currently have solar, it is in the future plans, so for now just paying straight PG&E rates on a tiered rate plan.",3710,True,1748550691.0,2025-05-29 22:31:31,2,51,keepcalmandcarryone,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kyld3i/new_vehicle_purchase_check_my_gaskwh_math_please/,True,0.57,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

Tesla seems to have quietly killed the web setup process for Wall Connectors. If you're stuck with the “Download the Tesla One App” message at [192.168.92.1](http://192.168.92.1), stop wasting time. Download the *Tesla One* app, select “External Partner,” enter your Wall Connector serial manually, and use Setup Mode (blinking green) to reconfigure your unit.

\--

Alright Reddit — if you’re trying to reconfigure your Gen 3 Tesla Wall Connector (like resetting it or changing the breaker size), and all you’re getting is the “Tesla One App – Partner Access Only” screen at [`http://192.168.92.1`](http://192.168.92.1), here’s what actually worked for me after way too much trial and error. Tesla has changed how commissioning works, and most of the info online is now outdated.

# What You’ll Need:

* Tesla One App (not the regular Tesla app)
* Wall Connector serial number (usually on the back of the unit, behind the cover)
* A Tesla account (yes, even if you don’t own a Tesla)
* Your Wi-Fi password
* A little patience

# Steps to Reset or Recommission:

1. Download the **Tesla One App**
2. Choose **External Partner** when prompted
3. Log in or create a Tesla account
4. Tap: *Installs → Continue → Go to Home*
5. Tap **Begin Install**
6. Choose **Enter Connector Info Manually**
7. Type in your unit’s serial number
8. Put your Wall Connector into setup mode by holding the charging handle button for \~6 seconds until the LED blinks green
9. Tap **Join** when prompted
10. Follow the rest of the prompts:

* Set country
* Adjust breaker size (e.g., 50A sets output to 40A)
* Connect to Wi-Fi

I’m not an electrician — just a guy trying not to burn down the garage. My setup was wired to code for a 60A breaker, pulling 48A no problem.

post,1kyrdrn,,Thinking of buying a used Tesla — need input from long-time owners,"I recently test drove a few Teslas and instantly fell in love. Like many others have said, it completely changes how you view driving.

As much as I’d love to get a brand-new model (especially after experiencing HW4), my current financial situation only allows me to consider something from around 2018–2022 — ideally a 2019 or 2020 model.

So I have a few questions for those of you who own older Teslas:
	1.	Do you regularly use FSD (Full Self-Driving), or is it not really up to par with HW4, making you take over more often?
	2.	How many miles do you have on your car?
	3.	Is the claim that Tesla batteries can last up to 500k miles actually holding up for anyone here?

I know jumping into this might seem impulsive, but the experience genuinely changed my perspective — and the money saved on gas and oil changes is very appealing.

post,1kyshf0,,"Multiple cars, different credit cards for Supercharger cost.","I cannot seem to figure out how to get the following situation to work. I have 3 Teslas on my account, I have 3 drivers, wife, daughter and myself. Everyone has their own Tesla account and I have invited everyone to drive, so they can all drive any car. Daughter has her own credit card and wants to pay for the supercharging when she is driving her M3 (one of the 3 cars). On her phone, she has added her credit card details to account -> Wallet and there is no other payment options. But when she charges, it still charges my credit card. 

Should this work this way or will all 3 cars always charge the ""owners"" credit card?
