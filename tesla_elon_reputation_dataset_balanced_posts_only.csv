post,5yptnc,,Best Tech Stocks to Buy in 2017,"Tech stocks record the highest potential of growth, which is natural considering the Internet of Things movement and the continuously spreading wireless cloud.I am going to outline a few of the stocks which are my potential investments in various technology branches for 2017.

* Starting with entertainment, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) seems like a worthy stock to buy this year as analysts predict a growth of 24% during this time. What gives Netflix a reliable backing is the subscribing structure. Not only is it increasing exceedingly, but the customers tend to be long term rather than one time buyers.

* As for automobiles, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) shows numerous proofs that this year the company is going to outperform the market. The underlying idea that ensures Tesla a successful year is their open attitude for innovation and revolution. Their new project, the Autopilot, is one of the reasons why I predict an upside. Additionally, their collaboration with Google makes 2017 even more promising.

* The last entry is Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ: ADBE). As last year performance is a crucial metric, we must not undermine Adobe which had a 5.8 billion total income in 2016. However, i would say that ADBE is even more prolific as a long term investment as it tends to show tiny upside and downside fluctuations during the quarter, but keeps an ascending tendency speaking on long run.


In the final analysis, this year is going to be life changing for most of the companies because of the unprecedented political and financial events. That is why I would like to hear more experienced traders’ opinion on the stocks I have chosen. What other stocks would you recommend?",1682,False,1489191714.0,2017-03-11 01:21:54,9,12,TheBinaryAdvisor,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/5yptnc/best_tech_stocks_to_buy_in_2017/,True,0.77,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known for short bursts of activity on Twitter, oftentimes answering fans and reporters questions on the social media platform.

On Friday, as Musk was on a flight to Cape Canaveral—presumably to attend to business related to SpaceX, the aerospace company he also runs—the billionaire entrepreneur shared a number of new details about the Model 3, a video, and even the solar roof tiles Tesla plans to sell.

Here’s what we learned:

First the basics, Musk wanted to clarify that Model 3 is not simply a next version of a Tesla.

He later got more specific about the Model 3 in response to several questions from the above tweet.

- It will have Autopilot capabilities, which has been shared before.
- It will still be awesome. When asked Musk’s reply was “definitely.”
- Musk then added the Model 3 will be like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. “Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot,” he tweeted.
- It should be able to fit a large cooler in the trunk of the Model 3 (a response a concern about trunk space in sedans).
- It won’t contain any significantly new technology that has yet to be introduced to the S or X. Musk says there’s lots of new tech in the design and production process, but nothing “majorly new that a consumer would notice.”
- The shorter wheelbase of the Model 3 only allows for a 75 kilowatt-hour battery pack in Model 3. But, that doesn’t mean it won’t have a greater range than the Chevy Bolt EV, which can travel 238 miles on a single charge.

post,6op4w4,,Investing Philosophy,"For the past year, I've been building a new web application that tracks and analyzes my stock portfolio.  I know there are a lot of tools out there, but I've never really loved any of them.  So I set out to build my own.  The thing is, it's based on my investing philosophy, and I'd like to get your feedback on my philosophy because that will help shape the web application as I continue to develop it.  Please read on...

As a personal investor, every time you invest money in the stock market, you essentially choose one of two options:

Option #1 is to find a great company and purchase some stock.  You monitor the company and decide when to sell based on company performance, market conditions, changes in leadership, the company’s financials, and so much more…  Generally, that’s us – we are personal investors.

Option #2 is to simply buy a low-cost index fund or ETF that guarantees a return essentially equal to the market or whatever benchmark you choose (most commonly the S&P 500).

Why do some people choose option #2?  It turns out, those benchmarks outperform most mutual funds and many individual investors, and they don’t require any of the work involved in managing your own portfolio! 

So, here’s the thing: it’s easy to buy shares of an index fund or ETF and match the market’s returns (letting your portfolio grow on autopilot) but it’s quite difficult to actually beat the market. 

Nevertheless, that doesn’t stop us individual investors from finding that diamond in the rough…that next great company that will change the world, crush its competitors, and enrich our personal portfolios.

*My point is this:  Individual investors are not just trying to make money.  The goal is to make more money than what an index fund or ETF would return...the goal is to beat the market.  We want validation that all this hard work is paying off, that we're making the right decisions, and we are indeed outperforming the S&P 500 (or whatever benchmark you prefer).",2393,True,1500655479.0,2017-07-21 18:44:39,2,7,BuckM11,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/6op4w4/investing_philosophy/,True,0.75,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,704r6z,,Why Teslas range extended during pre hurricane.,"So I guess what I'm asking is,
If Tesla cars have the extended range within them in the first place, why does it have to be overridden by the company in a time of crisis? Doesn't it seem sort of scummy for Tesla to limit their vehicles to make customers charge more? 
God forbid someone got caught in a desert or something with no charging station. Their vehicle technically has distance 'left' until it's 'dead' but you'd be stranded. 

I generally like Elon Musk and what he is doing for technology. 

I am just trying get grasp the why behind the whole range extended thing.

With those efforts still in progress, it is setting out on another quest: to remake the multibillion-dollar trucking industry.

In an elaborately produced nighttime presentation by its chief executive, Elon Musk, Tesla unveiled a prototype for a battery-powered, nearly self-driving semi truck that the company said would prove more efficient and less costly to operate than the diesel trucks that now haul goods across the country. And of course, it will emit no exhaust.

In Tesla fashion, the truck is a sharp departure from the industry’s norm. The cabin is spacious enough for a driver and passenger to stand. The driver’s seat is in the center of the cab, not on the left side. It is flanked by two laptop-size video screens providing navigation and scheduling data as well as images from blind spots and other areas around the truck.

It will be equipped with radar sensors, cameras and processors to enable drivers to use a version of Autopilot, the advanced driver-assistance system featured in Tesla cars such as the Model S and the new Model 3.""

post,7du8rv,,Get me up to speed on investing in TSLA,"I am not super educated on the Tesla-sphere and, I'm not in the shipping industry, so some advice from ""experts"" there would be appreciated. I was doing my research, and noticing the dip in price after I saw the Semi announcement. Now, when I saw that I was stunned as I'm sure many of you were. I immediately think to myself, this will change the world entirely. [Then I saw that Walmart will be ordering 15 units for testing](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/17/wal-mart-says-its-planning-to-test-teslas-new-electric-trucks.html) and got even more interested. I knew I had wished I invested in TSLA long ago before I started investing a little bit of money, and I simply could not afford to. Now with this release, I just wonder how this could NOT be the future? With the benefits listed, I can't imagine why a company wouldn't want this truck, as it is currently today. The cost savings alone seem to ensure that this is not only the best truck you can buy.. but possibly the cheapest truck you can buy. It appears possible that this could reduce shipping costs up to 50% (truck costs).

&nbsp;

Then I read about their **[production problems](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16627528/tesla-perbix-acquisition-automated-factory-machine-builds-machines), [their missed deadlines with feature releases](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/24/16504038/tesla-autopilot-self-driving-update-elon-musk), and [financial issues](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16593582/tesla-model-3-production-q3-largest-quarterly-loss).**

&nbsp;

If this semi is the gift from the gods it appears to be, perhaps that would solve their financial issues, but could they even produce them with the production issues they are having today? And what's with the lack of updates? Apparently, the autopilot isn't quite what it was advertised to be.",3288,True,1511025452.0,2017-11-18 18:17:32,0,21,Ampix0,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/7du8rv/get_me_up_to_speed_on_investing_in_tsla/,True,0.47,2017,both,search,False,False,0,

Is that even possible given how much it's grown this past year? I think so. 


I'm just going to go over some catalysts and some risks:


Catalysts


* New GeForce series using the new Volta architecture, Series 20. Announcement will be big, should be in March 2018. The already released GPUs with Volta have been successful, I expect that trend to continue.


* Cryptocurrency becoming more popular. Crypto isn't going away, so I'd assume it to be a catalyst. I don't like to pay attention to it. 


* Two years until we are seeing some of Nvidia's big autonmous vehicles come to life. Both the driving platform they are developing in china with ZF and Baidu, and the Volkswagen VW AI-infused Bus are expected to be actualized in 2020. If we see some success in the execution of these projects, I'd consider it a catalyst. I'm confident their execution will be successful given the success they've already demonstrated in AI with their datacenter revenue.


* Gaming industry big news (PC). Every year there is more gamers, every year gamers get better jobs, every year there are more games. GPUs are an integral part to gaming, so these revenues will grow with the gaming market.


Risks:


* Semiconductor industry decline. The semiconductor industry is interesting because a decline in one can cause they others to underperform. This is an entire topic on its own.

> Tesla Inc. late Friday acknowledged its semiautonomous system Autopilot was engaged by the driver in the seconds before a fatal crash last week, raising more questions about the safety of self-driving technology on public roads.

> Federal investigators this week began examining the March 23 crash of a Model X sport-utility vehicle that was traveling south on Highway 101, near Mountain View, Calif., before it struck a barrier, then was hit by two other vehicles and caught fire. The driver of the Model X was killed.

> Tesla said its vehicle logs show the driver’s hands weren’t detected on the wheel for six seconds before the collision, and he took no action despite having five seconds and about 500 feet of unobstructed view of a concrete highway divider.

post,8oq5ch,,What are things you look for in a company when investing? (Why is telsa good or bad),"Im in college working pt , I save half my paychecks and put a fourth towards stocks. I just bought 5  stocks of Tesla a month ago at 291 because (this was my thought process ...not claiming it was the right one..) theres an insane demand, cult following,  and at this point their too big to fail. I brushed off the burning through cash issue because of the demand and assumed they'd find a way to fill it soon enough. And I think the autopilot crashes are not too bad considering there's probably thousands of car crashes every day. The stock dropped 20$ immediately after I bought it and keeps fluctuating and is back to where I bought it at. I plan on keeping the stock for a few years but I was wondering what's causing the constant up and down, and also what are some solid points I could look at to get a better prediction of how to stock will do? Because what my points feel like guesses. Also I noticed many auto makers stocks are stagnant. Why would that be? Also why is Tesla 10-30× other car company stocks?

post,8zef4k,,Longtime muscle car guy and r/cars reader's thoughts on a weekend with a Tesla Model 3,"As a lifelong car guy, one of my foundational rules is that if someone offers me time behind the wheel of something I've never driven before, be it an econobox or an exotic, I take it. I may lend up liking it, I may not, but at least I can say I've driven it. It was with this mindset that I said ""yes"" when a friend offered to let me babysit his Tesla Model 3 while he was away for a weekend.  As I find many of the critics on here seem to have never actually driven a Model 3 for an extended period, I thought I'd offer my longtime car guy thoughts.  I'm also not looking to debate aspects of Tesla's cult, or Elon Musk as a person; this is about a car.

The car in question was a Rear Wheel Drive Model 3, with the (currently mandatory) premium upgrade package, upgraded battery, and Autopilot.  First thing I noticed is that the Model 3, while not as pretty as the Model S, does look better in person than in photos, although that's not saying much.  I poked the awkward fulcrum-based, different-for-the-sake-of-being-different door handle and got in.  Seats were comfy, although the floor seemed higher than a normal car due to the batteries underneath, which made it tough to find a comfortable seating position.

I'll save the missives about no-dashboard-screen-only argument and just say that during the day, I got used to having to look over to get my speed without much issue.  Climate controls were anchored to the bottom of the main screen such that I could safely adjust the temperature while driving, while other simple things were reserved for redlights.  And while the blank slat in front of me was less offensive than expected during the day, the one thing I didn't get used to, at all, was having just a void of darkness in front of me during nighttime driving.

Stick with me here, this is going to get a bit ""Pepperidge Farm remembers"" for a minute.

In 1861 the American Civil War began. The First Battle of Bull Run -- the inaugural conflict of the war -- took place in Manassas, Virginia, on the Yorkshire Plantation owned by Wilmer McLean. 

The battle shook Wilmer and his family and they moved from their plantation to escape being further embroiled in the war; in 1863, the McLean family moved to a remote area some 120 miles away. 


In 1865 after a bloody struggle that cleaved the nation and forever altered its genetic and political legacy, Robert E. Lee was prepared surrender to Ulysses S. Grant. Over the past four years the war had seen action all across what was then United States territory and ended in Appomattox, Virginia.


A messenger was dispatched from Appomattox Courthouse to find a suitable location for the signing of the treaty that would end the war. The messenger imposed upon the first house he saw and begged the owner to host the historic meeting.


This house, by pure coincidence, was owned and occupied by one Wilmer McLean and family. He reluctantly agreed to host the signing and is quoted as having said, ""The war began in my front yard and ended in my front parlor.""

After the signing, many of the people present essentially ransacked McLean's house and gave him small change for the furniture which was now ""historic"" because it had been in the parlor for the surrender of the Confederacy. 

As the conversation regarding Tesla in particular and electric vehicles in general becomes more pitched, we're finding that **r/cars is becoming the Yorkshire Plantation of this particular engagement and the regular users here are feeling more and more like Wilmer McLean.",4268,True,1535638382.0,2018-08-30 16:13:02,331,165,brandonsmash,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/9bjyvb/a_new_approach_to_teslamuskelectric_vehicle/,True,0.94,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

post,9kobe4,,Are the short sellers running a campaign to lower TSLA stock price?,"I am pissed about how Elon Musk is being treated. Am I not getting it, or is this how it is?

Here is my semi-informed opinion. 

&#x200B;

Elon Musk and Tesla Motors have done amazing things so far. They have revolutionized vehicle design and manufacturing in a very short time, and singlehandedly created the market for electric cars.  


At Tesla, he set seemingly impossible goal and consistently meets it, although usually a little later than his original ambitious plan.  


They have revolutionized the auto industry and vehicle design, and are now about to earn more revenue than they are reinvesting in new vehicle design and their charging infrastructure.

&#x200B;

After a nine-month delay, they are finally meeting their ambitious production targets for the Model 3 (estimated at 53,000 for the third quarter 2018 vs 50,000 to 55,000 target).  


So, Tesla and Musk obviously deserve to be celebrated for a stunning victory for American design and manufacturing.  


But instead, they are being hounded by media, wall street and the SEC.  


That's because some very powerful people bet against Tesla, and don't want to lose money. So, they are using the government people and media that they own to bring down the company.  


If they succeed, the next American success story is less likely to happen.  


Musk and Tesla need our support.  


Reach out to your representative and Senator to let them know that you notice what the SEC is doing. Ask them why the perpetrators of the 2008 financial crisis that put about 10 million people out of jobs and their homes haven't been held accountable after 10 years, but after 1 tweet, Elon Musk has to step down from as Tesla's Chairman of the Board (and perhaps be replaced with someone of their choosing?)",1765,False,1538461591.0,2018-10-02 08:26:31,20,13,pizzamanisme,elonmusk,https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/9kobe4/are_the_short_sellers_running_a_campaign_to_lower/,True,0.87,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

post,a8m69t,,Current Investing Environment from Experiences Investor Pro/Cons - Seeking Other Experienced Investor Commentary,"Hello investor friends! I try to maintain a running list of the current economic situation at all times since I trade based on current global news.  I'm looking for some commentary on my current list:

  

**Pros**

Super cheap oil - this helps consumer spending and emerging markets, but hurts the S&P and oil exporters (a segment of the US now). Google the article “The American Consumer Is On Track To Save $40 Billion In Annual Energy Costs”. Every one cent decrease in gas prices saves the consumer $1 billion in yearly energy costs!

Corporate tax cuts are permanent unless congress repeals them - why are people under the impression that this is a one-time stimulus and will wear off?

Potential for at least a temporary trade deal and cut in tariffs to see if China makes due on its promises (my hunch)

Low unemployment - historically this means we’re closer to the next recession though

Some pockets of potential stock value

Historically low interest rates

Household debt ratio is OK

**Cons**

Trump instability.

Russia investigation. 

Strong dollar - hurts US exports and emerging markets. Where will this be in 2019?

Market pessimism and downward momentum

Global growth worries - will these prove to be well justified in affecting US corporate profits?

Yield curve is flattening, though historically it has been this flat and growth continues for years to come

Fed balance sheet unwind - Fed needs to sell lots of securities. Low treasury prices drive up safe yields and make bonds look more attractive, driving down stock prices. 

Fed raising interest rates, though rates are still low historically speaking.

QE unwind. Will bonds end up getting crushed eventually?

Trade war - who long will it go on and what will be the effect? Will Trump fold because of the stock market crashing?

Brexit

Isolationism getting popular hurting trade and the global economy

Decelerating global economy

Isn't an all-EV car supposed to be simpler to make and repair than a conventional ICE car and certainly easier than a hybrid (which has both technologies)? If I remember correctly hybrid tech became available in 1900 and some hybrid tanks were even made during WWII. The technology has been reliable and available to consumers since at least as far back as the Gen I Prius (2001). Seems to me that these days cars don't change much except in terms of gadgets and onboard 3G/4G LTE with the exception of some new transmissions being tried out (Nissan Versa CVT) and in the case of EVs new battery tech, but I don't think Musk invented any new battery tech, they just copied the most modern commercially available tech to get the most energy density. So my questions are:

1. Why are EVs still so expensive? It's literally not worth it to buy them unless you're a cab driver stuck in stand-still traffic daily.
2. Why did Musk have so much difficulty perfecting the car for the factory when logically it would seem an EV would be easier to make?
3. Why do Teslas typically have more capacity than other cars like Nissan's Leaf? Just bigger cells?",1439,False,1545610241.0,2018-12-24 01:10:41,0,15,GetInHereStalker,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/a8zuie/why_is_tesla_model_3_such_a_big_deal/,True,0.35,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

post,adxl0r,,C7 Grand Sport Owner's Review of a 2016 Tesla Model X,"So I got married this weekend and my friend decided to rent a 90D Tesla Model X for the wedding to help chauffeur family members around. I ended up driving the car for about (3) days and here are my impressions on the following: Power, Handling, Practicality, Style, Build Quality, and Overall Driving Experience. 

**Power (Powah!)** 

I drove a Model X 90D a few years ago at a Tesla dealership when looking for a new car for my dad. I was impressed with the power then, but the dealership driving experience was only about 15 minutes and was very much about showing all of the car's features so it was hard to really get a grasp for the car's power. 

In driving it around the past few days I got a much better sense of the car's power delivery and it is pretty enjoyable. 

The electric motors and AWD system give the car a near instantaneous and perfectly tractioned power delivery at all times. You put the pedal down and you begin to feel the car surge forward in proportion to how much throttle you are giving it. 

We've all heard the stories of Teslas slaying other cars in drag races and torching nearly everyone from 0-60. The 90D has a 0-60 time slated at around 4.8 seconds, which is fast but nowhere near legendary, but to be honest the car felt much stronger than that. 

A big reason for this is because the Model X doesn't have to change gears and can respond to throttle input very rapidly. Sure other cars can do 0-60 in say 4 seconds, but they have to be in the right gear, with the right surface, and with enough traction to make that pull possible. Too much throttle input and the car breaks traction, too little and you missed your shot at the perfect 4 seconds. 

With the Model X when you put your foot down the car immediately goes ""alright this is the maximum amount of power I can give you without breaking traction"" and I've never seen a car react so quickly to driver input.",28641,True,1546973685.0,2019-01-08 19:54:45,55,70,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/adxl0r/c7_grand_sport_owners_review_of_a_2016_tesla/,True,0.74,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,ap1h7u,,Why doesn't Tesla design and develop an electric replacement for the ancient USPS mail truck? (Grumman LLV),"*I'm not a massive Tesla fanboy, just thought of this and it seems to make too much sense not to share.

I'm surprised Elon or their board doesn't jump to try and develop something for what would be a sizable government contract and some welcome guaranteed income for the foreseeable future as the government would need to purchase these vehicles from Tesla (or a subsidiary so the brand isn't damaged) at a relatively constant rate as they phase out the Grumman and purchase spare parts for 20+ years.

The current mail carrier has a 200ish mile range, which I believe could be matched by an electric carrier relatively easily, plus the constant start/stop would mean regen braking could provide assistance as far as range goes.

The seemingly endless amount of torque provided by electric motors should provide enough for the payload required.

It would, theoretically, be more reliable as an electric motor has **significantly** less moving parts. The batteries could be replaced and refreshed every 5-10 years similar to what is being done now with early hybrids.

The US government would save millions in gas, oil, and various other ware components, it would be better for the environment, and a publicity win for Tesla, Musk, and the USPS.",1245,False,1549779832.0,2019-02-10 07:23:52,36,77,FondabaruCBR4_6RSAWD,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/ap1h7u/why_doesnt_tesla_design_and_develop_an_electric/,True,0.67,2019,both,search,False,False,0,

> ""It's hard to imagine the Fed sounding as dovish in the minutes, as [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell sounded in the briefing . We do think the minutes will be bearish. As far as the general tenor, it's hard to see it more dovish than it was on Jan. 30,"" said Michael Schumacher, director strategy at Wells Fargo.

> The Fed, at that meeting, held rates steady and emphasized it could pause in its rate hiking cycle. In what felt like an about face from its December meeting, Powell also emphasized that the Fed would be flexible with its balance sheet. The Fed releases the minutes of its meeting Wednesday afternoon.

> Positive comments on trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials, and a commitment to continue talks in the coming week helped boost stocks Friday and could continue to support the market in the week ahead.

The 2018 Tesla Model 3 was reportedly headed  southbound at the time that a tractor-trailer, pulling out of a driveway  leading to Pero Family Farms after stopping at a stop sign, attempted  to turn left onto the highway headed northbound. 

At that time the tractor-trailer entered the path of the Tesla, and  the latter hit the driver’s side of the trailer, “resulting in the roof  being sheared off as it passed underneath the trailer,” the report said.  The 50-year-old Tesla driver died on the scene, per Reuters. It is not  clear whether the Tesla’s Autopilot mode was active at the time of the  collision.

post,bjphfc,,I test drove A Tesla Model 3 Standard Range here is my Review.,"**Experience**: Everyone at the Jacksonville Tesla Showroom were very friendly and they appreciated that I showed up to the test drive early. They answered any questions I had with no delays. The test drive went smoother than expected Friberiro (employee at Showroom) helped make this a test drive to remember.


**Previous car**: 2013 BMW 328i ZF 8-speed ( I really don’t miss this car)


**Current car**: Honda Civic EX-T’16 CVT



*Note*: This is my opinion based on one test drive. If I said the wrong information for the touch screen or anything else please correct me.



*Duration of test drive*: 1:05 pm to 1:45 pm 40 minutes 



*Type of driving*: Mixed driving intercity traffic, interstate driving and the suburb's 



**Cons**



**The doors closing**- When you close them it makes a loud clank sound. The showroom Model 3 actually made a louder sound than the test car I drove. The sound makes it seem like the doors are going to break every time you close them. 



**The ride quality**- I expected the quality to be slightly better. ( it may have to do with the tester riding on 19 in chrome wheels). Did not ride over bumps as well as expected. I felt light thuds when riding over bumps or road inconsistencies sometimes.




**Neutral**



**The Higher floor**- The higher floor of the car (due to the battery being low in the car) bother me in the first minutes of the test drive but I got used to it. The higher floor will hamper back seat room, I'm 6'1 sitting in the back seat I felt I had solid knee room and 2 inches of headroom I have a 3-inch tall Mohawk (although the front seat at that current setting was somewhat of a tight squeeze). The higher floor helps with visibility.

post,bkho9j,,Tesla Model 3 AWD vs. C7 Corvette Grand Sport,"I’ve been daily driving Corvettes for the past (7) years or so. I had 5 years in an old C5 Corvette and spent the last two years in a C7 Grand Sport. While I *love* Corvettes my life has slowly become more complicated to the point where daily driving a C7 Grand Sport has been less and less of a joy.

Now don’t get me wrong, Corvettes are the most daily-able sports cars you can get. Plenty of trunk room, an honest 30mpg if you drive them calmly, the cars are reliable, and they are generally affordable to repair/maintain. For me though, I just recently got married, moved to a place that made for a commute that was a bit more tedious than it was fun, and in general was beginning to feel a bit limited/stressed out when driving my Corvette (more on that later). So I decided to trade in my C7 Grand Sport for a Tesla Model 3 non-performance AWD. Here are my thoughts!

**Buying Experience**:

Buying a Tesla is a generally seamless and enjoyable experience, but there are some points that are a bit unnerving.

Test driving a Tesla is literally as easy as walking into your nearest store and saying“Hi I want to test drive this model”, and 5 minutes later you’re behind the wheel of whatever models they have available. The sales staff is generally pretty friendly, helpful, and polite, and there is very minimal if any sales pressure.

Compared to your typical dealership experience, where you often have to deal with a salesman sizing you up, etc. This is a much better way to test-drive a vehicle. For instance if you want to drive a 100K+ Model S P100D the answer is “Absolutely, let me grab your co-pilot and do you want any water while we wait?” as opposed to “well let’s see if you can afford it first”

The actual ordering experience is a bit odd/sketchy at times. You have to order your car online and when ordering you place a $2500 deposit to reserve your chosen configuration.",35505,True,1556945601.0,2019-05-04 06:53:21,221,149,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/bkho9j/tesla_model_3_awd_vs_c7_corvette_grand_sport/,True,0.85,2019,both,search,False,False,0,

To: Everybody

As of yesterday, we had over 50,000 net new orders for this quarter. Based on current trends, we have a good chance of exceeding the record 90,700 deliveries of Q4 last year and making this the highest deliveries/sales quarter in Tesla history!

In order to achieve this, we need sustained output of 1,000 Model 3’s per day. Almost all parts of the Model 3 production system have exceeded 1000 units on multiple days (congratulations!!) and we’ve averaged about 900/day this week, so we’re only about 10% away from 7000/week.

If we rally hard, we can do it!

post,by0g2p,,Need some advice from fellow car enthusiast when it comes to deciding between your head and your heart,"This might be a longer read so I appreciate anyone who actually bothers reading this. I thank you.

For everyone else

**TL;DR**\- Discovered my love for cars. Got myself a 2018 Honda Civic Type R. Traded it in for a Lexus IS-F half a year later thinking I made an upgrade. Realized after months that I made a huge mistake. Have a Hyundai i30 Fastback N now and like the car but don't really love it. Heart still beats for that Type R that I foolishly gave up but getting one in the near future would be another irrational decision.

&#x200B;

So I used to own a Toyota Yaris Hybrid and it was a good, reliable and cost efficient car and I paid it off completely in the end. For other people that would have been the end already but of course it wasn't very exciting to drive and I discovered the car enthusiast in myself so I traded it in for a brand new 2018 Honda Civic Type R and financed the rest. I was a JDM fan since I was a kid so getting one of those shouldn't be that surprising. I don't think I have to talk to much about the car because what basically every review or person who has driven it has said is true. It's just a marvel and I never had such a good time as when I owned that car. All kinds of strangers would check out the car or would walk up to me and ask me about it and would even talk about their own cars. Fellow car enthusiasts who you wouldn't even recognize as such and would never come it contact with otherwise. Truly a great time.

&#x200B;

Then the Lexus IS-F happened. I saw one at a dealer near me for roughly the same price as I paid for the Type R. Just with the difference that the Type R was new while the IS-F was a 8 year old used one that was well taken care of though. On paper it was an upgrade in so many ways and after the test drive that I did out of curiosity I was basically intoxicated so I traded my 6 months old Type R against that car.",6314,True,1559944853.0,2019-06-08 00:00:53,5,6,the-real-Galerion,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/by0g2p/need_some_advice_from_fellow_car_enthusiast_when/,True,0.78,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,c06af6,,A year of owning a Model S and why I'm ditching it for a Model 3 now.,"Bought a 100D Model S last June after a long time waiting for a good performing electric car to come out and compete, eventually deciding that real competition was still too far away for me to wait.  I am absolutely not a member of the Cult of Elon and quite frankly think he's a little unhinged.  That said, I do like the cars and what they offer, even with their issues.  I weighed the options of getting a 100D or a long-range Model 3 at the time, but ultimately landed on the S because the wait for a 3 a year ago was still a big unknown to me, and they were still fairly new and untested, versus the ""more mature"" Model S.

I scored what seemed like a decent deal on an end of quarter inventory S at the time, so I was pretty happy to start with.  Looking back, I wish I had done a little more research and put more thought into it before going with inventory vs newly built.

Issue #1 was that instead of a 2018 model, this was a late 2017 build (November specifically).  So that probably hurt its overall value a fair amount, but the discount was deep enough I figured to make it worth it.  I was well aware of all of this.  Issue #2 that I wasn't really aware of was that this late 2017 build car meant that it was still an ""MCU1"" car, meaning it was built with the older, inferior computer driving the infotainment, nav, etc.  The autopilot hardware was current for the time though (AP 2.5).  The older MCU wasn't really a noticeable issue for the first 4 or 5 months with the car, until it got the big version 9 update that came with a reworked UI to more closely match the Model 3's UI.  After that, performance issues have been a way of life.  Stuttering music streaming (Slacker sucks, BTW), slow navigation response sometimes, voice control rarely ever works (won't even initialize and listen for a command half the time), etc.",5849,True,1560435021.0,2019-06-13 16:10:21,153,351,Algeradd,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/c06af6/a_year_of_owning_a_model_s_and_why_im_ditching_it/,True,0.78,2019,both,search,False,False,0,

I guess it's more a praise of AutoPilot rather than Tesla per se, so it's very possible other cars with advanced self-driving (either existing or in future) will have the same benefits.

-----------------

Many of us here talk about the features of our cars, the newest firmware update, the little problems (and sometimes big), and nuances of owning and driving a Tesla. But I want to shift the conversation for just a moment and speak to how owning a Tesla has impacted my life as a whole. I emphatically encourage anyone else here to share your story, good or bad, as well. So here goes...

I commute about 3 hours a day in heavy LA traffic. Next to NYC, it's probably the most grueling nightmare of lane changes, starting and stopping, praying to the Gods of Sidestreets that you can make it home with a fraction of your sanity still intact in the US. The HOV lanes are a small reprieve at times, but often just as congested as the regular ones. On any given day, most of us that live here probably in jest wish for a quick death to end it all just so we don't have to sit in another hour of traffic; yet somehow we prevail to drive another day. We drove our dumb cars, in dumb traffic, with dumb people, and even dumber gas prices. This was our plight, and yet we were resigned to it, even though with every breathe we said ""Dear Lord, why me? What did I do to deserve this?"" We returned home fatigued, haggard, with barely enough energy to cook a good meal for ourselves or our families. We fell asleep during movie night with our significant others because the road took what life we had left in us at the end of a long work day.

Then Tesla came around and offered me an alternative.

post,c2wc90,,"There aren't a lot of Model 3 reviews from ""traditional"" car enthusiasts, so I wrote my own","While I know the Model 3 has been out for 2 years now, it seems a lot of reviews are from Tesla fans and not so much “traditional” car enthusiasts, so I thought I’d write a review voicing my opinions. That, plus I want my thoughts recorded for my own posterity.

For some time now, I’ve been considering purchasing a Tesla Model 3. I’m generally a more frugal car enthusiast, and spending $39.9k on any other car would be nuts to me, but the Tesla at least on paper offers a lot to like: there’s of course the instant acceleration at any speed, but there’s also the super low CoG, lack of distractions in the cabin (so you can focus on driving!), no warm-up and cool-down procedures, OTA updates that occasionally bring performance and range increases, and no guilt associated with lots of unnecessary driving, which I personally do value. I was also very tempted by Autopilot, since there are times I just don’t care to drive and would be perfectly happy to let the car do the work.

So, to assuage my curiosity, I rented a long-range RWD model for two days from Turo. I spent a couple minutes adjusting settings, drove off, and… instantly hated it. Right off the bat:

* I could not for the life of me get the seat into a comfortable position. The seat bottom was bolstered too much and cut into my thigh, the pressure on my back was awful no matter where I put the lumbar support, and the headrest intrudes forwards and *doesn’t adjust at all* so when sitting upright, your head actually touches the seat before your shoulders do. Try to put your shoulders against the seat too, and you end up sitting like a hunchback. I absolutely *hated* this, and despite frequently adjusting the seat throughout the two days, I couldn’t make it any better.

* The driver’s mirror doesn’t adjust far enough out.

post,d48wyg,,Is Kia Telluride's driving assist system as good as Tesla's Autopilot? It's actually pretty close. Here’s an in depth review from a Tesla owner.,"DRIVING ASSIST

I recently got a chance to drive a Kia Telluride ""S"" for a day and spent a fair bit of that time testing out the driving assist system in it, which is likely to function the same in its Hyundai counterpart, the Palisade.

Coming from owning a Tesla Model S with Autopilot 2 hardware, I've been interested in the Telluride/Palisade's driving assist system since early reviews. After seeing the Straight Pipe's review of the Telluride (https://youtu.be/v8bqw7qjwus), calling it the ""best lane keep of any car they've driven this year"", I knew I had to find out if a rarely talked about feature in Kia's new flagship vehicle could really meet or beat the gold standard for driving assist; Tesla's autopilot.

The two features I'm specifically interested in are the ""Lane Following Assist (LFA)"" and the ""Smart Cruise Control w/ Stop and Go (SCC)"". The first applies to the steering by keeping you centered in the lane, the second handling the acceleration and braking. Plenty of cars I've driven have good adaptive cruise control systems, and barely noticeable lane keeping systems, but few have come close to the magic of Tesla's autopilot in keeping you a safe distance from cars and objects, and centered in the lane.

THE SYSTEM IN USE

After enabling Kia's ""Lane Following Assist"" in the driver's settings menu from the steering wheel, it will only reveal itself on the dashboard once the adaptive cruise control has been turned on and set. A little steering wheel icon will show up colored white to the right of the adaptive cruise icon in the dashboard. It seems that the ""Lane Following Assist"" will be available and activate on just about any road with good lane lines. This is one of Tesla's Autopilot's best features, as you're not limited to preordained highways like in Cadillac's Supercruise. It was available and active for me most of the time I was using the adaptive cruise control.",11328,True,1568485330.0,2019-09-14 20:22:10,70,21,humanwire,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/d48wyg/is_kia_tellurides_driving_assist_system_as_good/,True,0.83,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,d7i02d,,Anyone else excited for the Model S Plaid?,"Without starting another blatant Porsche VS. Tesla pissing contest, is anyone else excited that Tesla is attempting something like the Model S Plaid? 

I'm a current Model 3 AWD owner, and before that was a C7 Grand Sport owner. I like sporty high performance vehicles but the driving characteristics and convenience of an EV are really hard to pass up. Since getting my Model 3 AWD, I've been very happy but have also been yearning for something with a bit more performance to it. 

I was cautiously optimistic about the Taycan as it seemed to offer a more sporty alternative to Tesla's EV offerings, but the super high starting price tag, lack of self driving functionality, and comparatively limited range made it less of an option for me. Especially considering that you could get a Model 3 performance and a C8 combined for less money.

Though there's a lot of debate about how legitimate the Model S Plaid's times are, I think it's really exciting to see some straight up competition like this. Likewise, even if the Model S Plaid only matches the Taycan's performance on the track it is still going to be cheaper, have better range, have autopilot, and a more established charging infrastructure to go off of. 

What's really compelling to me is that the Model S Plaid really could be the first car that could legitimately nail great track performance with unparalleled day to day convenience, and though it will still be expensive, it will be at a more obtainable price point comparatively speaking. 

I just think the fact that we're coming out with cars that look to be so capable is something to really get excited about.",1632,False,1569107199.0,2019-09-22 01:06:39,6,25,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/d7i02d/anyone_else_excited_for_the_model_s_plaid/,True,0.54,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,das2jn,,Tesla Model 3 AWD vs C7 Grand Sport Road Trip Review,"  

I recently took a trip from Los Angeles up to San Francisco in my Tesla Model 3 AWD. It was my first time road tripping in an electric vehicle and I did a similar trip in my old C7 Corvette Grand Sport so I figured it would be worth sharing my experiences. 

**Routes:** 

My trip in the Model 3 was straight up I-5 from Los Angeles to San Francisco. 

On the C7 I took a more scenic PCH/101 route up to San Francisco and then took the I-5 home. 

Though not exactly an apples to apples comparison on the way up, I think each route played to the car’s strengths. 

The C7 route was made more for of an enjoyable/scenic driving experience, whereas the Model 3 route was made to be very safe with Tesla supercharger infrastructure in mind. 

**Driving Experience:** 

**C7:** To be honest my road trip experience in the C7 left a little to be desired. On the way up I picked a fairly enjoyable route along the California coast with enough beautiful views to make for a memorable experience, and with enough fun road for the car to stretch its legs. Here’s what I ran into. 

**-It was a little harsh.** Though my car did have magnetic ride shocks and we traveled primarily in “tour” mode the C7 did beat me up after a little while. For reference I’m a 27 year old so it’s not like this is some old guy complaining who’s expecting Cadillac ride quality in his track-focused sports car. This also isn’t to say that the car is too stiff to be enjoyable on road trips…it’s just that the sporty setup does wear on you after a few hours. 

**-The car was a little hard to enjoy in the spirited sections of the trip.** This isn’t to say that the C7 handled bad, wasn’t fast in delivering power, etc. It’s just that the C7 Grand Sports’ limits are so high that street legal and street safe speeds don’t really excite it. So driving some of the spirited sections on this trip was a bit of let down because it felt like I was only using a fraction of the car’s potential.",15390,True,1569741944.0,2019-09-29 09:25:44,31,38,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/das2jn/tesla_model_3_awd_vs_c7_grand_sport_road_trip/,True,0.69,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Serious stuff is happening in Shanghai, the site of Tesla’s second manufacturing facility, company executives said on a phone call with investors. The carmaker’s “low-cost” Model 3 vehicles are already moving through assembly lines on a trial basis, and Musk heralded the “massive” stamping machines and in-operation paint shop. He also confirmed media reports that a second building is under construction in the Shanghai complex to handle battery and module production. Tesla hopes to produce 1,000 Model 3s a week from the factory by the end of the year. It will also produce Model Ys, its affordable crossover model, at the plant.

In its earning report, Tesla said it is working to finalise its local manufacturing license and to meet “other governmental requirements” before ramping up production in Shanghai.

That’s good news for Tesla, because China is vital to the carmaker’s future. Though the country’s economy has been buffeted by a trade war with the US, it still has among the most electric-vehicle-friendly regulations on the globe.

post,dxo5ww,,Racial bias in Investing? Just look at the data.,"“But I’m not a racist” 

is a constant refrain in Silicon Valley — a place where 91% of venture capitalists are men, 98% are white or Asian, and almost 90% of their funding goes to white-male led ventures.

It seems like if you buy the pint of vanilla ice cream over the chocolate pint 98 out of 100 times you walk into the grocery store, you might have some ingrained preference for vanilla, no? Maybe you think you have open taste buds, but if vanilla is on the front of the shelf, and it’s a brand you recognize, it’s just the easiest thing to pick up and move on with your day. You’re not looking to see if something else might be available, and equally or more delicious, hiding in plain sight. You’re moving on autopilot, and thus eating a lot of vanilla, whether or not it’s good for you. And that’s what’s most tragic about the status quo – it not only hurts those who aren’t getting chosen, but also the person doing the choosing. 

Venture capitalists, and the asset owners and managers who fund them, pride themselves on being open-minded when it comes to allocating capital: “I don’t care if they are black, blue or have purple spots, as long as they are great managers who can make money.” They view themselves as fully available to new flavors, spotting trends before others do in order to capture the best returns in a competitive market. 

But they are forgetting about the notion of unconscious bias, the ingrained habits we get from society that are extra difficult to root out. Like breathing while sleeping, they happen so naturally we don’t even acknowledge their existence. We only see the outcome — that we don’t die in our sleep (if we are lucky), and we wind up with portfolios of predominantly white fund managers and entrepreneurs. 

This not only means that we as capital allocators perpetuate the vast racial and socioeconomic inequality of our society, but also that we are missing out on massive sources of innovation in a majority-minority country.",13632,True,1574006060.0,2019-11-17 16:54:20,0,9,hugebiggiant,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/dxo5ww/racial_bias_in_investing_just_look_at_the_data/,True,0.13,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,e0o0gm,,Has your view on the Telsa truck changed since the reveal?,"When I watched the Cybertruck reveal I was in shock.  I thought it was so ugly. When the ""unbreakable"" windows broke the whole event seemed like a complete disaster.  Someone made the joke of ""what if John Delorean designed the El Camino"" and I laughed my ass off thinking that was dead on.

But a day or so later, after watching several in-depth youtuber videos of the truck from the test rides, seeing the interior and how massive and spacious the whole thing is, seeing the 16 inch ground clearance (this thing is NO El Camino), looking at the specs, utility features and price I have completely done a 180.  I have decided it's going to be my next vehicle and almost can't wait to get one.  

I'm curious to see what your thoughts are.  What was your initial impression of the Telsa Cybertruck and has that changed as you've taken a closer look?

In the biggest-ever takeover in the luxury-goods industry, lvmh, a French global conglomerate, announced its acquisition of **Tiffany**, an American jeweller founded in 1837 and known for its flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York. lvmh is paying $16.9bn, more than the roughly $14.5bn that was suggested when the transaction was first mooted in late October. The deal represents a success for Bernard Arnault, lvmh’s boss and controlling shareholder, who had courted Tiffany for some time. See [article](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/11/30/lvmh-tests-the-limits-of-luxury).

## The magic trick

The flotation of **Alibaba’s** shares on the Hong Kong stockmarket raised $11.2bn, making it the most valuable share offering this year, ahead of the $8.1bn that Uber raked in at its ipo in May. The stock rose by 6.6% on the first day of trading in what is a secondary listing in Alibaba. Its shares are also listed in New York. See [article](https://www.economist.com/node/21775688).

**Uber** lost its licence to operate in London, again. The ride-hailing company has 45,000 drivers in the city, one of its biggest markets. London’s transport regulator raised more concerns about safety, including 14,000 fraudulent trips by unauthorised drivers. Uber is appealing against the decision and can continue to operate while it does so. See [article](https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/11/27/london-hits-uber-hard-and-hails-a-fleet-of-new-cheaper-apps).

The chief executive of **Westpac** resigned and the chairman said he would step down next year, as Australia’s second-largest bank faced mounting criticism about its response to a money-laundering scandal.

Veteran executives and financiers helped fuel WeWork’s spectacular rise and fall, pouring in capital while ceding control to its founder

By Maureen Farrell and Eliot Brown
Dec. 14, 2019 12:00 am ET
 
In early October, WeWork’s board of directors trickled into a brick building in lower Manhattan where the startup had an office. After they took their seats around the conference room table, Mark Schwartz started to vent.

“I’ve stayed silent too long,” the 65-year-old former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner told the six other men on the board, including WeWork’s co-founder and chairman, Adam Neumann.

Mr. Schwartz aired his frustrations about the state of the company, which was perilously low on cash after years of freewheeling spending and had become the butt of jokes on Wall Street, according to people familiar with the meeting.

No more fantasies, he said, as advisers and others looked on. Now, he said, they needed to make decisions that would save the company.

Even more remarkable than the content of Mr. Schwartz’s blistering rebuke was the fact that it came so late. The banker had stayed silent so long that the story was almost over.

We Co., as the parent company is officially known, was already a distressed asset by then, undone by conflicts and the dawning realization that it was just a hip real-estate sublessor—not a tech company. A few weeks earlier, WeWork had shelved its disastrous attempt at an initial public offering and Mr. Neumann had subsequently stepped down as chief executive.

It was a spectacular fall for the company that months before had been America’s most valuable startup.

Little of WeWork’s trajectory would have been possible were it not for the collection of veteran executives and financiers from the upper echelons of Wall Street and Silicon Valley who enabled Mr.",34647,True,1576340063.0,2019-12-14 17:14:23,47,4,TheDitkaDog,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/ealke8/wsj_weekend_the_money_men_who_enabled_adam/,True,0.89,2019,elon,search,False,False,0,

post,emyypl,,A New Year a New Car! Here's my 2020 Stinger GT Limited,"Most people get the practical car first then the weekend car, I did the opposite and after two years of no vehicle to drive during Canadian winter it was time to get another car.


My only requirements were that it have 4 doors and be more practical then the Corvette. With a budget up to 60k CAD that pretty much meant anything and everything under the sun was available. For the first few weeks I couldn't make up my mind, I considered sports sedans like the Stinger, G70 and the CTS/ATS-V. I considered things like the Civic, Golf, WRX and Focus all the up to their top performance versions. I even considered a new RAM 1500, ZR2 and a used Hellcat/392.


After many weeks I came to the conclusion I wanted something that was still fun but practical and AWD was heavily preffered. So that eliminated any ideas of driving a V8 charger, Hellcat or otherwise as well as the trucks.


I looked at the Golf R, STI, RS and Type R but I'm not a fan of hatchbacks and for the price the STI felt like a terrible deal.


This left the Stinger and the G70. God this was tough. First the value proposition of a Stinger in Canada is insanity. It costs top spec the same as a US Stinger, normally similar vehicles in Canada are around 13% more expensive in Canada vs the US. This played heavily into it, 52k for a loaded Stinger, 365hp, AWD and tech through the roof is ridiculous when you consider that the STI stickers for 49k CAD. Just no contest here.


I took a trip over to my local Kia dealer, they didn't have a GT, just the 4 cylinder so I took that for a spin and liked it a lot. The car overall should be similar to the GT so if I liked the 4 cylinder odds are I'd love the GT.


Next came the G70. Genesis does things differently in Canada. There is no dealer, they ship a car right to you. I scheduled a test drive, my ideal combo would be the top 3.3 trim with red stitching and Mallorca Blue. They didn't have it available but I got to drive the 3.3 regardless.",5337,True,1578698136.0,2020-01-11 00:15:36,124,73,The_Exia,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/emyypl/a_new_year_a_new_car_heres_my_2020_stinger_gt/,True,0.9,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,eo5ie9,,Tesla hit $500 and 90B Market cap. If it grows 10% more Elon will get hist first portion of his compensation which is 1% of Tesla's current total outstanding shares.,"**CEO Performance Award Details**

The performance award consists of a 10-year grant of stock options  that vests in 12 tranches. Each of the 12 tranches vests only if a pair  of milestones are both met.

* Market Cap Milestones: To meet the first market cap milestone, Tesla's current market cap must increase to $100 billion. For each of the remaining 11 milestones, Tesla's market cap must continue to increase in additional $50 billion increments. Thus, for Elon to fully vest in the award, Tesla's market cap must increase to $650 billion.
* Operational Milestones: To meet the operational milestones, Tesla  must meet a set of escalating Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA targets (the  only adjustment to EBITDA is for stock-based compensation). These  milestones are even more directly aligned with shareholder value  creation than those used in Elon's 2012 performance award. They are  designed to ensure that as Tesla's market cap grows, the company is also  executing well on both a top-line and bottom-line basis.

For each of the 12 tranches that is achieved, Elon will vest in  stock options that correspond to 1% of Tesla's current total outstanding  shares (1% of that amount is approximately 1.69 million shares). If  none of the 12 tranches is achieved, Elon will not receive any  compensation.

post,f2ufj4,,"Should We Buy Tesla Stock Now? Here's What Earnings, Charts Show"," Tesla stock has a history of being erratic, with its mercurial Chief  Executive Elon Musk frequently drawing attention with bold claims about  production and profitability that have been a challenge for analysts to  discern.  
 

Now, with production of the **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA))  Model 3 in full swing, including at its new China plant, and with the  company's Model Y and Cybertruck truck in development stages, Musk has  defied skeptics once again.  
  Tesla stock has surged to record highs over the past nine weeks,  reaching a market valuation above $100 billion for the first time, on  Jan. 22. Tesla is up more than 208% since Oct. 23, the day before it  jumped more than 17% on an [earnings-fueled gap up](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-earnings-jump-third-quarter-profit/). 

&#x200B;

 Among recent catalysts for Tesla stock: Billionaire investor Ron Baron said he believes the company has the potential to hit [$1 trillion in revenue in 10 years](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-continues-climb-on-positive-comments/). In addition, [Baillie Gifford & Co](https://fintel.io/soh/us/tsla/baillie-gifford-), Tesla's top shareholder outside of CEO Musk, disclosed that it's raised its stake to 7.67% from 7.46%.  
  With its market cap now close to $141 billion, Tesla overtook **Volkswagen** ([VWAGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VWAGY)) as the second most valuable auto company. But it's behind Japan's **Toyota Motor** ([TM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TM)), which has a market cap of about $198 billion. The market cap of Tesla is more than **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) and **Ford Motor** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) combined.

post,fvj7or,,Someone on Quora made a really good point on why it’s a good idea to go all-in on Tesla.,"I was 50-50 on QQQ and VTI. However after reading this post I am gonna switch to all-in on Tesla. I think they’re gonna grow as big as Ford, GM and so forth one day. Below is the full post. 

https://www.quora.com/How-does-Tesla-continue-running-and-making-cars-if-they-lose-money-every-year-From-where-do-they-get-the-money-to-continue/answer/Steve-Baker-100?ch=10&share=3dd4d100&srid=uumtx


“You are falling for a common line put up by Tesla-haters and short-sellers.

Tesla does sell cars for more than the cost of making them. Some estimates say 30% more.

For people like you and me - we’d call that a “Profit” and by the standards of the car industry, it’s a very good one…but it’s not strictly profit if you go and spend it all.

Remember: For all the noise that’s made about them, Tesla are a TINY company. Ford and GM each make between 5 and 7 million cars every year. Tesla makes about 300,000 cars per year (2019). They are a tiny fly-speck of a company compared to VW and Toyota - both of which dwarf Ford and GM.

WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE EXCESS MONEY YOU MAKE?

So what should Tesla do with that “profit”? Put it in the bank? Use it as a stock dividend to pay back their investors? Pay back their loans ahead of schedule?

NO!!!

That would be completely, INSANELY, STUPID!!

Tesla, have Model Y owners who ordered a car and will have to wait a year to get it. As of February 2020, they had 550,000 pre-orders (and climbing) for the CyberTruck and they haven’t even chosen the site for the factory they’ll have to build to make it in!!

When you have a HUGE backlog of orders, the only sane way to proceed is to grow the company - and to keep growing it until you can meet the demand for your product.

Therefore, they should take every spare penny they make and every penny they can borrow and use the money to build more factories!!

More factories means more cars can be manufactured - which means MORE money to build MORE factories.",6737,True,1586113390.0,2020-04-05 21:03:10,1,11,Okmanl,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fvj7or/someone_on_quora_made_a_really_good_point_on_why/,True,0.54,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,g0502h,,How to choose which stock you should buy first ?,"Hi guys,   


New Stock investor here, I have been thinking about going into the stock market since the big dip of feb 27, but I didn't know anything about stocks, and I am not US citizen so the process was much more complicated for me, now I am ready to go in, I have 9k USD available to invest and 4k more within 3 weeks (I will still have about 20k USD in saving don't worry).   


I know dollar cost average is the way to go and I am planning to do that anyway, but since the market already regained a lot of the loss since the big dip I feel like a lot of the stocks are now overvalued as well, so I am not sure which stock should I start to buy first and which to hold off on, the more I read the more complicated everything seems to get. 

&#x200B;

I want my portfolio to consist of blue chip stocks with a lot of room for growth or with steady and increasing dividends, I am ok with the volatility in the short term but I want big gains long term (I will continue investing after the virus is gone), here is the list of stocks that is on my watch list that I thought match my criteria (most of them increased in double digits since I added them on the list so I am no sure anymore),    


DIS (Disney) (I know that the parks are closed and their Cruz ships are not operating, but I feel like that will quickly be fixed with vaccine/cure)

MSFT (Microsoft) (Pretty safe and have been growing for the past few years)

Qcom (Qualcomm) (it has a lot of ups and downs, but will likely have great revenue from 5G and Autopilot chips). 

V (Visa) (Pretty safe and have been growing for the past few years and I think will gain more internationally when people deal more with credit card instead of dirty cash)

MA (MasterCard) (same as visa)

HD (The Home Depot) (Good dividend, increases often, stock price is usually going up, dominant in its market).  

Nvidia nvda (still not sure about it, only here because it is dominant in its market).",2725,True,1586726220.0,2020-04-12 23:17:00,5,22,Affiliatebeshoy,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g0502h/how_to_choose_which_stock_you_should_buy_first/,True,0.73,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,g33o28,,Cars all electric in 30 years? The real numbers.,"Hi, just recently I tripped over a YouTuber who claimed that in 30 years petrol cars will be past. Being an electrician, I couldn't help myself and calculate the real odds for that. I'll be 62 at that time and it seems like a good number to go with. So, let's hop in to the numbers and see what we have here. For simplicity, I'll be calculating only the U.S.A. The numbers are actually relatively easy to extract from data.

In 2019 US have used 142.23G gallons or 538.4G liters of gasoline or almost 5PW of chemical power.

1L of gasoline = (roughly) 9kWh worth of power.

Our efficiency number for gasoline car will be only 20% (in favor of EV's).

9,000\*0.2=1800 = only 1.8kWh/L of actually delivered power.

538.4GL\*1.8kW=969.12TW per year or almost 1PW/yr to run cars at 100% efficiency. That's no heaters, lights, autopilot, power steering etc.

Now, let's match it.

One NPP block = 1GWh of power, that is 24GWh/day and 8.76TWh a year.

970T/8.76T=110.73 nuclear power plant blocks needed to match.

Yes, you need to build 111 nuclear power plant blocks just to cover gasoline cars. That's some 1,000,000,000,000$ of private sector investments in nuclear power over next 30 years if not counting inflation, or 46 Elon Musks.

But, this is fun, let's go ""ecological"".

Largest windmill: 10MWh that's 87.6Gwh per year and 11,073 gigantic windmills in NON STOP WIND to meet the demand. Windmills realistically cost 1M$ per 1MW so the largest one will ring at around 10M$, not counting delivery and installation. Full rig to meet demand will then cost  110,730,000,000$ windmills only. Realistically you'll need double that and massive energy storage network to account for weather shifts.

Let's go solar: 1m2 = 300Wh. Let's be generous and give them 12H full sun a day (not even possible), that is 3.6kWh a day and 1.314MWh a year/1m2. You need 738,204,957m2 of panels or 118,112,640,000$ to meet demand. Realistically though you'll need at least double that to actually cover demand.",3843,True,1587135770.0,2020-04-17 17:02:50,0,14,Paegaskiller,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/g33o28/cars_all_electric_in_30_years_the_real_numbers/,True,0.35,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

> Elon Musk tweeted a complaint about Tesla’s share price that wiped $14bn off the company’s stock market value on Friday morning.

	Tesla did not immediately confirm whether Mr Musk’s tweet had been given legal clearance, and did not respond to a question about whether the company currently has a general counsel. Tesla lost three general counsels last year, one of them quitting after only two months.


	The Tesla boss, who has 33m followers on Twitter, issued his curt verdict on his company’s shares early in the morning in California on Friday, writing: “Tesla stock price is too high imo.”

Within moments the Tesla share price started sinking, dropping 10 per cent over the course of an hour before recovering slightly. The sharp move comes in what has been a hugely volatile period for Tesla’s shares. They slumped more than 60 per cent after coronavirus hit, but then rebounded by 120 per cent.

post,genu1a,,Decoding Elon's Success,"So, I wasn't even a huge fan of Elon before I started researching him for a brand new podcast and article series which I'm calling *Success Decoded*.

I've wanted a Tesla badly ever since I watched the Model X unveiling live in 2015, and had a lot of respect for him, but just didn't know much about him except that he was part of Paypal.

I chose Elon to profile first as he is the most interesting, accomplished and visionary person in the world. 

Now, I would *definitely* consider myself a **huge** fan.

So the podcast is completely ad-free, just wanted to focus on pure value.

It's gonna be a 3-parter:

\- Part 1 is out, and it's 30-mins on Elon's early life up to when he sells Zip2 and becomes a multimillionaire. 

\- Part 2 will be about SpaceX, Tesla, and all the industries he's disrupting. 

\- Part 3 will be the analysis of his success and what lessons we can learn.

I've tried to make it as accurate as possible, using the Vance biography plus loads of interviews with him (especially ThirdRow one which was awesome).

I've also tried to make it a relaxing listen. It's the first podcast I've ever produced so any and all feedback welcome!

post,gndux9,,"Number of unpaid credit card accounts in April increased 10,000% from a year ago. Number of unpaid auto loans up 350%.","From WSJ:

Millions of people are behind on their credit-card and auto-loan payments, the latest sign of the coronavirus pandemic’s financial devastation.

Lenders in April had nearly 15 million credit cards in “financial hardship” programs, such as deferral programs that let borrowers temporarily stop making payments, according to estimates by credit-reporting firm TransUnion. That accounts for about 3% of the credit-card accounts the company tracks, TransUnion said Wednesday.

Nearly three million auto loans were in these hardship programs, accounting for about 3.5% of those tracked.

The numbers have surged from a year ago, when 0.03% of credit cards and about 0.5% of auto loans were in financial-hardship programs.

The spike in unemployment caused by the coronavirus has strained people’s ability to make their monthly debt payments. To make matters worse, Americans were tapping credit cards and auto loans at record levels even before the pandemic to deal with rising costs and stagnant incomes.

As coronavirus cases surged in the U.S. and businesses shut down, millions of people told their lenders they wouldn’t be able to pay their bills. Some lenders have allowed borrowers to miss payments for as long as several months on credit cards, auto loans and personal loans.

post,gvcuey,,Why you should buy TSLA before its too late,"For those who think TSLA stock is over valued, its only shoot up even more. So many people are buying DGLY as a spec stock for the protest, imagine the potential for TSLA stock. Imagine the potential cyber truck have on the market after the protest. Many of the police cars have there windows broken and lit on fire, as well as many other civilian cars. It will be logical to think that after the protest is over the police will buy something that will be more protective to prevent that from happening again like the cyber truck with the strong reinforced windows. On top of that many police and civilian cars are destroyed so there will be some demand for cars.

If you watch the jay leno video of the cybertruck at 1:00, you can hear elon musk jokingly say how when the apocalypse come we should be glad that its bullet proof, we are a leader in apocalypse technology

This is just not for the police, seeing all these video on police brutality, correct me if im wrong, but from what i recall, most of the deadly encounter with police occurs when there is only a single police officer. If you own a cybertruck and get pulled over by an aggressive police, you can always say im staying here until your supervisor comes to de-esclate the situation. What is the police going to do?  smash the window? that's not happening. On top of that, many of these incidents are gone unrecorded and require police complaince of turning on there body camera, there are also instances where it is not  on. Owning a Tesla, you have sentry mode to protect yourself.

In california, Model 3 not only outsell cars from its own segment, BMW 3 series, but they also outsold honda civic and toyota corolla.

post,h7ojke,,Intelligent drive systems,"I went from a 2016 SQ5 which had no 'intelligent drive' features apart from blind spot monitoring and parking sensors/rear cam to a 2020 C43. 

I have a lot of highway driving for my commute about 50 kilometres each way, and my work schedule requires me to often drive home late at night when I'm tired. 

I was very interested in getting a Tesla and the model 3 when was first being announced due to their autonomous driving features, but the look was not to my taste.

I put down a deposit on the Polestar 2 because they also will have ""autopilot"" and I like how it looks but their delivery estimate was Q3 of this year and I needed a car sooner. So I had to cancel it. That sucked as I was really looking forward to it.

In the end because I could not get an electric car that I wanted and I didn't want a big car but I wanted  awd I ended up on the C43.

I checked off the intelligent Drive option without really looking into it, I thought it would be the usual lane departure warning, adaptive cruise, 360 camera.

What I found over the past few months of driving it approx 6000 km,  is that I can't imagine how good the Tesla system must be if this is what Mercedes has in their 2020 model. 

My car on the highway basically driving itself, speeds up/ slows down, comes to a complete stop and starts up again, follows curvy roads, recognize the speed limit changes and then slows down to match the speed limit or speeds up. It even changes lanes!

I feel so much more comfortable driving home at night. It even has an attention assist.

I know autonomous driving is still quite far off but I I'm so excited to see in the next couple years when I have to send this car back what my options are going to be. 

Anyone else have experience with their 'intelligent drive' system from different manufacturers ?",1810,False,1591981126.0,2020-06-12 18:58:46,10,8,fardok,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/h7ojke/intelligent_drive_systems/,True,0.73,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

2/ New EVs don’t compete with other EVs. New EVs replace ICE.
3/ TSLA’s edge: integrated software and battery tech

5/ TSLA brand synonymous w/EV
6/ Huge runway: EV 3% share, 25%  by 2025, 100% by 2030
7/ Biz model: word-of-mouth, social media, customers as advocates
8/Growth driven by TAM expansion, leverage brand to new segments
9/ Competitive disarray: ICE brand taint, software deficient

Case for 2030 TSLA $8,000 PT:
1/ TSLA currently has 17% share of the global EV market, and EVs hold just 2.7% of the global auto market, so TSLA has just 0.5% share of the overall market of 80M veh/yr. By 2030, EVs likely to hold 100% of the market (remember stick shifts?)..

2/ If in 2030 TSLA still holds 17% SOM of EVs, TSLA will sell 80M x 17% = 13.6M cars. At $10K GP/car, less $10B of R&D & SGA/yr and 20% TaxRt, TSLA 2030 NI = $100B [(13.6M x $10K-$10B) x (1-20%)].  In 2019, AAPL had $55B NI and $1.6T MC.  For TSLA $1.6T market cap =$8,000 2030 PT

People are comparing them to pets.com, but I don’t think even that company was this blatant at ripping investors off. Their “quarterly report” might as well have been a fat middle finger to both their investors and the SEC.

Oh btw the company is worth around $15B... and some analysts are saying it’s a “buying opportunity” given today’s dip.

**Edit**: for more context on the Pets.com comparison:

Pets.com had annual revenue of $619k for first year, and reached a market cap of $400M at its highest. Crazy bubble right?

Well Nikola has annual revenue of less than $100k (maybe a bit more depends on how many more solar panels the CEO is gonna order for his houses lmao), but reached market cap of $30B at its highest.

It’s literally 500 times more overvalued than the most infamous bubble stock during the dotcom crisis.

**Edit 2**: For the people who argue how revenue doesn't matter because they are the next Tesla.

For comparison. Tesla was founded in 2003 and 5 years later the original Tesla Roadster was on sale. They didn't go IPO until 2 years after that. Elon Musk also had a decent track record, being a co-founder and CEO of this small startup called PayPal.

Meanwhile Nikola Motors was founded in 2004, by a businessman with no real education whose resume is ""fluffy"" at best, and their six years of ""industry leading product development"" has yielded some fantastic CG renderings. 

Can Nikola be the next Tesla? Never say never, especially in the year 2020. But my bet is that Trevor Milton is closer to Elizabeth Holmes than Elon Musk.

**Edit 3** Ahahahaha apparently Trevor gave out more update of their factory construction (remember production is supposed to start in 2021) at yesterday's quarterly call...and drum roll......

post,ii4j0z,,‘It’s been priced in’ not so sure..,"I see this comment a lot when people are talking about buying a stock because of a future event. 

Gonna use Tesla as an example.

I’m long on Tesla and will be for a while, and I think this run up is partly to do with the split but also people realising they could literally be the biggest company in the world by the end of the decade. 

But I don’t really get the idea of the whole ‘priced in’ analogy.

The stock is at where it is now, and who knows, it might be there because people are excited on what’s to come. Let’s pretend it’s at 2200 because of all their future innovations. But what happens when Elon releases FSD, unleashes the robotaxi network, confirms first solid deliveries of the cybertruck and announces the new Roadster, the stock is just going to go up isn’t it..?

Regardless of what event is ‘priced in’, when that big event happens like any of the above, the news will still drive the stock price up, so no, it wasn’t really priced in. I think there’s a distinction between the excitement of something happening (driving price up), and the actually event happening, which will just put it up more.

Nikola ([NKLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NKLA?p=NKLA&.tsrc=fin-srch)📷) and GM ([GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM)📷) are teaming up to take on Tesla’s cybertruck.

The electric truck startup announced Tuesday it has selected GM to be its manufacturing parter for its electric pickup truck dubbed the Badger. The Badger will use GM’s widely acclaimed Ultium battery technology. Additionally, Nikola will hand over $2 billion in stock to GM — giving the automaker an 11% stake in the company.

“Nikola is one of the most innovative companies in the world. General Motors is one of the top engineering and manufacturing companies in the world. You couldn’t dream of a better partnership than this,” said Nikola founder and executive chairman Trevor Milton in a statement. “By joining together, we get access to their validated parts for all of our programs, General Motors’ Ultium battery technology and a multi-billion dollar fuel cell program ready for production. Nikola immediately gets decades of supplier and manufacturing knowledge, validated and tested production-ready EV propulsion, world-class engineering and investor confidence. Most importantly, General Motors has a vested interest to see Nikola succeed. We made three promises to our stakeholders and have now fulfilled two out of three promises ahead of schedule. What an exciting announcement.” 

Added GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra, “This strategic partnership with Nikola, an industry leading disrupter, continues the broader deployment of General Motors’ all-new Ultium battery and Hydrotec fuel cell systems. “We are growing our presence in multiple high-volume EV segments while building scale to lower battery and fuel cell costs and increase profitability. In addition, applying General Motors’ electrified technology solutions to the heavy-duty class of commercial vehicles is another important step in fulfilling our vision of a zero-emissions future.",2498,True,1599566389.0,2020-09-08 13:59:49,1020,438,addictedtostuckporn,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ios954/nikola_and_gm_team_up_to_make_900horsepower_super/,True,0.94,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,ipp3e9,,Don't be fooled. This IS The Market Crash: My DD.,"I've been researching this a LOT lately because I didn't want to get caught in it. Looking at trends and past data. I believe, strongly, that we're in the middle of the market crash. I used my knowledge and was able to fully exit my entire $500k portfolio on Tuesday, maintaining all my gains. I've even taken a sizeable position in SPY puts ($50k worth of Dec $260). I got my close friends out (well the ones who listened) on Friday at the first sign of positive movement.

First of all, a little history lesson on the [Minksy Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsky_moment#/media/File:Stylized_Minsky_Cycle.PNG). It's basically a theory for how market bubbles happen. It occurs in 5 steps. I will outline what they are in basic and how the current market looks in relation.

1. **Displacement**: This is the beginning of a new paradigm where the market changes in a big way. For this, that was the Coronavirus. This took place between February to April.
2. **Boom**: Increase in spending begins and major gains start to be made. Media attention and market involvement begin to increase. Currently, we've seen a HUGE increase in retail traders (who are extremely volatile) and massive media attention toward the stock market as it relates to corona news as well as stimulus and recovery speed gains. This took place between April and July.
3. **Euphoria**: People stop caring about any sort of reasonable investment strategy and just start throwing money at stuff. Tesla is a fantastic example of this, but many other stocks in the tech sector are guilty of this. July was the beginning of this phase as Tesla saw insane growth within a few week period and other companies followed suit very quickly. This continued into late August with Apple and Tesla going to stupid prices after their splits, and all the other big tech names reaching wild valuations.
4. **Profit Taking**: Smart money starts withdrawing funds from the market as they prepare for the crash.",13162,True,1599685339.0,2020-09-09 23:02:19,7741,1650,[deleted],stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ipp3e9/dont_be_fooled_this_is_the_market_crash_my_dd/,True,0.88,2020,tesla,top,False,False,0,

post,ixyrff,,"Elon Musk says Tesla deliveries will rise 30% to 40% in 2020, touts new battery tech","Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday he expects vehicle deliveries to increase by 30 to 40 percent over last year, when the company reported deliveries of 367,500 vehicles. The new guidance from Musk implies deliveries of between 477,750 and 514,500 cars, a range that encompasses the company’s previously stated goal to deliver half a million cars in 2020.

Musk offered the updated numbers during the company’s 2020 shareholder’s meeting on Tuesday afternoon, which was accompanied by a presentation about Tesla’s battery advances. After thanking Tesla owners for their word-of-mouth marketing, he noted: 


“In 2019, we had 50% growth. And I think we’ll do really pretty well in 2020, probably somewhere between 30 to 40 percent growth, despite a lot of very difficult circumstances.”

The company’s shares dropped more than 6% during the presentation, which took place after normal trading hours.

During the “battery day” portion of the presentation, Tesla confirmed that it is making its own battery cells at a facility in Fremont.

Joining Musk on stage, Tesla’s senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, Drew Baglino, described the new cells as a “large tabless cell,” with a “shingled spiral” design. The cells are larger than the ones Tesla purchases from Panasonic and other suppliers, and offer “thermal benefits” which make them appropriate for use in electric vehicles. 

Baglino said battery, manufacturing and design changes underway at Tesla would eventually “unlock” a 54% improvement in the range of the company’s vehicles.

Musk, who is famous for being overly optimistic on such matters, said with all the battery and manufacturing advances Tesla is working on: “About 3 years from now, we’re confident we can make a very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that’s also fully autonomous.”

post,j1z2f8,,"To what extent is Tesla really ""overvalued""?","### Disclaimer

I do not have a financial position in any of the companies mentioned here, and have no intention to initiate one within the next 72 hours.

&#x200B;

# Introduction

A common belief is that Tesla is grossly comically overvalued. Most people who express that belief point to Tesla's insanely high price to earnings ratio (P/E) to make the argument.

Tesla's current P/E is (1038). A P/E of 1000+ is patently absurd. To compare with high growth technology companies (FAANG):

* Facebook: 32.31
* Apple: 36.42
* Amazon: 131.34
* Netflix: 122.87
* Google: 27.75
* Average: 70.138

[Source (Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/)

Despite not enjoying the massive margins of the tech companies, Tesla has a P/E ratio 14.7 times greater than their average. This is simply ludicrous.

&#x200B;

# Caveats

While Tesla's P/E ratio is Prima Facie outrageous, I am of the opinion that it doesn't paint the full picture:

* Tesla's margins per car are around 20%.
* Tesla's profit margins were 1 - 2%.
   * This is a very low profit margin that leads to a relatively tiny denominator. Tesla has only just begun to turn a profit, and the margin is expected to grow significantly in future.
* Tesla's revenue growth over the last 5 years is > 50%.
   * Tesla's growth is one of the causes of their low profit margins as they're investing a lot in new factories.

&#x200B;

The below excerpt sums up my take pretty well:

>Alphabet in 2007 was clearly cheaper than Tesla is today. Alphabet’s price/sales ratio was only moderately below Tesla’s level, but its price/book ratio was much lower. In addition, Alphabet had meaningful profits, which traded at a relatively modest P/E ratio of 50 – a steep multiple for most companies but not for one growing as rapidly as Alphabet.

post,j28ihg,,Walmart Triples Tesla Semi Order In Canada,"Walmart Canada has more than tripled its order for Tesla Semi trucks in a show of confidence for the all-electric heavy-duty vehicles and the ability of its maker to deliver them.   

The Canadian division of retailer **Walmart, Inc.** [WMT 0.08%](https://benzinga.com/stock/wmt#NYSE) said Tuesday it reserved 130 of the trucks. Once in service, Walmart will have one of the biggest electric truck fleets in Canada as part of a companywide goal to [achieve zero emissions by 2040](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/walmarts-goal-for-its-trucks-no-more-diesel-by-2040). 

""I'm excited to have my drivers drive this truck,"" Francis Lalonde, Walmart Canada's vice president for transportation, told FreightWaves.

Walmart Canada expects to get its Teslas in 2021. Lalonde wouldn't detail the delivery schedule, but said the company has full confidence in **Tesla Inc.** [TSLA 0.51%](https://benzinga.com/stock/tsla#NASDAQ) ability to deliver them.

""We trust our partner,"" he said.  

The Teslas will operate within Canada as part of Walmart's private fleet of around 300 trucks with about 500 drivers. Their 500-mile range provides a good fit for Canadian fleet operations, which have drivers return to their distribution centers each day.

Walmart Canada has looked at other zero-emissions vehicles, but the Tesla Semi has so far proven the best one for its fleet, Lalonde said. Beyond the range and ability to haul 80,000-pound loads, the Tesla safety features — including its collision-avoiding autopilot — were an important selling point. 

""I firmly believe these are the safest trucks out there,"" Lalonde said. 

## ‘We've done our homework' on Tesla, Walmart executive says

Walmart Canada plans to have 20% of its fleet converted to electric power by the end of 2022. It hopes to have the entire fleet running on an alternative power source by 2028.

It also has no qualms about being an early adopter of the Tesla Semi.",2753,True,1601414498.0,2020-09-29 23:21:38,67,12,Brothanogood,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j28ihg/walmart_triples_tesla_semi_order_in_canada/,True,0.9,2020,both,search,False,False,0,
post,j59ovh,,So Tesla's quality control is embarrassingly bad. Our brand new model Y's roof just fell off,"My dad bought a brand new model Y today, and he brought me along to pick it up just in case he needed help with any tech problems. Everything was going fine and we were driving back home when we started to hear a ton of wind. I thought maybe a window was open but a minute later the entire glass roof just blew off. After a brief panic we turned around and drove the new Tesla convertible back to the dealership.

When we got back we called highway patrol to tell them that there was a car roof somewhere on the 580, but somebody might have gotten into an accident, I’m not sure. The manager at the dealership said that either the seal for the roof was faulty, or the factory just ... forgot to seal the roof on? I can’t imagine how something as big as the roof not being attached could make it past quality control. If this is a recurring problem a lot of people could get hurt. Has this ever happened before?

&#x200B;

Edit: The manager offered to get the car serviced for free, but we declined and are probably going to get an entirely new car. Whether we're still getting a Tesla is up to my dad but probably not.

But something caught my attention the other day that ended in a massive AH HAH moment that I think is a hidden preview of what to come. We all know Elon loves to surprise people - and this is probably on the future docket.

UPDATE: TL/DR: looks like they just filed with SEC for Starlink in moving vehicles. BOOM CALLED IT. 

https://www.teslarati.com/starlink-moving-vehicles-tesla-fcc-application/

I drive a 2020 Model X. I was on the freeway in autopilot just looking at my Robinhood app (safely of course...) and I was waiting for it to load. waiting... and waiting... We all know the internet on a Tesla isn't exactly the best. It's pretty dull to be honest. And then it got me thinking... Why? Why is the internet so bad on a Tesla. Surely Elon has a reason to overlook such a fundamental detail of an otherwise very futuristic car. And then I started down the rabbit hole....

I remembered a series called ""Future Car"" with Neil Degrassi Tyson a few years back and there was this quote that he said that always stuck with me (i'm paraphrasing as best I can here..)...

""In the future - cars will be able to travel within 2 inches of each other at 200 mph... because cars will talk to each other. One car will be able to hit a pot hole in the middle of a lane, and then communicate to a network to the rest of the fleet that a pot hole exists there, and to avoid it. The rest of the fleet can then maneuver safely around it.""

It was at this point then that I looked over at my dashboard and admired the new Tesla update - the fancy schmancy new Suspension update that shows the real time bounce and shock rate of each strut. Man that's a lot of data....

As I looked back at my Robinhood app I remembered for a moment that Elon had recently launched a new round of global satellites for his new company that he is going to be going public with - Starlink.

post,jjuf16,,Consumer Reports: Tesla Autopilot 'a distant second' to GM's Super Cruise in hands-free test,"Tesla Autopilot 'a distant second' to GM's Super Cruise in hands-free test: Consumer Reports

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co's (GM.N) Super Cruise once again edged Tesla's (TSLA.O) Autopilot in an evaluation of 17 vehicles equipped with active driving assistance systems (ADAS) by Consumer Reports, the testing organization said on Wednesday.

A Tesla Model Y fitted with Autopilot finished ""a distant second,"" the group said, to a Cadillac CT6 equipped with Super Cruise, which GM is rolling out to more than 20 vehicles - including its new Hummer electric pickup truck - over the next three years.

Safety and insurance researchers have frequently warned of the risks of consumers overestimating ADAS systems' abilities, a misconception increased by some automakers calling their products Autopilot, ProPilot or Co-Pilot.

In 2018, the Cadillac CT6 with Super Cruise scored higher than a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot, in a Consumer Reports test of just four vehicles equipped with ADAS.

In the latest test, conducted this summer on a track and on public roads, the Cadillac scored 69 points out of a possible 100, while the Tesla scored 57. A Lincoln Corsair equipped with Ford Motor Co's (F.N) Co-Pilot 360 system, finished third with 52.

The critical difference in the Super Cruise system is a driver-facing infrared camera to make sure he or she is paying attention to the road and is ready to take over manual control when necessary, said Kelly Funkhouser, head of connected and automated vehicle testing at Consumer Reports.

The group noted that Autopilot can shut off abruptly in some situations, while Super Cruise did a better job of notifying the driver when the system is disengaging.

In recent European safety testing, a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot placed sixth out of 10 systems, getting high marks for performance and ability to respond to emergencies, but falling short on its ability to maintain a driver’s focus on the road.

Stocks opened today’s session higher before paring some gains ahead of an extremely busy week, with market participants closely monitoring the results of the US presidential election, a meeting of the Federal Reserve, and the October jobs report, and rising coronavirus numbers in the US and Europe.

After an extremely choppy day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.22% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 1.11% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing 1.56% up.

On Tuesday is the US presidential election between incumbent Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result,  it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016. If this pace picks up, this election could have the highest voter participation rate in over 100 years.

Regardless of the outcome, the election will have a number of consequences for Corporate America.",8096,True,1604351118.0,2020-11-02 22:05:18,109,22,psychotrader00,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jmw6mo/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_monday_november/,True,0.96,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

post,jxt5tz,,3 Years with a Chevy Bolt,"I'm getting ready to turn in my Chevy Bolt after a 3 year lease, so I thought I'd share my thoughts on the ownership experience after 38,000 miles...

**Typical Commute:** 70 mile roundtrip in heavy traffic (suburban, stop-and-go highway, and urban), around 3 hours a day

**Environment:** Garage with 220V Level 2 charger, outdoor temps ranging between -20F and 100F

**Pros!**  EV powah, range, heated steering wheel, ride, steering, visibility, interior space, Apple CarPlay, low maintenance needs, relatively quiet

**Cons!**  Front wheel traction, the seats, HVAC, stupid GM things, weak switchgear, dopey styling

&#x200B;

I rage quit a BMW i3 after waking up to a fully-charged car with only 50 total miles on a 10F day.  Having to stop at a Level 3 DC charger every day for 20 minutes was getting old real fast when my commute home was already over an hour every day, so I test drove a Chevy Bolt and liked it enough to lease one for 3 years/15,000 miles a year.  I was planning to go over my mileage on the lease and backfill the difference with my Boxster, but my job ended up being converted to a WFH position last year.

Overall it's been a good experience.  I can't say I've had any moments where I looked forward to driving it, but I do catch myself from time to time thinking about how nice it is to drive.  The heated steering wheel is so, so nice on cold days and Apple CarPlay works flawlessly after a couple of iOS updates.  The maintenance schedule for the car has 3 total items: tire rotation, cabin air filter, and battery coolant flush at 150k miles.  I've done all of the tire rotations in my own garage and had the cabin air filter replaced at its only dealer visit for a software recall.

Electric range has been a non-issue with this car, the first time this has happened with any of my previous EVs.  I can count on one hand the number of times I've stopped at a public charger.

I have no financial position in Tesla at this point in time and no interest in initiating one within the next month.

&#x200B;

# Introduction

There seems to be a strong sentiment among some that Tesla is vastly overvalued, and that the current stock price is completely unrooted in reality. I understand the viewpoint, but don't really share the belief. That's not particularly surprising as I consider myself a Tesla optimist. I decided to present in brief the case for Tesla's valuation as I understand it.

&#x200B;

# Overvalued?

Tesla's current market capitalisation appears to be grossly overvalued, especially when compared to their peers in the automotive sector as [these charts so clearly illustrate](https://preview.redd.it/gdvz8sgmpz061.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=45524ed08b3899febc3fa9b67329569e25a906b9).

In fact, the charts actually understate things as Tesla's market cap currently seats at around $464 billion. You could add another Daimler to the US and EU listed companies and they would still have a lower market capitalisation than Tesla.

This really is the case for Tesla being overvalued: it's automotive revenues is many times it's current market capitalisation. [Per MarketWatch, Tesla's trailing PE is 978.44](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla/company-profile?mod=mw_quote_tab), so it's not as if Tesla is especially profitable either.

On a fundamentals basis, Tesla appears to be grossly overvalued.

&#x200B;

# Growth

The above chart doesn't necessarily indicate that Tesla's current market capitalisation is an extremely speculative bubble that could burst soon, but more that Tesla is not valued based on its current financial situation. Tesla is valued as an extreme growth company, and it's growth over the past five years bears this out.

post,kkz8n9,,There is nothing wrong with preferring automatic gearboxes to a manual (and similar gripes),"I have seen this said a few times on reddit / as well as an equal amount of *""to hell with the slushboxes""* posts and comments making enthusiasts feel less included because of their preference of gearbox technology.

 I think it needs to be said outright that if you do not like manuals / prefer and automatic - you are no less of an enthusiast as the guy with save the manuals stickers and a slightly larger left leg.

Now I drive a manual. A 5 speed e46. With it's quirks it is a great gearbox and incredibly fun to drive. Driving through the twisties in the mountains racking through the gears and revmatching before coming around a bend is very rewarding. If I were to purchase a true sports car - such as a miata, elise, or brz / similar. A manual would be required, but..

Every time I drive a car with an auto I think *""Hmm. This is nice.""* and that is in a minivan with a gearbox that takes 3 seconds to step down.

Comparatively auto gearbox technology has gotten incredible. 10 speed boxes that seamlessly switch gears and step down immediately are becoming a norm in sporty oriented cars. For a practical and fun car a gearbox like this can be much more livable than a manual for many people.

Now dual clutch technology - that is quite incredible. Instantaneous seamless shifts that are controlled by the operator but can also be controlled automatically through driver modes. A direct connection to the drivetrain rather than through a torque converter. In any car short of a automobiles that are purposefully engineered to provide a classic sports coupe / roadster experience - this is my ideal gearbox.

post,knz82h,,Why the $TSLA bubble will not burst?,"A correction (\~-20%) can happen, but the bubble will not burst (where $TSLA loses more than 50%-90% of its value). Here's why:  

So a lot of people often use the dotcom bubble as a parallel to speculate the pop of the Tesla bubble. The most immediate comparisons come from names such as Amazon, which lost nearly 90% of its value from the peak of the bubble but was eventually able to gain back most of its shares. Other comparisons also include stocks such as Yahoo, which was actually added to the S&P 500 in 1999, right before the bubble burst, or even Qualcomm/Cisco. 

These speculations and comparisons are always interesting to think about. They come from deductions, aka where you extrapolate data points from the past in order to predict what is going to happen in the future. However, a deduction is often not the most useful mental model, especially when circumstances are different in the future. And this is one of those cases where the circumstances are actually very different. 

Now the basic argument of ""Tesla is not a car company"" is often overused. Yes, Tesla creates batteries, they are going into the autonomous market soon, their AutoPilot is one of the best AI that the world has today (stronger than NVIDIA's GPUs), they are going to get into the insurance game, they are going to get into the financing industry, some people might even say they are going to collaborate with Space X to create flying cars in 2050. That's all great. However, I'm actually going to argue that despite all of these things, Tesla's current price is overvalued but yet, the stock will not burst. And this has in large part to do with how the markets and trader psychology works today, and how different it is from 1999/2000:

We are currently having a record level of downloads for the Signal app around the world. Between WhatsApp announcing they would be sharing everything with the Facebook mothership and the Apple privacy labels that allowed people to compare us to other popular messengers, it seems like many people are interested in private communication. 

Some quick facts about us: we are an open-sourced nonprofit organization whose mission is to bring private and secure communication to anyone and everyone. One of the reasons we opted for organizing as a nonprofit is that it aligned with our want to create a business model for a technology that wasn’t predicated on the need for personal data in any way. 

As an organization we work very hard to not know anything about you all. There aren’t analytics in the app, we use end to end encryption for everything from your messages and calls/video as well as all your metadata so we have no idea who you talk to or what you talk about.

We are very excited for all the interest and support, but are even more excited to hear from you all. 

We are online now and answering questions for at least the next 3 hours (in between a whole bunch of work stuff). If you are coming to this outside of the time-window don't worry please still leave a question, we will come back on Monday to answer more.

post,l3z5jq,,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

post,l4exak,,Waymo CEO dismisses Tesla self-driving plan,"I know a lot of people here are betting big on TSLA winning the race to FSD. I was aware that TSLA's competition disagreed with their approach, but this is still surprisingly dismissive.

Source: https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/01/waymo-ceo-tesla-is-not-a-competitor-at-all/

> Many Tesla fans view the electric carmaker as a world leader in self-driving technology. CEO Elon Musk himself has repeatedly claimed that the company is less than two years away from perfecting fully self-driving technology.

> But in an interview with Germany's Manager magazine, Waymo CEO John Krafcik dismissed Tesla as a Waymo competitor and argued that Tesla's current strategy was unlikely to ever produce a fully self-driving system.

> ""For us, Tesla is not a competitor at all,"" Krafcik said. ""We manufacture a completely autonomous driving system. Tesla is an automaker that is developing a really good driver assistance system.""

> For Musk, these two technologies exist along a continuum. His plan is to gradually make Tesla's Autopilot software better until it's good enough to work with no human supervision. But Krafcik argues that's not realistic.

> ""It is a misconception that you can just keep developing a driver assistance system until one day you can magically leap to a fully autonomous driving system,"" Krafcik said. ""In terms of robustness and accuracy, for example, our sensors are orders of magnitude better than what we see on the road from other manufacturers.""

> This isn't a new argument.

> **Tesla keeps missing Musk's predictions**

> Tesla has a lot riding on its efforts to develop fully self-driving technology. Since 2016, Tesla has been selling cars with a suite of cameras, radar, and other hardware that it has touted as ready for full self-driving with a future software update.

post,l5jq8t,,Don't sleep on Lordstown Motors - $RIDE,"Its CEO is Steve Burns, founder of and has a close relationship with fellow American EV company, Workhorse $WKHS. Is an EV company in the United States. Has the ex-director of Tesla. Has the third largest gigafactory in the United States, having taken the reigns of the abandoned Lordstown, Ohio plant GM left to rot just a few years ago. Their main slice of pie is the Lordstown Endurance, an EV pickup truck that already has working prototypes. Press has included having the Endurance parked at the White House and the Endurance being driven by a guy from CNBC. They plan to bring the Endurance to market by end of year/early next year.


The Endurance as of this post has no direct competitor. Its an EV pickup truck marketed to the working class man. Its priced at $52,500 offering 250 mile gas range, tow capability of 6,000lbs. Pre-orders booked at 100,000 as of January 12.

The factory is in full working shape. The company isn't fucking around and fluffing investors. They stated their mission, showed a proof of concept and got to work.

This also brings a story to sell the news on of a destitute American town that GM abandoned and time forgot, being saved by new hard working jobs, crafting top of the line American-made pickup trucks.


This last point gets more bullish with Biden's recent executive order and how much he's proven to be invested in the future of EV. Upon taking a look at the government fleet of vehicles he intends on replacing with EV's, a sizeable portion are pickup trucks. Even disregarding this, the mission is clear to have an EV manufacturer for the USPS. And I'll say this one more time - THERE IS NO DIRECT COMPETITOR TO THE ENDURANCE.

Say what you will about the Cybertruck but its just not a proper candidate for the Endurance's demographic. The Hummer EV is priced at $90k. Ford's at least another year away from the F150 EV.

post,lcftzc,,10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.

post,llg0ke,,17 Investment Principles from Warren Buffett and the late Benjamin Graham,"While many may argue that value investing doesn't make sense anymore, a lot of the rules and investment principles from Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham stand the test of time, especially when you apply current nuance to their original investment rules (which are now close to a century-old)...

**Disclaimer:** The views below represent the opinions of the OP and are supported by research from Benjamin Graham's Security Analysis from 1934 and The Intelligent Investor from 1949, along with Google and Yahoo Finance and public statements from Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham. These investment principles do not constitute investment advice, but rather are general principles one might employ in reaching his or her overall financial goals. *All* investing bears risk, including possible loss of capital.

**#1 Create a healthy balance in your portfolio between risky and less risky investments**

*“Furthermore, a truly conservative investor will be satisfied with the gains shown on half his portfolio in a rising market, while in a severe decline he may derive much solace from reflecting how much better off he is than many of his more venturesome friends.” – quote from Benjamin Graham*

A conservative investor may have 50% of his or her portfolio in risky assets like stocks and real estate and 50% in less risky investments like US treasury bonds (which you can buy either directly from the US Treasury or through ETFs like Charles Schwab Short Term Treasuries ETF (Ticker: SCHO) as well as through investments in gold (SPDR Gold Trust (Ticker: GLD)) which tends to be a good portfolio hedge against volatile markets and inflation (at least historically).

Benjamin Graham’s formula for calculating the percentage of assets that should be in risky vs. less-risky investments is to subtract your age from 100 and invest that percentage of your assets in risky investments (like stocks), with the rest in relatively safer assets like cash and gold.",34921,True,1613516365.0,2021-02-16 23:59:25,1810,169,henry_gindt,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/llg0ke/17_investment_principles_from_warren_buffett_and/,True,0.98,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

What is important to note is that they one of the largest funds in all of Europe with $35 billion under management. And furthermore their flagship fund the Carmignac Patrimoine was one of the few funds during the volatility of 2008-2011 that outperformed their peers. I would imagine being one of the premier benchmarked asset management firms in Europe that their DD would have been successfully completed.

I had been one of those sceptics who thought Tesla was in a bubble and would eventually return to around $500-600. However I must admit after lots of research Tesla does seem to be 5 years ahead of other EV makers and i’ve been waiting ever since to see a price drop.

post,lqfhuz,,Technology stocks are crashing – what now,"A friend just messaged me saying that his portfolio lost 10% of its value recently and that this was complete doomsday. Judging by the futures, the NQ is down 6.8% from its highs (a 1.8% gap down this morning alone). I get that, it's frustrating.

It is also noteworthy that the sell-off hurts technology stocks in particular. But mind that they were also the largest beneficiary in recent months:

* Nasdaq 100 is 53% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* S&P 500 is 31% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* DJIA is 19% above its weekly 200 EMA.

Which one is going to be hurt first and foremost once a correction is underway? Of course it's going to be the most stretched industry sector. Information technology is 28% of the S&P 500, and 20% of the DJIA.

If you buy stocks, you've got to have conviction in them. You've got to know what you are buying. Am I going to dump all my holdings just because they're ""overvalued"". Of course not. I'm going to hang in there with stocks going down 30% and then come back up 80%. Even if that takes another 3 years. It's the nature of the market and it is great at weeding out the less convinced.

Volatility is the price you pay for your returns.

If you held Apple all these years, you are sitting on a fortune now. Same goes for Amazon and many other megabrands of today. Amazon went top to bottom 60% several times in its history. You've got to have conviction in what you're buying to hold onto such kind of volatility. I also go to the grocery store to pick my favorite marmalade brand. If there's a 30% discount I'll pile up. But you cannot ever pile up if you don't have conviction in your holdings in the first place.

So here's what I would do. Go through your portfolio name by name. Ask yourself why it's there in the first place. Start with ""I own XYZ because..."". Warren Buffett had also advised it in one of his interviews. If you can't tell that story, sell it off.

“Noront holds eight mineral deposits of chromite, nickel, copper, zinc, platinum, palladium, along with 100 documented mineral occurrences with showings of gold, titanium, vanadium, diamonds and cobalt.” I bought a little bit of NOT in 2014 at 62 cents after news broke out that Cliffs Natural Resources announced they would abandon its $550-million investment in the Ring of Fire and sell it to Noront Resources at an eventual 95% discount.  Noront had a 90% claim to the Ring of Fire with a “plan to mine just under one million tonnes of chromite annually, producing enough semi-finished ferrochrome to supply half of the U.S. stainless steel industry.”  At the time of my investment it seemed like relationships with First Nation people was hindering any progress of the mine. “The reason nothing was happening in the Ring of Fire has nothing to do with the value of the deposits. It is entirely due to the inability of governments on all levels, including First Nations, provincial, and federal, to reach consensus on land tenure and development plans.”  Fast forward to 2021 and I’ve lost over half of my money as Noront is now trading at 30 cents.  

Since I bought NOT, the Canadian government has promised to fund the roads needed to start the project.  “The planning and construction is being overseen by a combination of Martin Falls and Webequie First Nations and the Ontario government.  Progress on getting the roads built has been slower than Noront would like, but the company anticipates all the environmental assessments wrapping up by 2023, followed by permitting and two years of road construction leading toward a 2025 completion.",7806,True,1614338914.0,2021-02-26 12:28:34,8,13,Mikeylikesit_2020,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lsvtm5/i_believe_kwg_resources_inc_cnsxkwg_and_noront/,True,0.64,2021,both,search,False,False,0,
post,lt7oop,,JPMorgan advises clients to expose 1% of their portfolio to Bitcoin,"In a recent note to clients, strategists from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) suggested a one percent portfolio allocation to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

As reported by Bloomberg, JPM strategists Joyce Chang and Amy Ho opined that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against fluctuations from traditional assets like bonds, stocks, and commodities. However, they advised clients to allocate a small percentage due to the risk of major downturns in Bitcoin’s value.

After setting a new all-time high above $58,000, the value of the digital asset slumped to less than $45,000 and has been struggling to recover ever since.

Chang and Ho told investors:

>*In a multi-asset portfolio, investors can likely add up to 1% of their allocation to cryptocurrencies in order to achieve any efficiency gain in the overall risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio.*

Bitcoin has welcomed major investments from the likes of Paul Tudor Jones, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and MicroStrategy. The endorsement from JPM comes at a time when institutional players are rushing to accumulate the digital asset. As per Bloomberg’s report, America’s oldest bank BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has also announced plans to enable Bitcoin transactions for its clients.

The strategists were quick to add that cryptocurrencies should be viewed as an investment vehicle and opposed to being funding currencies like the USD or EUR. This appears to be contrary to earlier statements from other JPM analysts that called cryptocurrencies the “poorest hedge for major drawdowns in equities.”

post,m0k0yq,,Diminishing bragging rights for the rich and famous from new exotic cars.,"Does anybody else feel like exotic cars are running out of allure?

&nbsp;



Historically exotic (luxury or supercars) always offered 4 things to justify their price tag. Brand name, luxury, styling or performance.

&nbsp;

Luxury used to be easy by having amazing new tech and amenities reserved for likes of RR's, S class and 7 series. Having GPS and a screen with leather was amazing 20 years ago. Now a fully loaded working mans truck can have those and more. Tesla and GM are making luxury manufacturers try to catch up to even have currently desired features of Supercruise/Autopilot that even other luxury brands don't have right now. 

&nbsp;

Performance is also being taken away from being something of the super rich and given to the masses. Things like C8 Corvette and very fast 0-60 EV's are lowering the floor of entry to killing the exclusivity of mind blowing acceleration from only being in Supercars and now being more and more available. Which is likely why the arms race of top speed has been a hot ticket for hyper cars. EV's and things like Hellcat can't brag about 250mph top speed. 


&nbsp;


That leaves styling and brand name as only exclusive monikers. (+ top speed bragging rights). The amount of supercars and their sales numbers are helping dilute the brand name prestige. (How many McLaren models are there now? Ferraris?). Exotic styling gap still exists but things like C8 Corvette certainly help close that gap. 


&nbsp;

A hypercar doing 0-60 in 3 seconds has lost it's allure. This experience used to be only available to those that could afford the most modern hypercar or those willing to ride a motorcycle. Now with Tesla and the new article about Kia doing 0-60 in 3 seconds takes that away as a bragging right for those that love exclusivity. 

&nbsp;

There are few items in a modern luxury car (S class example) that will really make an average owner of a modern car envious over features.",2784,True,1615222354.0,2021-03-08 17:52:34,47,57,vovchandr,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/m0k0yq/diminishing_bragging_rights_for_the_rich_and/,True,0.73,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Backed by $1 million in support from the Ontario government through Ontario's Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network (AVIN) and matched by $1 million investments from Canadian Tire and NuPort Robotics, respectively, the two-year project is applying proprietary, artificial intelligence (AI) technology from NuPort Robotics to retrofit two conventional semi-tractor trailers - which will always be attended by a driver - with high-tech sensors and controls, a touchscreen navigation system, and other advanced features such as obstacle and collision avoidance.

""Ontario is proud to be a global leader in automated and connected vehicle technology and this innovative project is an exciting milestone toward automated vehicle tech in the trucking industry,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""Ontarians rely on goods being delivered by trucks across the province every day and projects like this are demonstrating the ways that automated truck technology could help businesses meet delivery demands more efficiently while supporting a strong supply chain in Ontario.",7365,True,1615581269.0,2021-03-12 21:34:29,23,6,thinkB4WeSpeak,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m3qhl9/canadian_tire_and_nuport_robotics_to/,True,0.81,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

> # 1. Stock futures mixed after Dow, S&P 500 closed at record highs again

> * U.S. stock futures were mixed Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 little changed after they both closed again at record highs to start the week. Nasdaq futures rose Tuesday, adding to Monday’s 1.1% gain, which moved the tech-heavy index to just 4.5% away from last month’s record high close.

> * Stocks were able to shake off the 10-year Treasury yield holding around 1.6% on Monday and Tuesday, after hitting an over one-year high of 1.642% on Friday. Rapidly rising bond yields have recently been a drag on growth stocks as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and compress market valuations.

> # 2. Fed to begin March meeting with polices under scrutiny

> * The Federal Reserve, which begins its two-day March meeting Tuesday, will be watching bond yields and the latest reading on retail sales. Economists expect the government’s February data to show a 0.4% increase in retail sales following a 5.3% surge in January. With the Fed’s extraordinarily easy monetary measures during Covid under scrutiny, the nation’s central bank is set to release new economic and interest rate forecasts along with its policy statement Wednesday afternoon.

post,mdz8t8,,"Tesla is lying. The Model S Plaid won't be able to do 0-60 in under 2s, won't do 1/4 in 9.23s@155mph, and won't go around Laguna Seca in 1:30.3. Not even close...","I am gonna skip condemning Tesla for the moment and go straight to the reasons why I think their claims are implausible enough that I am not afraid to call them lies. 

**1\. 0-60mph in 1.99s**

A few days ago, mostly sick of so many car makers claiming 0-60mph times of under 2s - which are physically impossible to achieve with current street legal tires and with the weight of the cars being well over 1600kg - I set to calculate if the current Model S Performance is tire limited all the way to 60mph. If it was, that would mean that no matter how much power you would add, the 0-60mph times wouldn't change.

The result, calculation of which you can check [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/mbhvqu/the_koenigsegg_gemera_is_a_family_hypercar_with/gs3m9hb/) if you are interested, was that *it is*. For the sake of completeness I should mention that I didn't bother to calculate the wind resistance (which would be around 200N), that there might also be some variance depending on how the dyno was set up, and also that the dyno chart is for the 2017 Model S P100D, not for the current Model S Raven. In any case, the difference is big enough that none of those details should matter to the outcome.

This means that the only way the Plaid could go any faster than the 2.4s (with rollout and *already at a drag strip!*) that the Model S currently does, would be with way wider and grippier tires. And that might very well be the case - we know that the Plaid has wider wheel arches, likely housing wider tires, and that they might go with stickier Cup 2 tires. However, looking at the Porsche Taycan S - which uses 305mm rear tires (compared to the 265mm of the Model S) and does the same 2.4s 0-60 - that's not gonna give you 0.4s, if anything at all. At best, the Plaid could manage 2.3s, 2.2s if we are really stretching it and thinking of the best imaginable scenario. The car is simply too heavy for real soft and sticky tires to be used.

post,metref,,[$BB] The size of the real-world driving datasets that Blackberry IVY has access to will be so much bigger than Tesla's,"A huge reason for Tesla's insane valuation is the fact that Tesla has amassed 3 billion miles of real-world Autopilot data (by comparison, Waymo only has 20 million real-world miles and 10 billion simulation miles). This allows Tesla to be the only automotive company currently that can train vision-based self-driving system in the real world at such a huge scale. Essentially, Tesla is utilizing its users as free labor to train its self-driving system by having the users correct the system whenever it makes a wrong turn.

Blackberry IVY will very soon change the game. By creating a standard data abstraction layer on the 175 million QNX-powered vehicles (and possibly more since IVY is OS-agnostic and will support other non-QNX vehicles), Blackberry IVY will likely become the de-facto industry standard for automakers to share normalized sensor data (camera, radar, lidar, steering wheel rotation, brakes, acceleration etc.) with Autonomous Vehicle software makers (Waymo, Cruise, Argo, Motional, Aurora, TuSimple, Baidu, Pony.AI, Momenta etc.).

By 'sharing', I mean monetizing. De-identified vehicle sensor and localization data will be the most important asset that automakers can monetize in the immediate short term. Blackberry and AWS will be the bridge between the traditional automotive world and the software world by creating programming standards, interface and data marketplaces.

Just imagine this, Tesla only has **<2 million** vehicles on the road currently and they are already called a Big Data company and world-leading ""self-driving car"" company (debatable, I personally think anything under L4 autonomy is ADAS, not self-driving). 

Imagine what Blackberry IVY can help the automakers and AV software makers achieve with normalized data from **>175 million** vehicles.",3453,True,1616902891.0,2021-03-28 05:41:31,238,62,Character-Cup-2263,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/metref/bb_the_size_of_the_realworld_driving_datasets/,True,0.85,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,mg91ws,,Tesla and Toyota Are Considering Jointly Developing a Small Electric SUV Platform,"Choi Won-seok reports in the Korean Ghosun Libo news publication that according to an official from the Japanese automotive industry Toyota and Tesla have been reviewing the partnership since last year and are approaching the final stage.

Here are some of the highlights of Toyota Tesla partnership. When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV EV at low cost using the Toyota platform.

The Ghosun IIbo is the biggest newspaper in SK. A Tesla source Sawyer Merritt, tweets that he has been told ""the reporter of the story is also highly regarded. We'll see if it's true.""

Toyota provides the vehicle platform to Tesla, and instead, Tesla provides some of the electronic control platform and software technology installed in its vehicle to Toyota.

When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV electric vehicle at low cost using the Toyota platform. In addition, Tesla's sales in Japan, which are around 1,000 units per year, are likely to increase significantly.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said at the 'Battery Day' in September of last year, that Tesla ""will release a $25,000 compact and affordable electric car in 2023. However, among experts, there were several opinions that it would be difficult for Tesla to find a way to sell electric cars at such low prices. Especially considering Tesla has already developed the Model 3 in 2017, The model electric crossover in 2020, the exoskeleton of the Cybertruck and working on the Semi truck. at this moment we have no idea about Tesla's affordable compact vehicle, which now it looks like may be produced in partnership with Toyota, if this report is true.

I think this is a smart move for both Tesla and Toyota. Some people may be skeptical of a Tesla Toyota partnership, but remember that Tesla helped built Toyota RAV4 in 2012. I am sure you guys remember when Toyota sold its Tesla stocks in 2017.

 Jim Chanos’ Kynikos Associates and Jim Carruthers’ Sophos Capital got much smaller in 2020, according to new regulatory filings. 

If there’s any lingering doubt about how awful 2020 was for short sellers, recently released securities filings make the pain abundantly clear.

Jim Chanos’ Kynikos Associates and Jim Carruthers’ Sophos Capital — both of which started 2020 with around $1 billion in regulatory assets — ended the year a shadow of their former selves.

Chanos, arguably the most well-known short seller in the world, lost more than 50 percent of its assets last year. Kynikos ended 2020 with about $405 million in regulatory assets under management, down from around $932 million the prior year, according to annual ADV filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The long bull market has punished Chanos for years. In 2018, when *Institutional Investor* profiled him, Kynikos ran just under $2 billion, having already lost almost three-quarters of his assets since the financial crash of 2008, when it ran $7 billion.

post,mr23nw,,My attempt at EBITDA forecast valuation for Tesla (TSLA),"So I've tried to estimate the 10-year return for holding TSLA shares by projecting growth, margins and EBITDA forward in three scenarios and coming up with an estimated enterprise value and market cap for TSLA in 2030. Hoping to hear some helpful feedback.

Quick disclaimer: I am not a CFA, I don't have a degree in finance (degree in engineering) and this is my first time trying to do this. Obviously don't take this as investment advice.

For the base case scenario, I used analyst estimates for revenue growth in 2021-2023 and then grew it at the rate closer to the projected EV market growth between now and 2027 (22%). I then grew it at 20% for the last 3 years to be conservative. So this is a scenario in which Tesla captures more market share for a few years and then maintains that market share. For EBITDA Margin, I maintained it at 20% until 2026 at which point I let it decline by 1 percentage point a year as I'd expect there to be more competition and Tesla to be selling less luxury cars (higher margin) as a percentage of their sales. 

My base case EBITDA projection for 2030 was then 48.45 Billion USD. For a company that is still growing revenues at 20% albeit without high margins, I gave it a EV/EBITDA multiple of 25, resulting in an enterprise value and market cap of 1.2 Trillion dollars. This represents a 1.66x multiple over 10 years on the original investment.

For the bull/optimistic case, I kept the margin at 20% for the next 10 years and kept the growth rate above the 22% market rate for the next 10 years, meaning Tesla is able to maintain their higher than industry margins, perhaps through leasing autopilot software and continues to gain market share. This gave me an 2030 EBITDA of 77.26 Billion USD.

This represents a 1.66x multiple over 10 years on the original investment.

For the bull/optimistic case, I kept the margin at 20% for the next 10 years and kept the growth rate above the 22% market rate for the next 10 years, meaning Tesla is able to maintain their higher than industry margins, perhaps through leasing autopilot software and continues to gain market share. This gave me an 2030 EBITDA of 77.26 Billion USD. With it's continued higher growth rate, I gave it an EV/EBITDA multiple of 30, resulting in an enterprise value and market cap of 2.3 Trillion dollars.

post,n1bxsm,,Overnight test drive on Model Y,"Yesterday I picked up a Model Y Performance for an overnight test drive and I figured I’d put my quick thoughts here since the Tesla subreddit flames anything that’s not pure praise. 

The car has some significant flaws, but also does some things well. I went through it to check the quality and it was as expected (trash), different panel gaps everywhere, my A pillar trim was coming off, body panels felt thin, UI crashed while we were browsing it in a parking lot and power cycled, Autopilot almost hit the curb two or three times. I’m picky with cars I buy, always has to be the right spec even if it takes months, so I wouldn’t be able to live with this level of build. A current gen Acura, Mazda, Lexus all have significantly better fit and finish than this $60k Model Y. 

I was pleasantly surprised with the pickup and the handling. We’re a household that only buys M and AMG cars, last ones being the M2 and C63S, and if the car had better seat bolstering it would be pretty fun to drive in canyons, on par with those imo. The initial launch is slow, less aggressive than ICE cars but I think it’s intentionally mapped that way for traction. But the pickup between 25-75 is nice and really pulls. After around 85-90 is dies down and most other performance cars would pull on it easily. 

One of the parts I was most impressed by was the object recognition on the ADAS side. It would pickup most everything I passed, cones and trash cans too. I liked the little chime it does when lights turn green, and the 3D renders were decent. They’re no where near FSD as autopilot itself is flakey but it’s a start. 

Pros:
- Quick
- Handles decently
- No gas money
- Better than other $50k EVs 
- theater and games on display are nice
- highway LKA is pretty good

Cons:
- Garbage quality
- UI not intuitive 
- Software not completely stable 
- Autopilot kinda sucks anywhere except the highway

post,n8gaku,,Choosing a Lower Trim Level Specifically to Get Physical Knobs and Buttons,"I'm helping my friend shop for a new car. She's not a car person and is looking for a midsize hybrid crossover. We test drove a Kia Sorento hybrid and Toyota Venza.



For both of these cars, I was delighted to find that she shares my opinion on physical knobs and buttons...they're a must-have. I was also saddened to see that the higher-level trims on both cars make things worse in terms of ergonomics and UI.



The larger touchscreen on the Kia moves the tuning knob really far away from the driver, even with her long-ass arms. The physical buttons are changed into ""touchpads.""



And don't even get me started on the Toyota. Their ""premium"" infotainment system does away with both the volume and tuning knobs altogether. If you want to change your satellite radio station from 28 to 53, you have to tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap (BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP) endlessly on the stupid touchpad. The sales rep told me you can ""turn the beeping off."" That was one of the first things I did, and despite specifically turning ""Beep"" to ""off"" in the settings, it persisted.



So, my friend is more than happy to get the lower-level infotainment systems, which are far more user-friendly and usable. As long as she can add leatherette and heated seats, she's a happy camper.



There's a reason that the altitude, speed, and direction of a jet's autopilot system are controlled with knobs. Stop taking them away from us.

I'm based in NZ and use Hatch Invest.

Right now I own a mish mash of stocks, ranging from Apple to Sony to Baba, to VACQ.

I'd like to set my portfolio on somewhat autopilot, with 10-20% for speculative plays (I want to keep my VACQ for eg). I'm bullish on certain plays, and I enjoy the personal picks aspect.

I'm only a few thousand into investing so far, and only put in a couple hundred a month, so now seems like the ideal time to rebalance before moving forward.

So I'm looking at one of the following options, and would love suggestions or reasoning on ratios and combinations:

Option 1:
40% VOO
20% VXF
20% VXUS
20% personal picks

Option 2:

The other interesting part is that it would have been an earnings miss without the trading.

Now that we had our shiny new Shadow Black Mach-E, we wanted to get a good idea of what it was like to live with on a decent road trip.  We intentionally picked an area that wasn't well serviced with Public Charging stations. 

Since we live near Seattle, we chose to do the route suggested by [The Olympic Peninsula Tourism Commission](https://olympicpeninsula.org/road-trips/2-night-trip-from-seattle/)

This take you out and around the Olympic Peninsula for 3 days, 2 nights.

#Pre Planning

We scouted the route with [A Better Route Planner](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/) (thank you /u/RouteBetter) to see what it would suggest since it has an option for the Mach-E 4X.  This said it would be doable, but we would need to rely solely on the one 50kw fast charger in Port Angeles.  However, it would be an out and back route along the north side of the mountain range, charging on the way out and the way back.  We wanted to go south and do the full route the original website suggested. 

Scouting other sources of power in the west side of the peninsula using [Plugshare](https://www.plugshare.com/), we saw that there was a Tesla Supercharging station in Forks, WA where we were staying for a night.  We couldn't use that obviously, however, just next door there was an [RV campground with 50A outlets](https://www.plugshare.com/location/93338) that we could use with the 32A mobile charger the Mach-E comes with.  I called the place and asked if we could use it when we were in town. They happily agreed since they had extra space on that day. 

Now that I had a 2nd place to charge, I broke up the days in to 3 saved trips in the ABRP site.

# The Balance Sheet

>A  balance sheet shows how much a company is worth, also known as the  ""book"" value. It lists the value of a company's assets, liabilities and  shareholders equity.Like the Income Statement, it is often shared on a quarterly or annual basis.

post,nrj6n5,,Would Tesla ever consider acquiring Ford?,"Disclosure: I own Ford stock

Years ago I bought Ford as a value play, back then it appeared undervalued and had a solid dividend for the sector. I feel like Fords F-150 alone is enough to justify owning the stock. Then the pandemic happened, then the chip shortage happened and I have remained patient. 

Now that patience has been rewarded, I keep looking at TSLA and F and wonder why they don't get together. With Ford's diverse product lineup, aggressive move into the EV market and projections of profitability, I think they represent a significant value. I know they are hampered by huge legacy costs, but in todays inflationary environment, I believe those costs are mitigated.  

TSLA is losing market share and their shiny new offering (the cybertruck) is still a long way off. Yet TSLA still has nearly 10x the market cap of Ford. This makes me wonder if TSLA would look to pick off a potential competitor in the EV market, expand their products offerings and create a big splash all at once.",1002,False,1622741927.0,2021-06-03 19:38:47,0,19,3nnui,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nrj6n5/would_tesla_ever_consider_acquiring_ford/,True,0.3,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,nrw7cv,,Biden bans US investment in Chinese military and tech surveillance sectors,"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/03/biden-bans-us-investment-chinese-military-tech-surveillance

Joe Biden has signed an executive order that bans American entities from investing in dozens of Chinese companies with alleged ties to defense or surveillance technology sectors.

In a move that his administration says will expand the scope of a legally flawed Trump-era order, the US treasury will enforce and update on a “rolling basis” the new ban list of about 59 companies.

It also bars buying or selling publicly traded securities in target companies, and replaces an earlier list from the defense department, senior administration officials told reporters.


Chips with everything: how one Taiwanese company drives the world economy

The order prevents US investment from supporting the Chinese military-industrial complex, as well as military, intelligence, and security research and development programs, Biden said in the order.

“In addition, I find that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside [China] and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constitute unusual and extraordinary threats,” Biden said.

A White House fact sheet on the order said the policy would take effect for those companies listed on 2 August.

Major Chinese firms included on the previous defense department list were also placed on the updated list, including Aviation Industry Corp of China (AVIC), China Mobile Communications Group, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC).

SMIC is key to China’s national drive to boost its domestic chip sector.

“We fully expect that in the months ahead … we’ll be adding additional companies to the new executive order’s restrictions,” one of the senior officials said.",4124,True,1622779726.0,2021-06-04 06:08:46,4241,266,ini0n,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nrw7cv/biden_bans_us_investment_in_chinese_military_and/,True,0.97,2021,tesla,top,False,True,0,

If you want to continue the discussion in this thread, I suggest sorting by new. 

Posted below on Saturday.

This sub has been very quiet about discussing Tesla lately it seems. Just getting a status update on what everyone thinks may happen this quarter and in the future.

Just to throw some possibilities around, here are some discussion points. 

What do you expect this quarter? Will it be enough to push Tesla back above $700?

Will having Bitcoin on the balance sheet have an effect on their quarter? It's dropped some but not that much. It will be  slightly negative this quarter, but could bounce back again if Bitcoin runs again.

How do you think the stock will react if Tesla rolls out Full self driving that can drive people to work? The new subscription model is out, so FSDAAS is now an option, how does that effect their revenue next quarter and long term? How soon do you think FSD rolls out to wide release? It's already looking very impressive, but still needs some fine tuning. Will it be v10 or v11 that is capable? Is the processor enough to handle level 4 driving? What will be needed for level 5 FSD? 

How soon will the Austin and Berlin plants open up to production? Are they duplicating problem solving of the 4680 Model Y line between Texas and Germany? Who is farther along? Is Berlin almost ready to go and just delayed by permit processes? Will the new factories be covered in solar panels?

What is the going forward plans for letting other auto manufacturers use the Tesla charging network? Elon just mentioned Tesla will allow other EV's to use their network. Will all new chargers be pass through with 300kwh charging? That will be needed for the cybertruck. How big will their charging network need to grow, and how will that effect their revenue?",4147,True,1627142161.0,2021-07-24 17:56:01,343,479,rideincircles,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oqsosi/what_do_you_expect_for_tslas_2nd_quarter_update/,True,0.88,2021,both,search,False,False,0,

post,oy3v9z,,Tesla AI day scheduled for August 19th.,"With AI Day approaching in a few weeks, Tesla has started sending out invitations to the highly-anticipated event. Tesla’s invitations, including the wording in its RSVP page, suggest that the company may be discussing some interesting topics for AI Day. 

Immediately noticeable in the AI Day invites is an image showing what seems to be a [**stack of computer hardware**](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-dojo-chip-images-dennis-hong/). Very little is known about this yet-to-be-announced hardware, though it was initially teased by legendary mechanical engineer Dennis Hong online. This fueled speculations that the image was likely related to Tesla’s Dojo Supercomputer, which would be used to train Autopilot software. 

A look at the RSVP page for the event shows a rather interesting description of the upcoming event. 

*“Join us in Palo Alto, CA on August 19, 2021, at 5 p.m. PDT. This invite-only event will feature a keynote by Elon, hardware and software demos from Tesla engineers, test rides in Model S Plaid, and more. Attendees will be among the first to see our latest developments in supercomputing and neural network training. They’ll also get an inside look at what’s next for AI at Tesla beyond our vehicle fleet.*

*“If you have received an email invitation for this event, please submit the form below using the same email address to let us know you’d like to attend. Space is limited, and we will be confirming the attendee list closer to the event date. If you are chosen to attend AI Day, you will receive an email confirmation with additional event details.”*

Arguably the most noticeable portion from AI Day’s RSVP page is the sentence referencing what is “next for AI at Tesla beyond our vehicle fleet.” Granted, Tesla is also using its software prowess for its energy products with products like Autobidder, but Elon Musk has also noted in the past that long term, people would likely think of Tesla as an [**AI robotics company**](https://www.thestreet.",2610,True,1628115734.0,2021-08-05 00:22:14,18,11,redmars1234,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oy3v9z/tesla_ai_day_scheduled_for_august_19th/,True,0.66,2021,both,search,False,False,0,

A couple questions I have though.  Can you sell your stake before the company goes public?  How would that work?  Is there a way to prevent people from selling their stake?  How does the 10% interest work?  Do they pay that out each year or something?  Or does it get rolled into the stock?

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking at a somewhat mixed open after we saw the indices push for new ATH to end last week's trading. Berkshire Hathaway reported better-than-expected profit growth for Q2. Tesla delayed cybertruck production until 2022, but the stock is up this morning on a price target upgrade. China has been reacting to various COVID outbreaks, and I fear the US could see more strict measures in the near future as well. This is worth following closely, as any lockdowns or countermeasures could be detrimental to stocks in the short-term, particularly the reopening plays. 

SPY is trading a bit under 442, and we could see some indecision this morning after hitting fresh ATH on Friday. DIA and QQQ are in similar technical levels after hitting fresh ATH in Friday's trading as well. I think we could be in for some choppiness, I'll be keeping an eye on UVXY if we do see some weakness. If we see strength and a push back towards ATH, then the strength should continue. Gold and silver are down a bit this morning, while crude oil is down considerably this morning. This is worth following closely, as crude oil is up quite a bit year-to-date and could see this as a correction.

post,p5o8t3,,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, August 16, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 16, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) remarkably recovering losses early in the session to narrowly eke out a new intraday record high despite massive geopolitical concerns and disappointing economic data coming out of China. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also recovered to finish roughly even while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, was down 0.75% at the time of writing.

China released economic data for July that showed growth rates slow down dramatically as the world’s second largest economy battles with summer flooding and the resurgence of coronavirus thanks to the highly contagious delta variant. Industrial production, a gauge of activity in the manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors, grew by 6.4% year-over-year in July, a sharp deceleration from the 8.3% rise in June and below the 7.9% growth expected. Retail sales, a key measurement of consumer sentiment in the world’s most populous nation, grew by 8.5% in July, way below the 12.1% increase in June and missing the 11.5% expected by economists.

The National Bureau of Statistics noted “the impact of multiple factors including the growing external uncertainties and the domestic COVID-19 epidemic and flooding situation,” according to a release. The bureau added that the “economic recovery is still unstable and uneven.”

In other, very, very sad news, disorder in Afghanistan further weighed on global markets, with chaos erupting in the capital city of Kabul the last few days as civilians tried to flee the country being swiftly overtaken by the Taliban. Amid the pullback of US forces after more than twenty years of being in the country, the Taliban have regained control of the country with terrifying, ruthless swiftness.

post,p5ul1o,,A driver died in a car crash involving a Nio car activated with driver-assistance feature,"Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO were weak Monday after a fatal accident involving a NIO car with self-driving features.  


The fatal crash of a NIO ES8 sport-utility vehicle took place last week in China. The SUV is equipped with several driver assistance functions, including features enabled by Intel (ticker: INTC) division Mobileye, that enable some forms of autonomous driving. NIO’s driver assistance functions are called NIO Pilot and employ cameras as the so-called eyes of the car.  


NIO has other autonomous-driving technology, referred to as NAD, such as radar, lidar—a laser-based radar—and camera vision, as well as computing power provided partly by Nvidia (NVDA) to process all the data points coming at the car.  


The NAD features don’t appear to be available on all NIO vehicles, including the ES8. All autonomous driving systems require the driver to pay attention to the road at all times.  


NIO responded to a request for comment with a Weibo post in Chinese. The post indicates the company is cooperating with police regarding the investigation.  


The global automotive industry is still wrestling with regulatory and branding issues surrounding autonomous technology. Self-driving features, such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assistance, make driving safer as long as systems are used as intended. But drivers might rely too much on the features when systems are dubbed pilot or autopilot. Government safety regulators, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, are still drafting plans to prepare for the introduction of more advanced self-driving features.

Beijing issued the newest implementation plan for Hydrogen Energy Industry development; Auto companies export volume has a YoY increase of 1.2 times; China Evergrande Vice-Chairman Xia Haijun has sold 3 million Evergrande shares; Autonomous driving problems are still being heated.

**Industry News**

On August 16, the Beijing Bureau of economy and information technology formally issued a notice on the ""Beijing Hydrogen Energy Industry Development Implementation Plan (2021-2025)"".

The implementation plan specifies how the hydrogen energy industry in Beijing will develop over the next five years from multiple perspectives.

In addition, according to CAAM statistical analysis, in July 2021, the export volume of auto companies hit a record high, of **which the contribution of new energy auto exports to growth was 31.5%.**

In July 2021, auto companies exported 174,000 vehicles, an MoM increase of 9.8% and a YoY increase of 1.8 times. From January to July 2021, auto companies exported 1.002 million vehicles, a YoY increase of 1.2 times, surpassing the entire year of last year.

Looking ahead, Citigroup said that it is optimistic about the strong fundamentals of the new energy vehicle industry. It is expected that the sales of new energy vehicles in August will increase by 8% month-by-month, or 164% YoY, reaching 266,000; BYD (1211.HK) and Geely (0175.HK) are the two companies with the highest penetration rate of new energy vehicles in the next two years.",4475,True,1629269303.0,2021-08-18 08:48:23,2,2,jiagzh7732,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p6lw3c/chinese_ev_daily_baidu_unveils_first_robocar/,True,0.58,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,peu6y6,,I traded my Tesla for a Mini. Here's why. (Longform),"Disclaimer: Before I begin - if you follow r/cars Tesla posts, there's a solid chance you've seen me. I've been both very positive *and* very critical of Tesla. That said, this is both a LONGFORM and serious/informative post, so if you're only here to make snarky comments without reading, you're better off going elsewhere. That said...

Yes, you read the title right; after owning a Tesla Model 3 for a year, I've decided to ditch it for of all things, a Mini Clubman. Here's what I learned over my year of Model 3 ownership, broken up into pros/cons:

&#x200B;

Pros:

1. The Model 3 is a *superbly* engineered car. The engineers, both hardware and software, very clearly know their stuff. Range is great, and the car is pretty athletic. Straight line speed for the LR was more than anyone could reasonably need, and the steering was extremely direct for a car of its size. The suspension felt a tad sloppy at times, but overall was well enough sorted. There's tons of tech, and it's all easy to use. All of that coming in at a reasonable (for its segment) price? It's a no brainer, and from a technical standpoint, is probably one of the best all-around dailies you can buy. *It's that impressive.*
2. On to the tech... it's brilliant. The one screen to rule them all approach may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it works, and it works very well. After about a week, I could confidently navigate effectively everything I had to use regularly with just a glance to the controls - way, way better than many other infotainments I've used, where common functions are hidden under menus, UI isn't thought out, and responsiveness is... meh. Tesla's app is easy to use, reliable, and is feature packed. Combine that all with regular OTA updates, and over the course of the year I can definitely say my Model 3 was better than when I got it. It's pretty darn cool to have a car that's improving over the course of ownership.",8963,True,1630367303.0,2021-08-31 01:48:23,1804,464,-ZeroF56,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/peu6y6/i_traded_my_tesla_for_a_mini_heres_why_longform/,True,0.9,2021,both,search,False,False,0,

post,phiruh,,"Tesla further delays Cybertruck timeline to late 2022, Roadster delayed until 2023","The Tesla Cybertruck delay was already a known fact, but CEO Elon Musk's latest reported comments add a few more details to the picture. Citing sources familiar with the meeting, Electrek reported Thursday that Musk held a company-wide call and said the Cybertruck should be ready for production in late 2022.

If the company plans for beta trucks later this year, that leaves nowhere near enough time to start actual production in late 2021.

Following his comments, Tesla updated the Cybertruck's reservation page to note production will fire up in 2022. Though, according to Musk, we're not looking at early 2022 or anything like that. And as we suspected, the CEO underscored the electric truck's volume models may not be ready until sometime in 2023. If Tesla follows this timeline, we'll get the priciest tri-motor model in 2022, then the dual- and single-motor trucks in 2023.

Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla has delayed the new Roadster program to 2023, and even then, that’s only going to happen with a big “if.”  
The new electric hypercar is now three years behind its original timeline.  
When first unveiling the next-generation Tesla Roadster in 2017, Musk said that it will come to market in 2020.

Tesla started taking reservations for the impressive electric supercar with a 0-60 mph in 1.9 seconds and over 600 miles of range at the unveiling event.  
People who wanted to be first in line to get the vehicle had to put down between $50,000 and $250,000 in deposits.  
The vehicle program was later delayed, as the CEO said that it wasn’t a priority for Tesla.

Let's start with the bad about the Model Y. First, the suspension. The Model Y is a very firm vehicle, it's not like a cushion or a pillow ride like some air suspension vehicles have. My friend has a Q8, which is way better than my Model Y. Another bad is the road-trip ability/charging. The supercharger network is praised upon by many people transitioning to Tesla vehicles but in my experience, it's been a mixed bag. I never felt like I would run out of range and always made it to my destination/supercharger with at least 10% battery. Supercharging is annoying. I made a trip to Houston and back in my Model Y and there are 3 charging stops along the way. The way it's mapped you have 2 options. If you stop at the first charger (Corsicana TX) you would have to stop at the 3rd Charger (Huntsville TX) otherwise you wouldn't make it. You may be thinking ok just go to the charger in the middle and have one-stop. That's even worse because Tesla only put 4 stalls at that location. On the way to Houston, I had 4 cars AHEAD of me. I waited 30 min just to get a spot, it was fine 25 min and I'd be on my way. I was kinda annoyed because a trip that takes 4 hrs 30 took close to 5 and a half hours pretty much. On the way back I figured I'd go to the outer two chargers, guess what happened, another wait, at both. The first one was a 15-minute wait then a 10-minute charge. The second one was a 10-minute wait with a 10 min charge. I guess a pro of taking the Tesla vs my Lexus was the charging was free, I got 2,000 free supercharging miles when I bought my vehicle. The big topic with Tesla though is Build quality. Oh boy, build quality is very inconsistent with Tesla. Originally I had a VIN for my vehicle which I was supposed to take delivery mid-august.",6058,True,1631068411.0,2021-09-08 04:33:31,86,61,PangolinEffective,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/pk1q6p/model_y_1_year_review/,True,0.77,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

>Oct 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surpassed $1 trillion in market value on Monday after landing its biggest-ever order from rental car company Hertz, a deal that reinforced the electric car leader's ambitions to top the entire auto industry in sales over the next decade.

>Tesla shares surged as much as 14.9% to $1,045.02, making it the world's most valuable automaker according to Reuters calculations based on its latest filing.

>Even Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk expressed surprise at the velocity of the surge. ""Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem,"" Musk tweeted in reply to a comment by Ross Gerber, co-founder of the investment fund Gerber Kawasaki and a Tesla shareholder.

>""Wild $T1mes!"" Musk wrote in a separate tweet.

>Tesla is the first carmaker to join the elite club of trillion-dollar companies that includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).

>Most automakers do not boast about sales to rental car companies, often made at discounts to unload slow-selling models.

>""Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,"" Hertz interim Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters.

post,qi92fg,,"I made $500,000 trading stocks and options in 18 months. These are the 15 things I did that worked best.","I failed a lot while trading before, during, and after succeeding. I haven’t counted it up, but it’s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I’m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I’d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. 

These are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.

**Understand the Trading Environment**

One mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.

**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can’t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. 

In between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that’s more likely to pull back.  It’s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).

I try not to get caught by these patterns.

post,qmjr7o,,"Tesla sells 1% of cars globally, yet is priced more than the companies combined that sell the other 99%","The valuation on Tesla is now beyond the absurd.  

Whilst European EV sales explode to presently 19% of all car sales this year, Tesla does not even make the top five EV sellers by company at a lowly 7%. (VW 25%; Stellantis 13%; Daimler 10%; BMW 10%; Hyundia-Kia 9%).

Tesla, unlike in the US, is simply being outsold by the vast array of alternative BEV models on sale particularly.  VW group alone offers the e-up, ID3 and ID4 (ID5 not yet on sale); Audi e-tron, e-tron Sportback e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT; Cupra Born; and Skoda Enyaq

In China Tesla has been pushed into 3rd place this year by BYD which has seen EV sales grow from 53K Q1; 98K.Q2; 183K Q3.  Tesla meanwhile has seen China quarterly sales for 2021 flattish at 69K, 62K and 75K.  China will likely sell 3 million EV's this year, half the worlds volume and Tesla sales are flat for the year.  Tesla might sell a lowly 9%.

Tesla dominates the US markets of course, where few EV models are on sale.  EV sales might be 3% of automotive sales.

Whilst investors will assert these stats do not.matter and Tesla's valuation is all about  tech, batteries and robo-taxis, it still does not sell any car related tech beyond its own cars.  Take up of FSD is a lowly 11%.  It still buys it's battery cells.  By its own statements it has a level 2/3 driver assist whilst companies like Waymo are already starting to offer level 4/5 robo-taxis in cities like San Fran (a free trial program has commenced).

With Tesla slipping badly in the two biggest and mature EV markets globally, it's EV mkt share has fallen from near 18% highs in 2019 to 14.7% YTD in 2021.  With Europe and China likely to see 20% EV sales, the Tesla domination of global car mkts story is looking utterly flawed, yet its market capitalisation is now than the entire companies combined that sell 99% of cars and are adding EV's faster.

post,qmllp4,,RIVN IPO on November 10,"Rivian is set to have a high profile IPO. Their S1-A prospectus released on Nov 1 is available here:
https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-315537/


**THE IPO FUNDAMENTALS**

Some key elements to pull out of here:

* 861M shares total
* 155M shares available during IPO (135M for public, 20M for underwriters)
* PT of $62

This gives RIVN a market cap of $55Bn with the goal of raising $8Bn in funding during this IPO.

**THE COMPANY FINANCIALS**

Right now, RIVN has zero revenue. Consider them like QuantumScape. They're set to release product soon, but they have no commercialized product currently.

In 2020, they racked up total operational net losses of $1Bn. In 2021, they're on track for net losses of $2Bn. These are all costs associated with what they term as ""Research and development"" and ""Selling, general, and administrative"".

Their goal is to operate in the truck market initially, focusing on consumer truck/SUV vehicles and then delivery fleet vehicles (EDV). This is similar to what WKHS/RIDE were trying to accomplish.

The S1 has RIVN projecting Amazon buying 100,000 EDVs from them, and growing the preorders of their R1T and R1S consumer models.

**THE PRODUCT**

RIVN is focusing on the SUV/Truck market, and this makes sense for America as trucks and SUVs consistently outsell all other vehicles on the road. Based on reviews, the R1T is ranked at 4th place comparing against other EVs by Car and Driver:
https://www.caranddriver.com/rivian/r1t

The R1T looks like a truck, and is designed very much to provide the culturally American truck experience. With the Cybertruck delayed into 2022, RIVN may have the first mover advantage, but again its hard to compare to TSLA who is just a runaway behemoth and cult brand at this point.

Car and Driver's review glow about Rivian's offroad and rugged capabilities. It really seems to live up to the hype. Though there are worries about battery efficacy compared to the ModelX.

post,r0m3yh,,I regret buying a Tesla and I haven't driven a single mile yet.,"This isn't a post about charging or the lack of physical buttons. 

This is a post about a complete lack of customer service. 

I preordered a Model 3 LR three months ago. I was given a delivery window of Mid November to mid December. I got a message last week saying it was my turn to pick up my car. Sweet. They give me a choice of three days on their website to pick up the car. November 24, 25, 26. I find it a bit odd that thanksgiving they are open but I'm working on the 24th and the 26th and on such short notice I can't get out of work. So I put down delivery for the 25th. After all other stores are open on thanksgiving and the site blacked out other dates. 

I get messages from Tesla that I need to get my car insurance and pay the down payment or I won't be able to get the car. No problem. 

I pay the down payment via their app and get the insurance. I upload the proof to their app. All good. 

Then yesterday on 11/22/2021 I get a phone call at 3 pm saying that I can no longer pick up the car on 11/25 because they aren't actually open. 

Uh ok. So you tell me this after I put down the down payment and pay for the insurance. I'm a little pissed at this point but I get it. Let me pick it up another day then. And why didn't you tell me sooner?

They would only let me pick the 24th or 26th. That's it. I asked them can I pick up the car on December 2nd because I have work and can't reschedule or get someone to cover me on such short notice. Their response is ""no, we can't hold the car that long. We will give your car to someone else and you can wait another 3-4 weeks for another car to come in.""

The heck? They made the mistake. Took my money. Made me buy insurance for a car that I don't actually have and then they try to bully me into a specific delivery date on short notice? That's not fair.

post,r475zh,,Why will stock markets fall drastically in 2021?,"Below are a few characteristics of big bubbles…

-Insanely high equity valuations.
Everyone is long risky/speculative assets.
The average retail investor who doesn’t do any research can buy any stock and make money.

-General price acceleration, along with insane price acceleration in different areas (Tesla, GameStop, Bitcoin, and etc.).

-Buy-in on central banks’ ability and willingness to bail everyone out.
While I could be wrong, I don’t think the trigger is really there for the bubble to pop. According to a research report by Bank of America:

“The global economy has maintained momentum into the new year, with expectations of 5.3% expansion this year, the strongest since 1973, up from 3.4% contraction in 2020.”

Under normal circumstances, there’d be a trigger for the bubble to pop, but we are NOT in a standard market regime.

The world has gone autopilot on quantitative easing (QE), which means creation of new money in order to help the economy.

This surplus-free liquidity, which is currently growing at 55% year-over-year in the U.S., is a lot higher than the 32% growth in liquidity after the 2008 crash.

Unlike in 2008, this time, monetary policy will team up with the fiscal side and really drive inflation to an extreme.

Just look at how the Fed’s balance sheet is at 42% of GDP.
The more central banks expand their balance sheet, the higher the stock market goes.

Remember the CARES Act, and now Biden calling for another $1.9T fiscal stimulus (more to come, I guarantee it)?

This is all NEW MONEY created that will flow into the real economy.

post,rabn27,,Rental review: 2021 Tesla Model 3 Performance. Wow I get the hype now.,"This past weekend I took a trip to Florida to both visit family near Palm Beach and spend some time in Miami. I decided to make things more interesting by renting a Tesla on Turo instead of just renting an Altima or whatever from the airport. I had never driven an electric car before, let alone a Tesla, and had some preconceived notions about Teslas in general. I had plenty of opinions, many of which negative, mostly formed by reading reviews, watching Youtube Videos, and general discourse on /r/cars. I wouldn't say I was a Tesla *hater* but as someone who generally prefers a more analog driving experience this seemed like the antithesis of what I generally want in a car. However I definitely was curious and I knew it would be a unique experience unlike anything I've had before in my long time as a car enthusiast. 

I found my 2021 Model 3 Performance on Turo amongst a sea of base model 5 year old Model S's and booked it. This was also my first time using Turo and fortunately everything went well there but this review is about the car so I won't go into it further.

First impressions: 

Holy shit this thing is a spaceship. This is something straight out of a sci-fi movie. The minimalist interior has garnered many criticisms from a practicality standpoint, but it definitely has the visual impact they were going for. 

The screen:

Arguably the giant tablet in the most important part of the car, because it's how you interact with literally everything. And I mean literally everything. Physical controls are limited to two stalks, two steering wheel tumbwheels, window switches, door openers, and a hazard button. 

For the most part the UI is excellent but there were definitely some things that were difficult to find and needlessly complex. I wanted to reset the trip odometer so I can keep track of the miles during the rental. Well I couldn't find one. I couldn't find an odometer at all actually although I'm certain one was in there somewhere.

post,ravhtu,,"Rivian is the one that could disrupt Tesla, analysts say","A flurry of Wall Street ratings boosted Rivian Automotive Inc. stock on Monday, nearly a month after the company went public, with analysts giving the Amazon-backed electric-vehicle maker mostly bullish endorsements.

Of the 13 analysts surveyed by FactSet, eight set ratings on Rivian that were the equivalent of buy, while the other five rated it the equivalent of hold. There are so far no bears. The average price target on the stock was $134.42, which was about 28% above Friday’s stock closing price of $104.67, and about 72% above the $78 initial public offering price.

The stock RIVN, +11.57% surged more than 4% on Monday, putting it on track to snap a four-session losing streak. It was now trading 37% below its Nov. 16 high close of $172.01, but was still 39% above its IPO price. **Baird analyst George Gianarikas initiated Rivian at outperform with a $150 stock price target**, saying he believes the company can “formidably challenge” Tesla Inc.’s TSLA, -0.59% market dominance. He said the company has adopted a “promising, vertically integrated approach,” reinforced by a robust balance sheet, Amazon partnership and strong recruitment.

“Vertical integration, however, requires scale to extract benefits, and, as such, Rivian needs to ramp quickly and effectively to materialize as a serious long-term contender,” Gianarikas wrote in a note to clients. “That is, Clark Kent (\[Chairman and Chief Executive\] RJ Scaringe) needs to emerge from the phone booth as Superman soon to scale Rivian and save the planet.”

post,rmbhqh,,My extensive Porsche Taycan Turbo Review,"My Model 3 AWD lease is about to end. While I generally have positive things to say about my Tesla experience, my Tesla hasn’t exactly been scratching my itches as a car enthusiast. So I am currently at a bit of a crossroads, buy another Tesla and get an affordable-ish sports car. Or combine the funds into one nicer vehicle. 

The problem with the one nicer vehicle is the fact that it does need to be EV. While I am sure a lot of great EV vehicles will burst onto the scene in the next three years, there’s really only one car on the market currently that feels like it might be an upgrade from my Tesla while also satiating my enthusiast desires and that is the Porsche Taycan. 

Now I’ll be honest in saying that I am by no means a Porsche fan. I drove a 997 911 Turbo as well as a 718 Cayman base and I walked away from both cars feeling like they were sports cars on Xanax. They just weren’t exciting for me. 

Likewise, I am by no means a Tesla fanboy. I think they have EV offerings that make a lot of sense, but as a car enthusiast I do long for something that feels a bit more special. 

Unfortunately when reading comparisons between Tesla’s and Taycan’s they pretty quickly devolved into descriptions that felt too simple to me. “If you want a well built car with a great driving experience get the Taycan” “If you want a good charging network, like technology, and need lots of range get a Tesla” While I knew both of those general sentiments to be inherently true, I felt like they were leaving out a lot of details and that the folks righting these statements were inherently pro Tesla or pro Taycan making it hard to find what felt like an unbiased opinion. 

Fortunately I found myself on vacation and in a position to rent a Porsche Taycan Turbo from Turo so I jumped on the opportunity to see whether it would be more compelling than another Tesla and a dedicated sports car.",33768,True,1640197815.0,2021-12-22 19:30:15,665,98,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/rmbhqh/my_extensive_porsche_taycan_turbo_review/,True,0.9,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,rwpnpf,,The tesla V11 Update is Starting to Make me Regret my Model 3 Purchase,"I've owned my 2022 M3LR for about a month, I've put 1600 miles on it around the PNW and overall it's been a good ownership experience. Things work (more on that), the seats are comfy, heater is awesome, fast charging is incredible, low maintenance, ride is smooth and quiet.

I am coming to this car from a 2014 Porsche Cayman S. I did months of research, I even rented a 2020 M3LR FSD in LA. I cross shopped between a Porsche Macan GTS and Volvo V60 T8 Polestar. I ultimately decided the Tesla was for me, I have wanted a Model S since I saw one back in 2014 so it felt natural. I also liked some of the maintenance  advantages of an EV. I jumped into the deep end and installed a wall charger myself.

Delivery and everything was great, the buying experience couldn't have been more flawless. The car has some QC issues, which I expected. But the first thing that felt off was that the passenger lumbar was missing, my wife has a bad back and actually uses the cars lumbar support, support informed me they removed it ""because no one used it"". On the drive back on the interstate we experienced some mild ""phantom braking"" during our first time using autopilot. No big deal it was rainy and wet. Come Christmas, we load up and head to my parents house in North Central Washington. We are driving on two lane highway and we experience harsh phantom braking, like standing on the brakes hard, even in regular cruise control the car will panic and slam on the brakes. This is absolutely a safety hazard to the public and should not be available in cars if it isn't tested properly. Even in perfect dry conditions the car brakes so hard it could cause an accident for no reason. We started using auto pilot and cruise control only on interstates but with my foot over the accelerator to override the stupid ""emergency braking"" feature.

post,sdfxdq,,I'm getting rid of my 2021 Tesla Model 3 Long Range after 6 months of ownership. Here's why:,"I decided to lease a Tesla Model 3 Long Range (through my company) in June of 2021. After 6 months, I've decided that I absolutely hate the car. Here's why:

* Autopilot isn't nearly as good as I expected. It works well under one condition: you are on the freeway on a clearly marked lane with no lanes splitting or merging into your lane. The Tesla has SLAMMED on the brakes while going 70MPH on the freeway because the carpool lane split into two lanes and the Tesla didn't know how to navigate it. Also it will brake if someone inches toward your lane and grazes the lane marker, even if they don't merge. It also won't see people obviously merging into your lane, and will brake late once the car is fully in the lane. If you attempt to change lanes to pass someone, adaptive cruise control will start braking as you are diagonally passing the car because it thinks you're going to hit the car (even if you're 3+ car lengths back) and attempting to pass. The system is overly cautious and is way worse than I expected.

* Using the screen to control everything is mind-bogglingly frustrating. Everything is *juust* out of reach while your back is against the seat, and the screen can't pivot towards you. So you not only have to take your eyes off the road for way too long to find anything you also have to reach to tap it. And since the icons/buttons are relatively small, if you're driving while trying to tap something, small bumps in the road will make it nearly impossible to tap the correct selection on the first try. You have to stabilize your hand on the edge of the screen. Contrasting with Apple Car Play, which has big, widely separated icons that are easy to tap/navigate, this is just bad.

* The Siri-like voice-activated controller is terrible. Especially when trying to call people, even someone on my favorites or someone I've called a million times. E.g. ""Call Joe Shmoe"" ""...calling Shannon Example.",8832,True,1643229876.0,2022-01-26 21:44:36,3535,1089,freakshoww,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/sdfxdq/im_getting_rid_of_my_2021_tesla_model_3_long/,True,0.92,2022,both,search,False,False,0,
post,sdggsx,,Tesla earnings are out – here are the numbers,"Tesla reported fourth-quarter earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings (adjusted): $2.54 vs $2.36 per share expected, per Refinitiv

Revenue: $17.72 billion vs $16.57 billion expected, per Refinitiv

Revenue rose 65% year over year in the quarter, while net income, at $2.32 billion, was up some 760%, according to a statement.

Tesla reported a 27.4% gross margin, compared with 26.6% in the previous quarter.

“Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through 2022,” the company said.

The report comes in the midst of the most important tech earnings season in years. The Nasdaq has suffered its worst January since 2008 as many investors have begun to sour on the promise of high-growth tech stocks.

In 2021, Tesla delivered 936,172 vehicles, an 87% increase versus 2020 when it reported its first annual profit on deliveries of 499,647. Its 2021 deliveries included 308,600 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter. (Deliveries are the closest approximation to sales reported by Tesla.)

CEO Elon Musk and other execs are expected to give a progress update on the company’s long-delayed heavy duty Semi truck, experimental Cybertruck pickup, and plans for driverless vehicle systems and a $25,000 compact car.

With factories being built in Austin, Texas, and Brandenburg, Germany, shareholders also want to know when high-volume vehicle production and deliveries are expected to start at each plant.

Tesla’s guidance may be tempered by supply chain issues, if Musk’s tweets are any indication. On November 29, 2021, he wrote on Twitter, “Oh man, this year has been such a supply chain nightmare & it’s not over! I will provide an updated product roadmap on next earnings call.”

post,smyvxo,,My experience renting a Tesla Model 3 for a week: why the 10 minute test drive at dealerships is useless,"I realize I'm not the first one to post about the Tesla driving/user experience, but I figure everyone has comes from a different background with a different perspective, so here's my best attempt at  reporting my experience.

I decided to spend a weekend down in Florida with family that live there. The problem is, the person I'm visiting doesn't have a car, and it would be much more difficult to do anything to rely on them for transportation, so renting a car was the obvious choice.

I've used Turo a handful of times. I've never used a traditonal rental car company myself, but I've seen the pain and suffering that is trying to arrange for one at a kiosk; not to mention I wanted to drive a car that wasn't a total bore. I looked around on Turo in the area I'm staying in and found a Dual Motor Model 3 for $80 a day. Given the rates of Teslas in the area on Turo, this one was a steal for the asking rate; particularly being a long range dual motor.

Pickup was as seamless as it possibly could have been. The host was prompt, super polite, and showed up with a spotless car and healthy battery charge. Absolutely Zero wait time.

Now comes the meat and potatoes: the experience behind the wheel. This is gonna be a bit backwards from most people, as I essentially had to start driving straight away upon getting the car (received it at arrivals). Casual acceleration felt pretty familiar to me, as my daily is an Accord Hybrid. Zero noise, gradual, smooth, and linear torque. Steering was surprisingly heavy given that I was in comfort mode to start off.

post,st09kt,,$TSLA Bullish price is 287USD (DD),"No emotions, minimum speculations, just raw impartial numbers. We will answer once and for all what is the fair value of TSLA.

&#x200B;

**Chapter 1. Bull thesis (and other lies I tell myself?)**

&#x200B;

Let's start with the typical bull thesis. The one you have probably encountered many times in the wilderness of reddit or twitter. It goes like this:

&#x200B;

* Tesla's car sales will grow 50% annually for foreseeable future. Eventually reaching annual production rate of 20M by 2030. Source: [Technoking himself](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393)

&#x200B;

* Net margins will stay as high or even grow further from the latest 13.1% (Q4 2021). Commonly cited reasons are 4680, Gigacasting... maybe even Alien Dreadnought?

&#x200B;

* Tesla is a tech company. They will generate tons of revenue by selling software such as ~~Fraud~~ Full-Self-Driving, and might eventually launch their own marketplace (see AppStore).

&#x200B;

* Tesla is... *ETF**?* (cannot add a link to youtube video, but it is from solving the money problem)

&#x200B;

* Tesla ~~sex~~bot. Enough said.

&#x200B;

Let's start with an automotive sales part:

&#x200B;

* Say Tesla is such Gigachad^(TM) that it reaches 20M sales without reducing the prices or introducing the cheaper model(s). According to Q4 2021 Financial Report, current **ASP is $50.7K**, derived as auto revenue excl. regulatory credits divided by the number of delivered cars. Assuming 3% average inflation for the next 9 years (incl. current spike) the ASP in 2030 would be **$66.2K** (50.7 x 1.03\^9)

&#x200B;

* With **net margins of 13%** that would result in **66.2K x 20M x 0.13 = $172B net income**.

&#x200B;

* Eventually growth by 2030 will taper and converge to automotive industry average. As of writing, PEs of auto peers: Toyota - 9.64, Volkswagen - 6.88, Ford - 10.10, GM - 7.10, BMW - 4.75. But Tesla being Tesla, so we award an automotive **Tesla PE of 15**.",23886,True,1644922159.0,2022-02-15 11:49:19,261,575,Spare-Help562,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/st09kt/tsla_bullish_price_is_287usd_dd/,True,0.63,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

post,t2t94u,,My Experience with Tesla (2 months in),"  Hello, I really just need to get this off my chest as I’ve had an absolutely horrible experience with Tesla so far and I’m kind of at a loss for how to proceed. Since taking delivery of my M3LR on December 20th it has just been one issue after another. It seems that there is no accountability within Tesla and they have no interest in making the situation right for me. It has been 2 months, I currently have no heat in my car and had to book my 3rd service appointment for this issue, among others. I live in Winnipeg, Canada, and having no heat is beyond unacceptable. Sorry for the incoming wall of text.

Here is a rundown on how my Tesla experience has been.

· December 20th, 2021 – Took delivery, noticed a couple small issues – a gouge in the dash, a misshapen rear head rest. No big deal, it can all get fixed after I get it home. I had around a 12 hour drive to get home, and immediately after getting on the highway I noticed that the rear passenger side window was not sealing, causing very loud wind noise in the cabin. I called in to my sales rep, and his answer was that this is normal and I just need to open it and close it a bunch of times to fix it. I asked him to help me book a service appointment, he said no, as this was a “normal issue”. 

· On the way home I had my first instance of the heat failing. I lost heat completely on the highway and my HVAC was blowing cold air. This caused my windows to frost over so I could not see. This was extremely dangerous and I had to find somewhere to pull over. After doing a reset on the car it came back on (around 30 minutes later).

· This issue persisted, and I had to book a service appointment to get it fixed. Side note, I cannot book a local service appointment. The app makes me book for the service center in Minneapolis and then send a message requesting to have it sent to my local service team.",10095,True,1645983230.0,2022-02-27 18:33:50,35,44,CMusky,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/t2t94u/my_experience_with_tesla_2_months_in/,True,0.71,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

post,u4ht6s,,Twitter board adopts ‘poison pill’ after Musk’s $43 billion bid to buy company,"**Note:** The term poison pill refers to a defense strategy used by a target firm to prevent or discourage a potential hostile takeover by an acquiring company. Potential targets use this tactic in order to make them look less attractive to the potential acquirer: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/poisonpill.asp

**Article:**

https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/15/twitter-board-adopts-poison-pill-after-musks-43-billion-offer-to-buy-company.html

Twitter adopted a limited duration shareholder rights plan, often called a “poison pill,” a day after billionaire Elon Musk offered to buy the company for $43 billion, the company announced Friday.

The board voted unanimously to adopt the plan.

Under the new structure, if any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of at least 15% of Twitter’s outstanding common stock without the board’s approval, other shareholders will be allowed to purchase additional shares at a discount.

The plan is set to expire on April 14, 2023.

Such a move is a common way to fend off a potential hostile takeover by diluting the stake of the entity eying the takeover.

“The Rights Plan will reduce the likelihood that any entity, person or group gains control of Twitter through open market accumulation without paying all shareholders an appropriate control premium or without providing the Board sufficient time to make informed judgments and take actions that are in the best interests of shareholders,” the company said in a press release.

Twitter noted that the rights plan would not prevent the board from accepting an acquisition offer if the board deems it in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.

Musk already owns a more than 9% stake in Twitter as revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week. Soon after his stake became public, Twitter’s CEO announced plans for Musk to join the board. But days later, Musk reversed course and decided not to join the board after all.",3693,True,1650056742.0,2022-04-15 23:05:42,1778,231,cookingboy,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/u4ht6s/twitter_board_adopts_poison_pill_after_musks_43/,True,0.96,2022,both,search,False,True,0,

post,v1ar13,,Rented an EV6 - comparing it to my Model 3,"I rented a Kia EV6 long range RWD (Wind edition I think) off of turo since my tesla model 3 is STILL at the service center (12 days and counting) and I wasn't given a loaner or rental credits.

Overall I'm extremely impressed with the Kia.  Its build quality and road noise levels are FAR superior to my tesla model 3.  Even though it wasn't the GT line, it was still very quick and fun.  It felt bigger than my model 3 for sure, and harder to tell where the corners of the car were, but perhaps I'd get used to that over time.  Feels more like you're in an SUV than it looks in photos.

Its driver assist tech is almost as good as autopilot.  Its navigation system is not as good as tesla's, but apple carplay helps solve that. 

It seems like tesla achieves their range advantage by really skimping on noise insulation and materials.  After experiencing the Kia, I think I prefer a quieter ride and a little less range.  The kia also is much more forgiving on rough pavement, which is most of america, but still felt very sporty.

The main area that my tesla is far better is  - driving position.  I'm 5'9"" and if I put the EV6's wheel in a comfortable place, it completely blocks all the info in the instrument cluster and all I can see is the useless car animation graphic.   In order to see all the important info, I'd have to raise the wheel up to a goofy high level like I'm driving a school bus.  This seems like such a massive design flaw and I can't believe it made it to production.  Reading others' reviews, it seems this is a huge problem for some owners, and no problem at all for others.  I wish the wheel would go lower to be more comfortable too.  There also wasn't anywhere to rest either elbow with my hands on the wheel. 

As poor as the quality has been on my model 3, the driving position is the best of any car I've ever owned.   I won't be buying another tesla due to it's quality, but due to the EV6's poor driving ergonomics, I know I won't be buying one of those either.",2172,True,1653947205.0,2022-05-30 23:46:45,112,102,teslacometrue,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/v1ar13/rented_an_ev6_comparing_it_to_my_model_3/,True,0.9,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,v290yl,,"CA to CT, 3100 miles in 5 days, for $120: first big EV road trip","**Quick stats**

* '22 Model 3 LR AWD, Aero wheels
* 3100 miles \* 227 Wh / mi = 704 kWh
* \~50% DC fast charging, \~50% free Level 2 charging
* DC fast charging \~350 kWh at $.34 / kWh = $120 ($0.038 / mi)
* \~65 mph average speed, around 10h per day driving

&#x200B;

**Overview**

I've crossed the country more times than I can remember, but this was my first time doing so in an EV. And it was awesome! High flight prices inspired me to see how little I could spend while still completing the drive in 5 days (about as fast as I'd typically do it solo).

Essentially, this ended up forming the question: If I knew I had access to e.g. an 8 kW free charger for the whole route, how many miles could I drive in a day, and what was the optimal speed for getting the most out of BOTH charging and driving? Many python scripts later, and I found that charging on average 16 kW and driving 65 - 70 mph would allow me to cover 750 miles per day, more than enough to get me coast to coast in 5 days.

As an aside, if your road trip involves days with <400 mi driving, it's not so difficult to drive for free indefinitely with the right car, assuming you can find decent free chargers.

**Method**

I drove around 10 hours per day and followed the ABCs of EV road trips when not driving: always be charging. So where, when, and for how long?

* Make certain that you can charge overnight. Arrive on a low battery, leave with a full one, and try not to sit idle for longer than necessary.
* Finding a fast free charger (>10 kW in my case) meant I tried to stick around as long as I reasonably could. Grab food, maybe nap, go for a walk, etc. Unless you're driving 16 hours per day, you'll have to stop anyway and might as well do so optimally.
* Try to optimize where cheap DC fast chargers are with where you can charge for free. Gas prices are mostly consistent within a few hundred miles, but DC charger rates can vary by 50% or more. Don't get stuck paying $0.",4528,True,1654059317.0,2022-06-01 06:55:17,36,13,TheMagic1415926535,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/v290yl/ca_to_ct_3100_miles_in_5_days_for_120_first_big/,True,0.89,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,vnxe9o,,TSLA seems to be priced fairly right now,"Apologies for making yet another tesla post but I feel like this is worth discussing.

At the time of writing this post TSLA is worth $685.47 with a market cap of $710B. I don't own any shares of Tesla at all. 

My claim is that at this price and point in time the stock seems to be priced fairly and arguably is a pretty decent buy.  

My reasoning: 

1. Extreme growth: They have a 51% revenue CAGR starting with the realease of the model s in 2013 up until last year. This year they will probably have another 50% growth and <<probably>> another 50% in 2023. The point is that so far over the long run TSLA has grown extremely quickly and consistently. They will also have new models such as Semi, cybertruck and roadster arriving <<probably>> next year. AND they sell their cars with excellent margins. So their growth is very sustainable. 
2. Diverse and unique side businesses: As of this moment tesla gets the vast majority of its revenue and profit from selling cars, thats undeniable. But they have a lot of aspirations. Firstly, energy storage is going to be cruicial in transitioning the world to sustainable energy and tesla is at the forefront of this industry and are therefore in a prime position to capitalize on that. Secondly tesla is dabbling with insurance and juding by their lates report that business unit seems to be breaking even and soon will become profitable. It has only launched in a few states so far and there is a lot of room to grow. Solar shignles and solar in general is also another potential area for growth although tesla doesn't seem to be prioritizing it.  
3. Autonomy: Elon has many times over estimated his own timelines so this point is a little weak BUT if tesla does indeed manage to actually get FSD working properly (im guessing 2025 is the year where they start driving tens of thousands of kilometers without any issues) then tesla is poised to make a ridiculous amount of money.",3838,True,1656556752.0,2022-06-30 04:39:12,0,69,Mr_Axelg,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vnxe9o/tsla_seems_to_be_priced_fairly_right_now/,True,0.3,2022,both,search,False,False,0,
post,vs6eou,,Short term review of IONIQ 5 SE RWD and comparison with Model 3 & Y,"TL;DR : 8/10 Car, competitive with Tesla offerings but also some very mind baffling design decisions. Good buy if $5K cheaper than Model 3.

My wife got a ridiculously good early lease return offer for her 2020 Leaf SV so we took it. She did need another car, and we decided to take advantage of the federal EV tax credit as well as CVRP to get an IONIQ 5. Note that if these were not available (Tesla is eligible for neither now) or if Tesla had no wait time, we probably would have just bought a Model 3 SR+. We currently still own a 2021 Model Y LR, previously owned a 2018 Model 3 LR RWD, and have driven a 2017 Model S 75D quite a bit as well as the Leaf we just returned and have test driven most of the other EV offerings out there, so we have a broad range of EV experience.

MSRP was 45K, with a 4k markup and a 3K mandatory service contract for a total of 53K+Tax. We will get 9.5K back in tax credits and rebates for an effective price of 44K. Dealers playing games made the overall experience annoying after being spoiled by one button ordering with Tesla.

Driving and Handling 9/10:

I'm not going to compare 0-60 to the Model Y AWD as that would be unfair. Compared to the Model 3 RWD, the initial throttle is much more gentle, with more progression in the mid and end throttle curve. The Ioniq is more gentle and comfortable especially for family and passengers, at the cost of responsiveness, even in the ""sport"" driving setting. The Ioniq breaks traction easier when accelerating.

The suspension on the Ioniq however is much softer and easier on bumps than the Y.  This is one of the biggest complaints on 3/Ys and I think the comfort outweighs the loss in responsiveness. Minimum turning radius is much tighter than the Y.

At max strength, regenerative braking is stronger than on the Leaf and weaker than on a Tesla. So the stopping distance and comfort when using only regen to brake is nice middle ground.",9889,True,1657050423.0,2022-07-05 21:47:03,25,69,EuthanizeArty,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/vs6eou/short_term_review_of_ioniq_5_se_rwd_and/,True,0.76,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Shares of Twitter fell 6% in extended trading.

 WILMINGTON, Del, July 8 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc **(TWTR.N)** has a strong legal case against Elon Musk walking away from his $44 billion deal to acquire the U.S. social media company but could opt for a renegotiation or settlement instead of a long court fight, according to legal experts.

Delaware courts, where the dispute between the two sides is set to be litigated, have set a high bar for acquirers being allowed to abandon their deals.

post,vyt06k,,Twitter Says It Can Beat Musk’s Claims in Four Trial Days,"(Bloomberg) -- Twitter Inc. wants a lightning-quick trial to resolve its claim that billionaire Elon Musk wrongfully canceled his proposed $44 billion buyout of the social-media platform.

Lawyers for the San Francisco-based company say they need only four days in Delaware Chancery Court to prove that the world’s richest man should be forced to honor his agreement and pay $54.20 a share for Twitter. The company hopes to start the non-jury case on Sept. 19. Legal experts, however, predict the case will take about two weeks to try.

Unlike some states where it can take several years to get a case to trial, Delaware Chancery Court generally moves quicker. Chancery judges -- business law experts -- are known for being able to parse through the legal thickets of complex merger and acquisition disputes more quickly and thoroughly than other US courts. Even complex business cases are often argued before a judge within six or seven months of being filed.

The Twitter buyout agreement specifies all legal disputes over the deal must be heard in Delaware, corporate home to more than half of U.S. public companies, including Twitter and Musk’s Tesla Inc..

Musk and his lawyers didn’t immediately return emails Tuesday seeking comment on both the suit and whether the case can be tried on Twitter’s schedule. Musk did issue a tweet Tuesday, saying: “Oh the irony lol.”

A judge hasn’t yet been assigned to the case, but Chief Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick already has taken on investor suits over the teetering transaction. She may pick up Twitter’s suit as well. McCormick, a Delaware native, is a former legal-aid lawyer and graduate of Notre Dame Law School.

Twitter’s legal team argues it can easily show in less than a week of court time that Musk didn’t have legitimate grounds to nix the $54.20-per-share buyout. Twitter shares rose 8.1% to $36.83 at 3:01 p.m. Wednesday.",3115,True,1657795973.0,2022-07-14 12:52:53,1836,336,polloponzi,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/vyt06k/twitter_says_it_can_beat_musks_claims_in_four/,True,0.94,2022,both,search,False,True,0,

(Financial Times) -- Elon Musk says he needs more time to prepare for courtroom showdown over his attempt to back out of $44bn deal

Elon Musk has accused Twitter of an “unjustifiable request to rush” the trial to determine whether he should be forced to complete a $44bn deal to buy the social media company.

Musk has suggested a trial start in February at the earliest, according to a court filing from his lawyers on Friday. That is several months later than the September timing being pushed for by Twitter in its lawsuit, which was filed in Delaware chancery court just days after Musk announced his intention to terminate the deal.

Lawyers representing the Tesla chief executive on Friday said in the 16-page response to Twitter’s lawsuit that the question of spam accounts on the network — one of the primary reasons Musk has given for attempting to back out of the deal — was “fundamental” to the case and required lengthier investigation and “substantial time for discovery”.

Musk’s lawyers described the proposed trial date, and the suggestion by Twitter it could be completed in four days, as being on a “breakneck schedule”.

“Twitter’s sudden request for warp speed after two months of foot-dragging and obfuscation is its latest tactic to shroud the truth about spam accounts long enough to railroad defendants into closing,” the filing read.

A hearing on the matter is due to be held on Tuesday. Twitter declined to comment.

The social media company’s lawsuit accused Musk, the world’s richest man, of trying to back out of the deal on account of the rout in tech stocks that has hurt the value of Twitter and many of its peers. On July 8, when Musk announced his intention to back out of the deal worth $54.20 per share, the stock had fallen to $36.81.",3812,True,1657972489.0,2022-07-16 13:54:49,1527,444,polloponzi,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/w0eydc/musk_asks_court_to_reject_twitters_request_for/,True,0.95,2022,both,search,False,True,0,

Unfortunately for him, [Bret Taylor](https://twitter.com/btaylor/status/1546965769983889409) and Twitter's lawyers have an airtight contract which Musk (typically)  signed back in April without much thought.

Highlights:

* *""On  April 25, 2022, Musk\[\] agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in  cash, for a total of about $44 billion. That price, presented by Musk on  a take-it-or-leave-it basis in an unsolicited public offer, represented  a 38% premium over Twitter’s unaffected share price. The other terms  Musk offered and agreed to were, as he touted, “seller friendly.” There  is no financing contingency and no diligence condition. The deal is  backed by airtight debt and equity commitments. Musk has personally  committed $33.5 billion.""* (Sections 3, 4) In other words, he threw  money at Twitter, and was so confident of winning that he signed the  deal without doing any due diligence and basically guaranteeing the  financing himself.
* *""Musk’s  exit strategy is a model of hypocrisy. One of the chief reasons Musk  cited\[\] for wanting to buy Twitter was to rid it of the “\[c\]rypto spam”  he viewed as a “major blight on the user experience.” But when the  market declined and the fixed-price deal became less attractive, Musk  shifted his narrative, suddenly demanding “verification” that spam was  not a serious problem on Twitter’s platform, and claiming a burning need  to conduct “diligence” he had expressly forsworn.""* (Section 7) Due diligence is a process you do before entering into a contract not after.

post,w2yhd9,,Tesla vs WeWork,"Just finished watching the Hulu WeWork documentary, and throughout the entire film, all I could think was ""How is Tesla not just like WeWork??"" The parallels between the two are a lot in my opinion. 

Summarizing real quick and briefly the WeWork documentary:

- Adam shows up in 2010 after the financial crisis. This was a time when people were being a bit greedy, betting on Tech companies a lot of money in hopes of incredible returns or finding that next ""unicorn"". 
- Adam uses his charisma to ensnare people into working for him and investing in his dream, a ""revolution in the workplace"" that would ""forever change the human interaction"" when it comes to business and maybe even societal expectations about work / life balance. Telling people that everyone is a ""creator"" and all this other spiritual stuff. 
- WeWork had a fairly straightforward business model. The company would sign long-term leases on office space (from Adam after he purchased the buildings himself) subdivide it into smaller work areas, and then rent those out to freelancers or small businesses on a short-term basis. 
- The innovation here was the different way of presenting work space to people - changing the overall aesthetic. That is it!! 
- WeWork uses all types of tactics (gets attractive young people, booze, free snacks in offices, the inspirational mantras, etc...) to entice people to work for them or open their offices in WeWork locations, or invest in the company. Adam essentially creates a cult of personality around him, being all about “bringing people together” in the “spirit of We."" He cashed in the fact that many people are looking for ""purpose"" in life. 
- Adam Neumann insisted that WeWork was going to be huge, and it had something to do with technology. “So we’re definitely not a real-estate company,” he said to a skeptical television interviewer. “We are a community of creators” who “leverage technology to connect people. . . . And it’s a new way of working.",4811,True,1658252127.0,2022-07-19 19:35:27,0,51,SilentBob890,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w2yhd9/tesla_vs_wework/,True,0.47,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

post,w56glz,,Tesla Earnings - some perspective,"Tesla rallied 10% yeterday, post earnings. A move we have not seen in a while. Tesla long held the mantle of poster boy in the US 2020/21 tech rally, fanned my the biggest monetary expansion in history. Does its rally herald a comeback in tech, or is it one last dead cat bounce for the most over-hyped and over-priced stock in history?

To be fair to Tesla, there was some mis-reporting of Free Cash Flows being negative without its BitCoin sales. Not true (FCF = Operating Cash Flows - Cap-Ex), so the $621 million free cash flow was true, the BTC sale an investment cash flow. That said, the $0.8 billion reported net change in cash would have been negative without the BTC sale - which of course saw some loss of credibility to Musk given previous comments on the subject.

Perhaps a better understanding of the motivation for that decision on cash by its CEO and CFO can be helped by seeing the fall in free cash flows:

3Q21: $1,328M, 4Q21: $2,775M, 1Q22: $2,228, 2Q22: $621 

On a quarterly and trailing 12 month basis, Tesla announced:

**Revenues of $16.93 billion ($67.166 billion, 12 month ttv)**

**Net (GAAP) profits of $2.259 billion ($9.516 billion, 12 month ttv)**

**Free Cash Flow of $621 million ($6.952 billion, 12 month ttv)**

Tesla trades then at:

**13 x Price to sales;**

**89 x Price to earnings;**

**122 x Price to FCF**

Heady numbers, but Tesla is of course a growth stock and all about its future earnings potential in EV cars, semis, pick-ups, robo-taxis, business to business/customer tech sales, battery sales and artificial intelligence. Lets take a look at those areas vs its competitors...

China and Europe's large automobile markets (26 and 12 million sales in 2021) now have 1 in 5 cars sold as plug-ins (BEV/PHEV's) unlike the US mkt still showing only 1 in 20 EV sales from the 15 million vehicles sold in 2021.

 July 22 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc [**(TWTR.N)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/TWTR.N) on Friday blamed its ongoing battle to close its $44-billion acquisition by Elon Musk and a weakening digital advertising market for a surprise fall in quarterly revenue and a net loss.

post,wayz3g,,The Fed vowed to crush inflation with higher rates. Then the stock market rallied. Here’s why. (It’s not good news)- Interesting read," The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by another 75 basis points despite acknowledging that economic growth is clearly slowing. The central bank, under Powell, reiterated that the path of least resistance is well-represented by the so-called dot plot: More hikes ahead — all the way to a fed funds rate of 3.75%!

And yet, the stock market has staged a humongous rally, led by the most valuation-sensitive and risk-sentiment-driven asset classes: Nasdaq stocks **COMP,** **+1.08%** and crypto.

**So … what the heck?!**

It all boils down to how one single sentence was able to affect the probability distributions that investors were projecting for different asset classes.  
Does it sound complicated? Bear with me: it’s not!

**Why did stocks rally?**

When the FOMC’s press release was published, it looked like business as usual: A well-telegraphed 75-bp hike with the only small surprise represented by an unanimous vote despite clear acknowledgment that economic growth is softening.

But not even 15 minutes into the press conference, the fireworks went off!  
In particular, when Powell said: ‘‘We are now at levels broadly in line with our estimates of neutral interest rates, and after front-loading our hiking cycle until now we will be much more data-dependent going forward.’’

 **This is very important for several reasons-**

The neutral rate is the prevailing rate at which the economy delivers its potential GDP growth rate — without overheating or excessively cooling down. With this 75-bp hike, Powell told us the Fed just reached its estimate of a neutral rate and, hence, from here they aren’t contributing to economic overheating anymore. But that also means any further increases are going to put the Fed in an actively restrictive territory. And the bond market knows that every time the Fed became restrictive in the past, they ended up breaking something.",4424,True,1659082069.0,2022-07-29 10:07:49,435,164,Johnblr,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/wayz3g/the_fed_vowed_to_crush_inflation_with_higher/,True,0.9,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,wuwujv,,Chevy Bolt - Good Dealer Experince,"There are so many negative posts about dealers that I thought yoiu might enjoy hearing a good story. 

 I have a 2021 Tesla MY and my wife was driving a 2018 CR-V with 40,000 miles on it. We started wondering about the resale value and going all electric. On July 10, we checked the CR-V value at [webuyanycar.com](http://webuyanycar.com/) and seeing a $27,000 valuation (we paid $33,500 new), decided it was time. Given good press for the Bolt, the price reduction, and our need for a car for errands and short trips, we decided to start there. We do frequently road trip from Philadelphia to Daytona, but we always use the Tesla for that anyway (autopilot is a gamechanger on long trips). 

We visited Armen Chevrolet in Ardmore, PA, close to our house. They didn't have any Bolt's to test drive (we were not surprised) but they did have a 2022 at their service location and we were able to get in and play with the infotainment system. That car was awaiting the battery replacement so they would not let us go anywhere. The deal they offered was straight forward. Price is MRSP. Put down a $500 refundable deposit and he will call when they ""get an allocation.""  We spent just a few minutes on the configuration: Red, LT-2 adding adaptive cruise, L2 charger, and floor mats for a total of $30,885, including $995 destination charge. The salesperson was very nice, not at all ""salesy"", and he said we're looking at October/November. 

Later that day we went to Pizzaro Nissan nearby.  The Nissan dealer was playing games with the Leaf with a $12,000 non-optional ""value package."" They had no Leaf of any trim to even look at. He also did call back when I called with a question. 

We then went to CarMax and sold the CR-V (we don't need two cars for the next few months) for $28,000! Still makes us wonder what we're missing. 

On 7/18, we called Armen and gave him our credit card. We checked back on on 8/18 and the salesperson told us we're #3 and ""October-ish is still good.",2185,True,1661182610.0,2022-08-22 17:36:50,52,24,105BigDave,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/wuwujv/chevy_bolt_good_dealer_experince/,True,0.92,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

 Aug 23 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc [**(TWTR.N)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/TWTR.N) misled federal regulators about its defenses against hackers and spam accounts, the social media company's former security chief Peiter Zatko said in a whistleblower complaint.

In an 84-page complaint, Zatko, a famed hacker more widely known as ""Mudge,"" alleged Twitter falsely claimed it had a solid security plan, according to documents relayed by congressional investigators.

post,wx7vp2,,"Issues and service experience with Tesla M3 after 10,000 km"," 

1. The front suspension is as noisy on uneven roads as a car with over 100,000 km. Tesla service says that they've changed the necessary parts, but the sound is still there.
2. There was a rattling noise from both seatbelt adjustment knobs on the b-pillars. Again, parts are changed, but the issue is still there.
3. The seatbelt alarm goes off in the back seats, even with empty child seats. This is a recent issue; I didn't have a problem with the same seats initially. Tesla service said they had tested it and didn't see a problem. When I drove off from the service, I noticed that the seatbelt was buckled in by someone, so no wonder they didn't notice the problem.
4. If it's hot outside (above 30-35 deg. C), the memory function of the mirrors and car seats is entirely different from the saved settings and needs readjustment. The service couldn't test this as it's not as hot outside anymore.
5. I've lost the cellular reception entirely for a couple of hours a day (again, when it was hot outside). That's a real pain on a long road trip where you expect the route planner to find you the next supercharger. The service couldn't verify this.
6. Once during a supercharging session in the middle of nowhere, I went to the toilet, and when I returned, the phone key didn't work. Restarting the app didn't help. The only solution I found was the remote start from the app. Scary; don't forget your key cards.
7. There was an annoying rattling sound from the back seats as one of the covers was loose. The service guys fixed it, but now a new vibration appears whenever I accelerate.
8. The middle of the touchscreen makes a clicking noise if I touch it. It's a known issue; no fix is available yet.
9. When I used Autopilot, the car braked suddenly at least once every 100 km on a 2,800 km (only highway) road trip. In many cases, it wanted to slow down to a speed limit which did not (no longer?) exist.",3125,True,1661413399.0,2022-08-25 09:43:19,22,13,gbodis,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/wx7vp2/issues_and_service_experience_with_tesla_m3_after/,True,0.72,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Mr. Zatko alleges that:

* Twitter is in material noncompliance with both its obligations under a 2011 FTC consent decree and its general obligations under data privacy, unfair trade practice, and consumer protection laws and regulations;
* Twitter is uniquely vulnerable to systemic disruption resulting from data center failures or malicious actors, a fact which Twitter leadership (including its CEO) have ignored and sought to obfuscate;
* Twitter’s platform is built in significant part on the misappropriation and infringement of third party intellectual property; and
* Twitter acquiesced to demands made by the Indian government that its agents be hired by Twitter and given access to Twitter user information.

Basically, Elon's lawyers are contending that even if the court rejects his prior termination this NEW termination provides more than enough reason to terminate:

These allegations, if true, demonstrate that Twitter has breached the following provisions of the Merger Agreement, thereby giving the Musk Parties the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms as more fully described below.

1. **Section 4.5 Permits; Compliance With Laws**\*\*.\*\* In the Merger Agreement, Twitter represented, *inter alia*, that it was in compliance with all applicable laws.",11484,True,1661874124.0,2022-08-30 17:42:04,88,51,ReviewEquivalent1266,elonmusk,https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/x1mcxv/can_twtr_survive_elon_musks_latest_attack_exhibit/,True,0.83,2022,elon,search,False,False,0,
post,x2vrgs,,Did Elon Hook up with T-Mobile Just So FSD 10.69 Will Continue to Work?," 

Without map data/connectivity, FSD does not seem to work so well.  (I had a compilation video link showing beta tester's experiences, but the post got taken down - see below.)  Anyway, FSD was not working nearly as well without connection as it does with.

From Tesla:

""Added a new “deep lane guidance” module to the Vector Lanes neural network which fuses features extracted from the video streams with coarse map data, i.e. lane counts and lane connectivities. This architecture achieves a 44% lower error rate on lane topology compared to the previous model, enabling smoother control before lanes and their connectivities becomes visually apparent. This provides a way to make every Autopilot drive as good as someone driving their own commute, yet in a sufficiently general way that adapts for road changes.""

I'm thinking Elon is creating this Starlink feature just to ensure that FSD continues to work well after 10.69.

Also, I posted a link to my YouTube video showing how much worse FSD 10.69 works without data connectivity, but it got taken down.

post,x7wd83,,Do you think Teslas as a status symbol is on its way out?,"Before it sounds like im taking a dig, I would like to point out Im from arguably the biggest car culture city in America, most people drive around looking straight out of fast and furious which includes the Teslas. 



A year ago a Tesla was considered a car of class, wealth, and nobility. This is due to it being the only nice electric car. Today we have upcoming electric Lamborghinis, Dodge Chargers and Challengers, Cameros, a real Mustang, and many more sport cars on the way. As Teslas slowly become the Toyota Camry of Electric cars do you think the excitement of owning/seeing a Tesla will fade into nothing but the same reaction of seeing any other “normal” car? 


In our household I have a Dodge Challenger and a Tahoe while my fiancé has a mini Cooper and a Tesla model 3. The model 3 initially caught a lot of heads and got looks but now not so much. She plans to trade both in for the upcoming electric Mini Cooper. I had planned to trade the Tahoe in on a Model Y however with the announcement of an electric Charger Daytona, that is now my next car purchase instead. 




I work in tech so, many colleagues of mine have teslas and we’ve discussed this at length, many plan to trade their teslas in on upcoming electric sport cars. So in my small subject pool it seems to be out the door. 


Would you say this is slowly going to become the norm or is it just an isolated culture shift due to our big local car culture? I’ve followed automobiles since elementary school and have seen many shifts in trends and this seems to me a logical step in the plan of Elon Musk to make Teslas the default electric car anyone can have.",1640,False,1662527427.0,2022-09-07 07:10:27,0,23,americanista915,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/x7wd83/do_you_think_teslas_as_a_status_symbol_is_on_its/,True,0.33,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

post,xvg2gw,,Battery drain in Tesla vs Etron - any tips?,"So my 2022 Etron is currently in the shop and I’ve been using a rental 2022 Model Y LR for the past few weeks (which was the car I’d been considering instead, so it’s been fun to do a side by side comparison).

The Model Y has a bunch of fun tech (sentry mode, voice control, it’s super quick, etc) - but I’ve noticed a couple of things that were surprising:

1. Autopilot isn’t any better than lane keeping assist in my Etron.  (The car technically has FSD, but that doesn’t seem to be active - presume Hertz isn’t in the beta?).  The rental Kia’s I’ve had on vacation are better - so I’m curious where the Tesla hype is coming from (perhaps this car has cameras not radar)

2. Vampire drain in the Tesla is real and bad.  I can leave my Etron parked for ~weeks, and I won’t lose a single mile of range (which is good, because the range is admittedly pretty bad vs the Y).  The Tesla, on the other hand, dumps range while sitting in my driveway.

I *think* this is due to sentry mode - does anyone else experience this?

I ran a test on the Tesla and the sentry mode drain.
Last Thursday I charged it up to 90%.  Unplugged, drove it to the covered airport parking lot at SJC, and had ~85% battery remaining.  Turned off climate control, turned off cabin temperature protection but left on sentry mode.
Flew out for a few days, came back yesterday.  
Sentry mode picked up 3 things.
Battery had dropped to 56%.
So 29% drop in 4 days while stationary and “off” with sentry enabled.

According to Chibuike Oguh from Reuters, Apollo Global Management,  Inc. (APO) is backing out of Twitter, Inc. (TWTR) buyout financing for  Elon Musk. According to a person familiar with the matter, Apollo Global  Management, which was looking to provide $1 billion earlier this year  to Elon Musk for the deal, is no longer in talks with the billionaire.

Twitter shares rose more than 22% yesterday after Bloomberg reported  that Musk is proposing to acquire the company for the original offer  price of $54.20 per share.

Later, it was confirmed that Musk has sent Twitter a letter,  according to which he intends to proceed to close the Twitter  transaction on the original terms. For the last several months, Musk  tried to pull out of the buyout deal due to ongoing disagreement over  the number of spam and bot accounts on the site, prompting a lawsuit  regarding the takeover.

According to Reuters, Musk's changed decision over the deal made  Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) investors fear that the billionaire, who sold over $15 billion worth of Tesla shares earlier in the year to fund the deal,  was spreading himself too thin.

According to Dan Ives from Wedbush, Musk’s interest in closing the  deal would weigh on Tesla’s shares. ""We see lingering impacts from Musk  stock sales as a drag dissipating but the big worry is Musk juggling too  many balls at the same time,"" Ives said.

post,xx6a8l,,Eight ways Elon Musk could still get out of buying Twitter,"([Via FinancialTimes](https://www.ft.com/content/3ca480f5-3077-4d7b-83d3-21d4d68bfd7c))

Let’s start with the obvious. [Elon Musk’s written proposal](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922105787/tm2227435d1_sc13da.htm)  to Twitter promises to close the $44bn deal “pending receipt of the  proceeds of the debt financing”. The wording sounds a bit sus given  recent history, but can it really offer an escape route?

**Option 1. The banks pull out**

Musk  is on the hook for $33.5bn of financing for the Twitter purchase. An  additional $13bn of funding will be underwritten by a Morgan Stanley-led  syndicate of seven banks. The banks, having capped the maximum rate on  the unsecured LBO debt at 11.75 per cent, will be [taking a bath](https://www.ft.com/content/ef12b153-7304-49ac-b735-0584204918fa) when they try to sell it on. 

Their options to bail can be found in [Exhibit E](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922049844/tm2213189d8_ex99-h.htm),  towards the bottom of the commitment letter posted in April. Probably  the only available option at this point would be to claim a material  adverse event at Twitter, perhaps by taking up Musk’s now-abandoned  argument that it’s a great big fraud made of bots. 

This has some advantages for Musk. Having the banks lead the attack might reduce the risk of having his [cringy texts](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/09/elon-musk-texts-twitter-trial-jack-dorsey/671619/) read to the court. 

Even so, [as many commentators have pointed out](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-09-07/does-elon-musk-know-how-mergers-work),  the bots thing is transparent nonsense. And it's doubtful that the  biggest business problem for Twitter — its purchaser’s fickleness about  whether he actually wants to buy it — is a watertight reason for the  banks to pull financing.

Likelihood: **2/5**

**Option 2. Musk sabotages his agreement with the banks**

* Collateralized loan obligation prices have been hit hard by a slump in the British pound and the unwinding of U.K. pension investments
* Weakness in the CLO market may also have a knock-on effect on leveraged buyouts, including the financing for Elon Musk’s planned purchase of Twitter.

Fallout from the crisis in U.K. financial markets has hit a faraway corner of Wall Street: the trillion-dollar market for collateralized loan obligations.

Once a niche product, [CLOs are now widely held](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hunt-for-yield-fuels-boom-in-clos-1508673601?mod=article_inline) by investors around the world, including the British pensions, insurers and funds that got caught by [the recent crash in U.K. currency](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-england-to-buy-bonds-to-stop-crisis-spread-11664360313?mod=article_inline) and government-bond markets. Many of them sold CLO bonds to meet margin calls, sending prices of the securities tumbling well below their intrinsic value, analysts and fund managers said.

Some U.S. investment funds rushed to snap up the bonds at what they considered incredible bargains.

“It was the heaviest selling pressure we’ve ever seen,” said Tom Majewski, a managing partner at Eagle Point Credit Management, a Greenwich, Conn.-based investment firm specializing in CLOs. Eagle Point purchased about $80 million of CLO securities in the seven trading days ended Oct. 5, double the amount it would normally buy in a seven-day period, he said.

In recent weeks, trading of the CLO bonds most commonly held by pensions and insurers hit its highest level since March and April of 2020, according to analysis by The Wall Street Journal of trading data reported to a U.S. regulator.",7872,True,1665485169.0,2022-10-11 12:46:09,732,113,polloponzi,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/y15u4m/uk_crisis_spills_into_us_junk_debt/,True,0.91,2022,elon,search,False,False,0,

\- Bring back radar, Vision SUCKS. Way more phantom braking events, and autopilot slows down in foggy conditions when with radar it did not. Also, radar would show cars in front of me 2 or 3 deep, now with vision, all I see is the one in front on my visualization screen. Although, vision seems to do a better job at lane-keeping. So, a hybrid radar/vision might be best. It’s so bad that I rarely use autopilot anymore because when I do, I’m always on edge, ready to unintentionally brake check someone at a moment’s notice. You know a function is badly designed when the user is incentivized to NOT use that function. One of the biggest reasons I and probably most people bought Tesla was because of autopilot, and now it’s degraded to the point of not using it. 

\- Implement a dumb cruise control that only keeps the speed constant like every other car. I don't want phantom braking and making people angry behind me who think I brake checked them, I don't want to slow down in foggy conditions or around curves, I don't want lane keeping, I don't want distance keeping, I don't want 85 MPH to be my top limit. I just want the speed kept constant as if I had my foot on the accelerator and nothing else. 

\- Allow switching of accelerations speeds by tapping the ""chill"" word, just like tapping the battery changes it from % to miles. Or have different driving profiles available at the tap of a button, like the M buttons on BMW M cars. I don’t want to change my entire Driver profile to do this.

post,y2h9ij,,Tesla Vision is a major regression on Model Y,"I realize this has been talked about a bit, but just wanted to share my experiences. I have an early 2020 Model Y with enhanced autopilot. I drive quite a bit for work and have put over 72k miles on my Model Y. I have autopilot engaged probably over 90% of the time because most of my driving is on the interstate. A few weeks ago I got the Tesla Vision update. Tesla Vision has provided no discernible advantage and has a lot of issues compared to the radar based system:

* Further follow distance. I am not sure why they haven't just renamed 2 to 1. It seems weird that it's not possible to set the follow distance to 1 under any conditions. 
* Speed limited to 85 mph. This is the one thing that doesn't really affect me as over 85 mph is considered reckless driving in my state.
* Automatic wipers required. My windshield was a bit dirty on the hour long drive home on a clear day yesterday, and the wipers refused to turn off. Tried cleaning with the washer fluid without success.
* Automatic high beams required. The automatic high beams work horribly while driving on the interstate. They are tripped up by the simplest things like highway signs. I am basically constantly flashing my high beams unless I am in heavy traffic (in which case they stay off). I am legitimately concerned the police are going to pull me over for this.
* Autopilot can no longer reliably see two cars ahead. This was actually a fairly useful feature. For instance, if there was a large car in front of me driving slow in the left lane, it would help me determine whether it was just that one car (so I could easily undertake) or multiple cars.
* Autopilot and cruise control can no longer be used in fog. This is the most egregious limitation. My commute to work is through the Blue Ridge mountains. Fog is frequent. There was one week where I didn't make it to work a single day without autopilot disengaging due to fog.

I always knew I’d eventually get back to driving a long range BEV EV sometime soon after parting ways with my Tesla Model S 75D about 3 years ago. I’ve been following the EV market ever since and when I knew the time had come to go back to a long range EV, I was *tremendously* excited. A lot has changed in the six years since I was in the market for an EV. At that time the Model 3 wasn’t even out yet and an inventory Model S 75D was the best option for me.

I’ve seen so many great looking EVs in my price range come to market since then and I was excited to dive into learning about all of them and going on lots of test drives.

post,y4agt8,,Auto high beams make Autopilot unusable at night,"The recent mandatory high beams with autopilot is basically the biggest step backward I’ve seen in my 6 years of owning teslas. The biggest issue is implementation and complete lack of predictability. 

It’s not possible to know at night if engaging Autopilot will cause the high beams to activate. Just last night I tried to activate Autopilot and the high beams came on making the car 3 lengths ahead of me think I was telling them to speed up so they brake checked me. 

Here are the issues. 

1. High beams turn on with every activation of autopilot.
2. There is no delay to give you the chance to turn them off. If the car thinks they should be on, the millisecond AP engages they come on.
3. The algorithm for the auto high beams is pathetically poor. They come on with cars in front of you, they come on with traffic coming the other way, they come on while traveling on well lit urban streets. 

All of this combines to make it so much of a hassle and annoyance to use Autopilot at night that it’s essentially not useable anymore. 

I get Tesla is covering their ass while they struggle to get the vision only AP system working but this is absolutely not the way to go about it. 

I would like to see at least one of the following. 

1. A timer that gives you 3 seconds to turn the high beams off after engaging AP

Here’s the video: https://imgur.com/a/BiIy93H

Here are the facts: 
* I engage autopilot on a dark road. I don’t want the brights on and see an ephemeral menu with headlight options at a glance, so I hit “off,” assuming that these are controls for auto brights. It’s now pitch black and I can’t see where I’m going. This is my mistake, but drivers make mistakes and car interfaces should be forgiving.
* The intuitive action in this scenario is for me to reverse the physical action that I’ve taken and turn them back on the menu is gone now, and I’m in a scenario where I’m driving blind and trying to open a menu, scan the busy screen, and get the lights back on.
* I’m essentially forced to pull over and figure it out.
* You have a hint for what I fall back on and what requires the least thinking because I initially turn my blinker on, then the hazard lights, for some amount of light to see where I’m going. Both of these are physical controls.

Apologists will come up with 10,000 ways to blame me or say that “you should have/could have just done x,” but the point is that scenarios like this are unexpected and it should be intuitive to reverse them. I’m also not certain why the car allows headlights to be turned off at night, in drive, and at speed.

I’m a professional UX Designer and will clearly say that how Tesla has headlight control implemented has severe usability issues. I can get along with things like climate being behind menus, but not something as safety-critical as headlights.

They obviously can’t go around adding physical controls, but a band-aid could be something like only allowing headlight changes in park, or requiring confirmation of turning off the lights when it’s dark outside.

Also, yes, I know that brights do have a physical control.",2037,True,1665835726.0,2022-10-15 14:08:46,0,49,maowai,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/y4mawl/watch_me_struggle_to_turn_the_headlights_back_on/,True,0.44,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,y78460,,Basic Autopilot problems getting worse and worse by the update. Stop-and-go traffic basically unusable.,"I’ve had my ’22 M3 RWD coming up on a year. It of course was always fully Vision Only with no radar. Over the past year, I had to wait for updates to get up to similar specs as the radar enabled cars: following distance, finally 85MPH, etc. Overall in the beginning, I didn’t have too many complaints with Autopilot. I didn’t have the phantom braking that many did. The only complaint I had early on was Autopilot drove too aggressively in stop-and-go traffic. Mainly it would fully accelerate up if the car in front just barely moved. It was so embarrassing I would never use it with guests in the car. I was able to work around that for the most part by lowering autopilot speed and changing to chill mode in those moments. Not ideal but it somewhat worked. I would do every software update in hopes it would fix it, like a lot of do. Fast forward to today. I down right refuse to use Autopilot in traffic because of how dangerous it is. It drives like a teenager learning to drive. It still does that full acceleration thing but now it slams on the brakes as soon as a car in front stops in stop-and-go traffic. And when I say the car in front stops, I don’t mean they slammed on their brakes, they were driving like a normal good driver would. I’ve had two different times where the brake check my cars does causes the person behind me to almost hit me. Needing to swerve off to the side. I’m too fearful to use it for the day when a driver behind me is just a tad distracted and bam, accident.  My old tricks of speed, following distance, chill mode, don’t seem to matter as much. 

Is anyone else dealing with this shit? I keep hearing they are gonna combine the FSD stack and life will be bliss but I’m not holding my breath. Stop-and-go traffic is the true time Autopilot should shine but I’d honestly say that I’ve driven in shittier competitors cars and they do a smoother job of it. Tesla really needs to get their head out of their asses and address things like this.",2342,True,1666102209.0,2022-10-18 16:10:09,844,431,HersheyStains,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/y78460/basic_autopilot_problems_getting_worse_and_worse/,True,0.88,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,y7zjpn,,MS Cleaning inside glass in front of front facing camera,"
Recent posts about stop and go traffic and autopilot deterioration led to a few posts about hazing in front of the front cameras. In no way am I suggesting that cleaning the glass fixes stop-and-go issues, but if you have hazing (like I did), cleaning is moderately easy but does require patience and an awareness of when not to force a screw. I’ve linked a video below that describes this for a Model 3. It’s almost all the same for Model S (can’t speak to new MS, mine is 16/17) except the screws.  See the picture - 6 torx screws hold on the metal camera chassis. Crucial you don’t mess these up. (Edit: I’m second guessing which pair of screws in the top of the image to remove, but it’s obvious when you get in there).  Remove bottom 2 first. 

Instructions: There is a cover over the base of the rear view that comes off by hand. A pry tool is needed to get the next larger plastic housing off but be aware that there are (at least on a 16/17 MS) four small metal clips that are prone to coming loose. Be certain to watch for them, and if they come off just slide them back on. There is also a sort of lip that covers the mirror base to be careful of. With that removed the mirror can come down. The mirror is secured via a triangular sort of cam. Grab the mirror post firmly and twist from the base (no wrench needed as in video). It takes some effort but once it’s off you can remove the last plastic cover and metal chassis that holds the cameras. 6 T10 torx screws hold them on (pictured, double check the last pair). Do NOT force these to the point of rounding out the drive. Do NOT use too small a torx bit either. That’s a quick way to round them out as well. This metal chassis has to be firmly secured to the car or else the cameras will move around and render them mostly useless (I assume).  Carefully remove the 6 screws and the camera chassis will come loose (in the linked video for the M3 there appear to be only 2). No need to disconnect any wires.",2583,True,1666176962.0,2022-10-19 12:56:02,79,9,mshaefer,teslamotors,https://i.redd.it/r9xq8gpvtqu91.jpg,False,0.91,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

I am a Tesla 2021 Dual Motor (with Accel Boost) LR Model Y, and Model 3 RWD SR owner. I also have a Tesla Roof and Powerwall on order.  I am also on the waitlist for a Rivian RS1, and was invited to a Rivian RS1 “First Mile” test drive. The next day, I drove a 2021 Mustang Mach E Premium and 2022 EV6 GT-Line AWD, both lightly used at a local Ford dealer. My buddy Rob, this same week, drove the Mustang Mach E, and Audi q4 E-Tron. Here is our summary:

TL;DR: All have very different personalities, and present credible alternatives to Tesla. The Tesla Supercharging Network and OTA Firmware and Software updates still present differentiating (and disappearing ) advantages that continue to position Tesla as a leader. However, the EV alternatives each have distinguishing characteristics that are done better than Tesla. My next purchases will likely be an RS1 for me, and the Kia EV6 for my wife. Rob has chosen the Audi E-Tron.

**EV6 Summary:**

Those in the know understand the killer product line coming out of Kia. With JD Power quality ratings just behind Lexus and Porsche and a design team built around ex BMW engineers, the Kia offering exudes, quality, composure and character that makes KIA the preferred choice of the Hyundai Group (Hyundai , Kia, Genesis) stable of EV offerings. Heads up display and 800V fast DC charging add to the most composed ride of the test group.

Pros:

800 V DC Fast Charging

Composed and comfortable cabin, chassis, ride; 

Hushed cabin with no road noise

Great front seats

CarPlay and Android Auto Integration

5 YR/50,000 Basic Warranty; 10 YR/100,000 Powertrain and Battery Warranty

Excellent fit and finish

Cons:

Limited rear hatch space; No Front Truck space

I'm paying attention to the road, and do not even have the chance to respond to the warning on screen and there are no blue flashes before the disengagement happens. It just happens suddenly.

At this point, I really do not use FSD at all, so I've turned it off as I do not want to lose future access to the technology for a silly issue with me wearing sunglasses for whatever reason.

I've never had a problem with forced autopilot disengagements (prior to FSD enabled) even while wearing sunglasses, but in the event that this does happen (with FSD now turned OFF) will that somehow still count as a strike against the use of FSD in the future?

post,ybsa9b,,Why didn't it stop!? :( I caused an accident.,"To start off, I take full responsibility for this. I'm not blaming Tesla or anyone for my driving. It was my mistake and I accept my flaws 😅 and still love my Tesla !!!!

Now to explain the situation.

I was getting on a highway from a on-ramp that had a yelid sign. There was a truck in front of me also waiting for a chance to murge onto the highway.

The truck started to proceed forward onto the highway and so I turned around to look if it was clear for me, it was... So I hit the accelerator and drove right into the truck ( that for some reason stopped ).

My question is why wasn't this prevented by my model 3. Autopilot or FSD was not on at the time, but there was no intervention or even a warning about a collision.

I'm a bit torned about this because I feel like the safety features that I always brag about to people let me down and I was wondering if this was just just an inconsistency with the safety features or am I missing something?

It was fun for about a week, but there are some issues that make non-beta full self driving much more preferable.

Automatic windshield wipers forced on (this is really quite terrible as it functions quite poorly)
Automatic high beams (I really hate how it turns on every single time, within city limits and I’m worried about getting a ticket)
Automatic speed adjusting (this functions quite poorly now, barely slowing down as the speed changes, so I do it manually to avoid a ticket. Autopilot was a much more acceptable slow down)

“Moving to fast lane” over and over again… you’re not supposed to be in the “fast lane” in Canada when there’s absolutely no traffic in front of you. The speed based lane changes happen even though it’s disabled. No way to stop it, it just keeps going into the wrong lane any chance it gets.

Stopping at red lights (same as FSD)
It accelerates quickly at green lights compared to regular FSD.
It doesn’t stop at every single flashing or green light like FSD does.

post,ylcm2k,,One Year & 17k Miles Later with Model 3 LR,"I'm just about to hit a year with my Model 3 LR and just wanted to write a quick review for anyone considering purchasing one. 

I'm going to briefly touch on the most common questions I've heard and the experience I had with it. I'll keep it brief. 

First of all, I absolutely love the car, it's easily the most fun car I've ever owned, hands down. I constantly hear, ""It's built like a $20k car!"". Absolute non-sense! Have you driven a $20k car in 2022? I may be lucky but I've had zero issues with the car, other than a camera change, which was free and done at my home, while I was on vacation. Zero complaints!

Having everything on the center screen is great, I know many people complain about no buttons but there is a reason they aren't on our phones any more. Takes a bit to get use to, and by a bit I mean about 30min of driving. My brother drove it when he picked me up from the airport and said ""Very confusing, until you actually drive it, also how do you turn it off!"" Poor soul spent 30min googling trying to figure it out before he called me. 

Autopilot is great but I wouldn't spend a penny on FSD. I like to drive (zoom zoom) so I don't use it often but on long trips, what a god send. I remember a 4hr ride home, very hung over and thanking GOD for AP. It really does a great job staying in the lane and being comfortable. I've had maybe a few phantom breaks but almost all were when I first got it a year ago, total of maybe five light breaks for no reason but it's been nonexistant for a long time. 

Range is great, I absolutely needed the LR Model when I got the car but with a job change I no longer drive as much. I do feel like the range is a bit exaggerated, but not as much as people like to talk about. Currently I have about 97.5% battery capacity, so my max range is about 344 miles, which is still above the S+ and many other cars 100% range.",3642,True,1667504650.0,2022-11-03 20:44:10,225,122,MagnanimousCannabis,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ylcm2k/one_year_17k_miles_later_with_model_3_lr/,True,0.89,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,yoho5r,,"PSA: If your Tesla refuses to activate Autopilot with a ""Cruise Control Unavailable"" error, a door might be ""ajar"".","I just had to suffer through a few days of AP being broken in my 2018 LR RWD Model 3, before I finally decided it wouldn't fix itself and put in a service request. What was happening was that as soon as I tried to enable even just TACC, my car would throw up an error message saying ""Cruise Control Unavailable"" with a link to ""Read more"". The small steering wheel icon that indicates ""Autosteer is available"" would also never come up.

That link in the error message led into the car's built-in Owner's Manual (a pretty nice feature!), which is what gave me the obscure hint I needed to figure out the problem and cancel my service request.

The manual mentions that TACC may refuse to activate for various reasons, including if one of your doors is open. Of course, all of my doors were closed, and nothing was seemingly amiss, as every other system in my car worked fine, and I wasn't getting any other kind of warning about open doors. But on this hunch, I tried opening and closing all four doors and the trunk, and as soon as I got back onto the road, AP was finally available.

So I think what may have happened was that AP got into a state where *it* thought a door was open, but the rest of the car didn't. Probably some sort of minor bug in the AP stack (I don't have FSD beta).

post,yrzodf,,Elon Musk tells Twitter staff he sold Tesla stock to save the social network," 

Twitter's new owner Elon Musk, who is also CEO of electric vehicle maker [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) and U.S. defense contractor SpaceX, told employees of the social media business on Thursday that he recently sold shares of Tesla to ""save Twitter.""

He made the remarks during an all-hands meeting that he hosted in part to motivate Twitter employees who remain after sweeping layoffs to work hard. Musk let go of about half of Twitter employees following his acquisition of the company for $44 billion, or $54.20 per share.

[As CNBC previously reported,](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/) to finance his portion of that take-private deal, last week Musk sold at least another $3.95 billion worth of [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) stock. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission published Tuesday, the batch of shares he just sold amounted to 19.5 million more shares of Tesla.

Earlier this year, he also sold over $8 billion worth of Tesla stock in April and roughly $7 billion worth in August.

Musk has [brought in employees from Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html), including dozens of Autopilot engineers, to help with code review and other work at Twitter along with friends, financial backers and deputies from other companies that he has co-founded.

 

Among other things, [Musk wants Twitter to generate half of its revenue from Twitter Blue subscribers](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/read-elon-musks-first-email-to-all-twitter-employees.html), and to become less reliant on advertising revenue.

post,yssahq,,Keeping things in perspective,"I was reviewing my portfolio, and was feeling pretty down by its performance.  Before I do, I like to keep the returns of the indices in mind. It is the only for me to determine whether my methods are still working or not. Just so you know, I invest only in equities, including gold mining, REITs, and hedging ETFs. I do not invest in bonds, but I will keep some cash on hand in case there is an opportunity too good to pass.  Thank you Elon Musk for the nice little Twitter bonus. I also use covered calls with one year contracts to enhance my income. I only rebalance and reassess the third Friday in January. That keeps me from being totally reactive to market gyrations.

Based on total return, the S&P 500 is down -15.1% this year. The Vanguard Total Bond Fund is down -15.69% this year. If that holds up, it would be an example proving that this is the worst year for bonds since 1793 (yes, you read that right). 

So far this year, I am only down 11%.  I know that is not something to write home about, but I will write it down here, it does give me faith that what I did work.

I do use some literal calculus to determine a fair present value, so I don't overpay on my holdings.

post,yw85ie,,2018 vs 2022 Model X long term family focused comparison,"I had a 2018 X for, well, about 4 years. I've put about 8k miles on the refresh and wanted to share thoughts for anyone thinking about upgrading.

Range - Huge win. I went from 270 to 340 miles, and faster charging. Add it all up and charging stops are about half as long as they used to be on road trips, since you can stay under 60 percent easier. Great!

Interior quality - Good improvement. Nicer materials. Everything is just a touch better. Still a small step down compared to my Genesis GV80, but it's fighting in the right league now.

Speed - Noticeably faster, even without plaid. Teslas are very fun to drive, and the refresh is better. 

Autopilot - Draw to slightly worse. I don't have the phantom braking issues I was expecting, and some parts work better, but there are a lot of small new bugs as well. Stop and go traffic, one of my biggest priorities, is worse as it slams on the brakes when someone 20 feet ahead slows down. I have to wonder if this is because they axed the radar. It ends up being slightly dangerous in city highway traffic jams. 

Controls - Disappointingly a little worse. No stalks, the yoke looks cool but isn't as functional, I'm tired of the button turn signals, I honk when turning on autopilot once a week, etc. These are just unforced errors, and while none are as bad as I feared, they are absolutely a small step back from a normal car.

Audio - Neutral. Was hoping for something a bit better, but no biggie.

Rear seat screen - It exists. Not really sure why it's there, or why there's a powerful GPU. Please give me more range instead. Kids don't really watch it because it's strangely positioned.

Suspension - A bit better. Again, not bad, but not as good as the GV80.

360 surround view - how is this still not a feature?

7 seat vs 6 seat - 3 wide second row is great if you have 3 kids. 3rd row is worse, but if you can use it a lot less, 7 seats is the way to go.

post,yzct79,,Tesla Model Y Postmortem (2 years of ownership),"After two years, I decided to ditch my MY 7 seater. Tesla has agreed to buy it back, and I’ve just finished signing the paper work. It’s been two years, and my heating/ac has never worked for longer than a spell of 2-4 weeks. I’ve had around eight service appointments, at different Tesla service stations to try to resolve it. On at least two of those visits, the climate control service warning came on within 24hrs of picking up the car. It’s bittersweet, as there are things about this car that I truly love, but, ultimately I’ve lost hope that they would ever be able to fix this issue. After two years, I thought it would be nice to put together a postmortem on my Tesla experience.

## The Good
* **Driving Dynamics** - My previous car was an ’08 Nissan Altima, so this was my first time having a sporty car. I really loved how fast it was. The steering wheel is great. It’s a little smaller than the average steering wheel, and combined with the tightness of the wheel, you really feel in control of the car. I hate driving cars that feel like they have a mushy steering wheel, one that you have to over turn to get the car to react. That is definitely not the case here. I’ve heard some complaints that it’s too tight, but I did not find that to be the case.
* **One Pedal Driving** - After using this, I cannot go back. I considered getting a hybrid after giving up on my Tesla, but I just don’t think I can go back to coasting, breaking, and having to putz around with the gas pedal. One pedal driving is an amazing experience, and Tesla nails it. 
* **Cargo Space** - This car had enough space, and seating that we didn’t need to cart our minivan on long road trips and vacations. The last road trip we did involved five people, a 40lb dog, the dog’s crate, and four pieces of luggage. Everything fit, and really with room to spare.  
* **20” induction tires** - These are beautiful. Probably the nicest looking thing on this car.",7375,True,1668867255.0,2022-11-19 15:14:15,842,517,LvstForLife,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/yzct79/tesla_model_y_postmortem_2_years_of_ownership/,True,0.89,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

&#x200B;

After almost five years (Jan 2018, serial number under 5000), I sold my 2018 Model 3 LR RWD last weekend.   I was a Musk/Tesla cheerleader when I got it and I have become… something else… in the meantime. I'll attempt to keep this on the topic of my actual vehicle experience for the most part.

&#x200B;

# The Good

* **Performance** \- It's zippy in a straight line until you get to extralegal speeds, and stays reasonably well composed in the corners when driving aggressively.
* **One pedal driving** \- Like the other guy, I REALLY liked this.  I will miss it and am not looking forward to having to use my brake pedal more.
* **Mobile app** \- Worked well for the most part (exceptions to be mentioned elsewhere).
* **Autopilot (Just Autosteer, TACC, and driver-initiated automatic lane changes. The rest to be discussed elsewhere)**\- This was the reason I bought the car and for the first couple of years, it steadily improved.   I still have no regrets buying the car + autopilot (basic autopilot wasn't included back then, it cost me an extra $5k).
* **Sound system** \- I'm no audiophile but pretty good to me.
* **Nav/charging integration** \- This made switching to an EV pretty simple, the car would generally figure out where I'd need to stop and charge, and it got better at it over time.
* **Overall reliability** \- Not the best I've had on a new car, but far from the worst.   Never left me stranded, never had a major feature stop working.
* **Frunk -** What a great, great place to keep things you need to have with you, but don't need to access every day.
* **TPMS -** It's difficult to express how pleased I was and am with how good the implementation of that is.",7691,True,1668911597.0,2022-11-20 03:33:17,515,358,run-the-joules,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/yzsyar/tesla_model_3_postmortem_5_years_of_ownership/,True,0.9,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

post,z4tty2,,Model Y Performance ownership wrapup (2 years),"I recently traded in my MYP after two years and roughly 24,000 miles and wanted to share my ownership thoughts and some of the highlights and lowlights of the car.  This assessment is coming from a long-time car enthusiast and not an EV evangelist or EV hater.

I’ve done my best to leave out commentary on the community and the management of the company–while both of those factored into my personal decision to get rid of the car I wanted to focus on the merits of the car itself.

Tl;dr:  EVs do performance, packaging, and livability really well.  And they are going to be the future.  But my next EV is going to be from somebody other than Tesla.

***The good***:

* **Storage and interior space**:  
   * Between the massive under-trunk bin, the funk, and the flat rear passenger floor there is just an obscene amount of space for cargo.  I don’t think anything else can touch the MY for the sheer amount of discrete storage spaces.  Interior passenger space is also very open and roomy.
* **Acceleration**:  
   * Far quicker than any car its size has a right to be and the #1 reason I bought the car in the first place.  Power is accessible instantaneously and without drama–no launch control cheating, just stomp the long pedal and go. 
   * It’s the first car I’ve owned where I didn’t get used to/bored with the acceleration over time–it’s quick enough off the line that it just hits at a visceral level.  While acceleration falls off quickly over 60-70mph, there is more than enough for effortless passing at highway speeds.
* **One-pedal driving**:  
   * Love it.  In my daily commuting I would almost never touch the brake pedal.  The OPD is super dialed-in and very easy to modulate.  And it was downright fun to get the “perfect stop” where you rely only on regen and stop the car right on the mark.
* **Running costs**:  
   * While it liked burning through expensive tires, in two years the only consumables I had to buy were tires, windshield washer fluid, and cabin filters.",8565,True,1669424746.0,2022-11-26 02:05:46,623,170,AlrightAlbatross,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/z4tty2/model_y_performance_ownership_wrapup_2_years/,True,0.91,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

I wish this weren't the case, but I think some of the risks are real.

Some owners/buyers may not care, other owners may reduce their word of mouth advertising, other owners may choose to not buy again, and others may try to switch immediately. We've already seen some posts like this in here over the past year. I think a significant factor will be how much an owner sees a Tesla vehicle as part of their identity/personal brand vs their owning it because of the technical merits/strengths.

post,zg7c4g,,The bottom is in. Just keep dcaing into indexes and in 20 years you'll have a lot more money.. Easy,"The bottom is always in when your outlook is 20 years from now my friends!

The best way to make money long term is to keep buying in small amounts each week into and index.

Ignore Cnbc! They're in business to keep people watching. Yes, you can learn some things and get a general market sense, etc,but take everything you hear with a grain of salt!

Remember that the people they have on are usually trying to pump their own stocks or get you to go along with their investing thesis,not to help YOU, but to make money for themselves. That's just my opinion.

Anyways I have about 20 good companies that I average down in but I'm slowly coming around to the idea of indexing a larger portion and just dcaing.

Some indexes I like are VTI QQQ QTEC IGV XLV IBB.

Then I have mostly blue chips like UNH MSFT AAPL GOOGL NVDA LIN UNP COST ASML LRCX etc.

But I think for the average investor with a 10 to 20 year look out, the ""bottom"" is NOW.

I mean by that that when you look back 5, 10 and 20 years from now most indexes and good companies will be a ""bottom"" compared to where they'll be in those.time frames.

So for the average investor seriously you're best bet to be successful long term is to pick an index or two, not a sector, but a broad index or two like say VTI and QQQ and just do a 50/50 weekly.

For example if you inest $100 A week, just put $50 into VTI  and QQQ each week and get on with life. You're not concerned with what happens next week, next month etc. You just keep buying!

So if you throw $50 into QQQ and it's  ""crashes"" 50% next week .... awesome!!! THATS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY!!

Always keep positive and have a positive outlook on life. Keep yourself fit and as healthy as possible and don't eat a lot of junk. Try to eat as little as you can. That's what I do now. I fast every day for at least 12 hours.

So keep buying into indexes. If you want to mess with individual  stocks I think you should keep it to about 20% of your portfolio  and maybe under 20 positions.",2424,True,1670524762.0,2022-12-08 19:39:22,0,27,apooroldinvestor,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zg7c4g/the_bottom_is_in_just_keep_dcaing_into_indexes/,True,0.41,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,zublia,,TSLA - Bull Case (Qualitative Opinion),"A lot of posts about folks dumping Tesla. Here are some counter points. I welcome feedback! Please be civil. 

1.	I sincerely doubt people are shying away from Tesla because of Elon. Even if they are, it is a short term phenomenon because of his involvement in Twitter. Like all stupid forays, this foray will come to an end as well and money will rush back in again. 

2.	Tesla makes great cars. Buyers remorse is almost non existent. People love their cars, flaws and all! There isn’t a car that is anywhere close to it from a technology perspective. (you may debate this - but find me a car that has a greater range + capabilities)

3.	Tesla does not spend a dime on advertising! Just think of the brand awareness and consideration this company has without spending a dime on advertising. Others are spending billions! Even Porsche who I think is the closest competition has billboards all over the place!

4.	They are profitable! This is not a smoke and mirror show. Maybe you say that the autopilot is a joke and not a fully featured solution. The retort would be, how many people are paying for FSD via subscription and what is the cancellation rate? It is near 5%. If Tesla is able to retain 95% of its customer base in something “frivolous” like FSD, surely there is something that FSD is doing correctly. 

5.	Tesla cars are priced where they are because of demand and supply. They are able to presell every car they produce. Obviously, the recession may cause some havoc and reduce demand in the short term. How will Tesla weather this? Based on the moves they are making, it feels like they are taking an active approach to managing staff, expenses and ultimately production. The drop in stock price is because of this! This is the uncertainty that is causing the institutional investors to reduce their positions. 

6.	Tesla has experienced meteoric growth and with the growth comes “fat” (ask any body builder).",4294,True,1671894355.0,2022-12-24 16:05:55,0,161,Infoaddict2012,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zublia/tsla_bull_case_qualitative_opinion/,True,0.47,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

post,101vx0u,,SpaceX raising $750 million at a $137 billion valuation,"Elon Musk’s re-usable rocket maker and satellite internet company, SpaceX, is raising $750 million in a new round of funding that values the company at $137 billion.

Last month, Bloomberg first reported that SpaceX was allowing insiders to sell at $77 per share, which would have put the company’s valuation near $140 billion. The company raised more than $2 billion in 2022, including a $250 million round in July, and was valued at $127 billion during an equity round in May.

post,10f6z7f,,"Tesla video promoting self driving was staged, engineer testifies","Jan 17 [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-video-promoting-self-driving-was-staged-engineer-testifies-2023-01-17/?utm_source=reddit.com) - ""A 2016 video that Tesla (TSLA.O) used to promote its self-driving technology was staged to show capabilities like stopping at a red light and accelerating at a green light that the system did not have, according to testimony by a senior engineer.

The video, which remains archived on Tesla’s website, was released in October 2016 and promoted on Twitter by Chief Executive Elon Musk as evidence that “Tesla drives itself.”

To create the video, the Tesla used 3D mapping on a predetermined route from a house in Menlo Park, California, to Tesla’s then-headquarters in Palo Alto, he said.

Drivers intervened to take control in test runs, he said. When trying to show the Model X could park itself with no driver, a test car crashed into a fence in Tesla’s parking lot, he said.

“The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system,” Tesla's lawyer said, according to a transcript of his testimony seen by Reuters.

When Tesla released the video, Musk tweeted, “Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot.”

Tesla faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny over its driver assistance systems.

The U.S. Department of Justice began a criminal investigation into Tesla’s claims that its electric vehicles can drive themselves in 2021, after a number of crashes, some of them fatal, involving Autopilot, Reuters has reported.

The New York Times reported in 2021 that Tesla engineers had created the 2016 video to promote Autopilot without disclosing that the route had been mapped in advance or that a car had crashed in trying to complete the shoot, citing anonymous sources.",2891,True,1674047229.0,2023-01-18 14:07:09,2700,604,_DeanRiding,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10f6z7f/tesla_video_promoting_self_driving_was_staged/,True,0.91,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

post,10l9spv,,Tesla earnings are out — here are the numbers,"Electric vehicle maker Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings (adjusted): $1.19 vs $1.13 per share expected, per Refinitiv

Revenue: $24.32 billion vs $24.16 billion expected, per Refinitiv

In the year-ago quarter, Tesla reported revenue of $17.72 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.52 per share.

Earlier this month, Tesla reported vehicle delivery and production numbers for the fourth quarter of 2022 that set a new record for the company, but fell shy of the company’s goals and analysts’ expectations, despite having cut prices on its cars in December to spur customers to take deliveries before the year’s end.

Tesla reported 405,278 vehicle deliveries and production of 439,701 vehicles in the period ending December 31, 2022. Full year deliveries amounted to around 1.31 million, a record for Tesla, after the company started production at its new factories in Austin, Texas, and Brandenburg, Germany.

Last year, Musk said the factories were akin to “money-burning furnaces” in an interview with an owners’ club posted to YouTube in June.

So far in 2023, Tesla has continued to cut prices on its cars around the world, upsetting customers in the US and China who recently bought new Teslas at higher prices, and triggering an instant decline in used Tesla prices in the US as well.

Tesla solicits questions ahead of their earnings calls via a site called Say.com from both retail and institutional investors.

Among other things, investors on that site say they want to know what the recent price cuts will do to Tesla’s automotive gross margins, how much the company expects to grow sales of its cars in 2023, and when Tesla plans to start mass production and deliveries of its long-delayed, sci-fi inspired, pickup truck the Cybertruck.

Throughout the fourth quarter of 2022, shareholders also sought answers from Tesla and Elon Musk about his intentions at the automaker as the price of Tesla shares declined.",3086,True,1674680972.0,2023-01-25 22:09:32,495,570,Kashyapm94,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10l9spv/tesla_earnings_are_out_here_are_the_numbers/,True,0.93,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

post,10sk1gh,,On Tesla's valuation (Part 4),"In the past I've made multiple posts on Tesla's valuation ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8ka1h/on_teslas_valuation_part_deux/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y8sdc4/on_teslas_valuation_part_trois/)).

Previously I did them after Q1 and Q3, but because the last few months have been such a rollercoaster for $TSLA and it probably makes more sense to do them after the full year numbers anyways, I decided to do this one a little bit earlier. In the future I'll just be doing them after H1 and H2.

-----------------

**Looking back**

Since my first projections started with 2022, this is the first time we can compare my projections to Tesla's actual results. As such, I figured it'd be interesting to assess how far off my projections were.

Combining the bear and bull cases for 2022 of each post into a table together with the actuals:

**Sales**

||Part 1|Part 2|Part 3|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Bear**|1,400,000|1,400,000|1,350,000|
|**Bull**|1,700,000|1,900,000|1,500,000|

Actuals: **1,313,851**

In terms of unit sales, my projections were definitely too optimistic. Tesla ended up slightly underperforming my bear cases, although a caveat here is that Tesla had 60K cars in transit at the end of 2022 and missed out on ~75K units due to COVID shutdowns in China. Without these one-time occurrences, they would've ended the year on ~1,450,000 units above my bear cases but still significantly below my bull cases.

That said, accounting for force majeure is supposed to be part of the bear case, so I need to be more conservative here in the future.

**ASP**

For ASPs, I projected $50,000, $55,000 and $54,000 respectively. Actuals came in at **$54,385**, so I was pretty much spot-on.",7131,True,1675430093.0,2023-02-03 14:14:53,33,21,Ehralur,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10sk1gh/on_teslas_valuation_part_4/,True,0.78,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,11828wr,,Switching from the Volkswagen ID4 to the Tesla Model Y Performance,"Hi,

This will be a lengthy post regarding comparing the 2 cars (VW ID4, Tesla MYP) on mostly subjective topics, but I wanted to give some insights on what I like / dislike while staying honest with myself. 

Some things I want to get out first:  


* I have 1 infant to take with me and my SO
* I live in Europe, public charging infrastructure still sucks, see below
* I 'owned' (company car) the ID4 for 1 year (25k km)
* I own (bought with my own company now) the MYP for 1 month (5k km)
* I have a tech background (software architecture)
* I've been converted from an Apple hating standpoint to an Apple fanboy in the past
* I'm not a Tesla fanboy
* I hated Tesla's seamingly cheap build quality from older models that I've driven in (Mostly US built)
* I loved Elon's memery, today I couldn't even say a good word about him due to activities
* Previous cars I drove: Renault Kangoo, Audi A1, Audi A3, BMW X2, BMW 320, Mercedes CLA, Peugeot 308 SW

&#x200B;

Configuration of the cars:

* VW ID4: Pro Max edition - Which basically meant that I had all options ticked where possible. Total car budget came to 63K Euro. Had the original black color, brown interior, black sport seats, standard rims, all other packages included
* Tesla Model Y Performance: Black exterior, black seats, towing package, basic Autopilot. Total car budget came to 67K Euro.

Other cars I was considering to replace the ID4, but didn't pick in the end (budget max was 85k Euro, had to be fiscally optimal →  EV / PHEV required):

* Audi Q4 / VW ID4 / Skoda Enyaq: Such good cars, but I wanted something different now that I could pick whatever I wanted (within budget).
* VW Tiguan (PHEV): Boring.
* Hyundai Ioniq 5 (EV): Software seemed too cluttered. The exterior design was too outspoken for me. Feature wise this was a very complete car.
* Kia EV6 (EV): I freacking loved this car, but waiting 2 years for it wasn't going to happen. Software also seemed too cluttered.",12893,True,1676982365.0,2023-02-21 13:26:05,144,101,lorpo1994,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/11828wr/switching_from_the_volkswagen_id4_to_the_tesla/,True,0.82,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

post,118ov3t,,"Drove a Model 3 for a week, here are my thoughts","**Things I love.**

One pedal driving. In Low Regen mode it was a dream. Standard mode it was a bit too jerky for my tastes.

Seat support was comfortable and sat me at 6' tall real well.

Auto Accelerate after complete stop in Autopilot. Underrated feature. I hate having to tell my HDA equiped Kia to go again.

The built-in interface is the best, hands down, of any car I have been in. Super fluid and intuitive. Way less distracting to navigate around while driving than I thought it would be. I got used to not having a cluster in front of me super quick. Totally changed my mind on needing physical buttons, IF other cars interfaces were this good.

Sound quality is amazing.

No squeaks or rattles. Fit, trim, finish was great. (Contrary to so many complaints)

Loved the walk up/walk away unlock/lock.

Handling and acceleration was amazing.

Super chargers are by and far the best experience out there, period.

**Things I hate.**

Interface is still buggy. Cameras would get stuck loading. Backup cam would only pop up about half the time. Would miss a tap from my finger occasionally.

Auto pilot did everything about 1 second after I would as a driver. Curve coming up in the road, it would wait until the very last split second to start curving. Someone pull out in front of you? It would wait until the last second and slam on the brakes, even if the other car was no longer in front of you. When you as the driver would take back over, it would slightly jerk and turn off auto steer, SUPER annoying. My HDA equiped Kia lets you do gradual corrections without disengaging auto steer and without jerking the steering wheel.

Spotify didn't allow offline downloads so every cellular signal loss means my playlist stopped at the end of the current song.

Lack of Android Auto really holds it back. Their navigation got me lost on my first trip when it lost cellphone coverage. I unknowingly missed a turn and it had me go 5 miles out of my way just to turn around.",5466,True,1677040151.0,2023-02-22 05:29:11,103,182,computerguy0-0,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/118ov3t/drove_a_model_3_for_a_week_here_are_my_thoughts/,True,0.75,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,129p9mt,,Rented a Model 3 for work through Hertz for 2 weeks - trip report,"TLDR: I had a fantastic experience renting a Tesla Model 3 from Hertz, would highly recommend to anyone, and I will definitely do it again.  


Background: I drive a 2021 Tesla Model 3 SR+ LFP unicorn at home, so I'm already familiar with Teslas in general. The car I ended up renting was a 2022 Tesla Model 3 SR+ (which I'm assuming is LFP as well).

I recently worked in the Dallas Texas metro area for about 2 weeks. I knew I was going to be doing a lot of driving and field testing of equipment. I was thrilled to find that renting a Tesla Model 3 through Hertz was actually the least expensive option! I originally booked it for 1 week, and the price difference between the Model 3 and the cheapest economy ICE car was only $25 (for the whole week!), with unlimited mileage. If you account for the cost of charging versus the cost of gas based on how much I knew I was going to drive (well more than 100 miles), the EV was actually about the same cost or cheaper than the gas car.

  
The process of getting to the car could have been smoother if the Hertz app actually worked, but going through the counter was fine, it just took longer. My primary two questions were: how were they going to handle the keys, and how were they going to handle charging. The counter agent was able to answer both questions. They provide the keycard in a plastic holder so you don't mix it up with your own. That system works fine. Only problem I saw was lots of small scratches in the car glass where people were sliding the keycard against it (they should emphasize that it only takes a tap, not a slide). Hertz was using metal airline cord as part of the keycard holder, and the metal was the bit that would scratch the glass. I'm sure they'll iterate a better solution here in the future, its an easy fix.

As for charging, each car is registered with the Supercharging network, so you can just drive up and plug in as per normal. On the back end it gets charged to Hertz.",7626,True,1680450914.0,2023-04-02 17:55:14,74,64,minimal-camera,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/129p9mt/rented_a_model_3_for_work_through_hertz_for_2/,True,0.81,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,12gxn5y,,Mach-E -> '23 MYLR. Not Happy (Biggest complaint is phantom braking),"Is it OK to post in this sub an overall negative feeling about owning a Tesla? I sure hope so, because the tl;dr of it all is I really miss my Mach-E. 

That's not to say that my MY doesn't have some advantages over my Mach-E. I'll list them first: 

- Charging network. This was my main driver in getting a Tesla. My elderly parents live about 300 miles away and though CCS / EA was getting me home it was still a challenge. There are many more Tesla options between my home and theirs so even if a charger is down I won't be stranded. Also the Tesla in-network charging experience is far better than EA's. I lost count of the number of stalls EA had that were dead or the number of charging sessions that'd kick off for a few minutes then just...stop. With Tesla you just back in, plug in and that is it. It's seriously magical compared to the hot garbage that EA is. 

- Infotainment / Tech. The biggest advantage is no lag at all and a ton of useful information ready to go when sitting down. The iOS app is also far superior to Ford's. Ford's lag though was notably better when I traded it in so I wonder if they're continuing to work on the lag. Dashcam as part of the base car's features is really neat. Phone as a key works great, I gave up on it with my Mach-E.



Ok, now the disadvantages: 

- Quality: I've had my car in for service three times now. Two were factory screw ups including a missing part of my front brakes. Wow. One was error codes relating to the vision system they had to replace a camera. I need to bring it in a fourth time now because a back window doesn't close all the way each time the door is shut. About 20% of the time the door will shut but the window will not go up to seal so I have to open it and close it again. Annoying to have to double check each time. Also embarrassing to be laughed at by friends when they see it happen. My Mach-E spent one night in the shop due to a recall and I got a loaner.

# Five Years of Model 3 Ownership by the Numbers

**58,168** \- Odometer reading - This works out 11,633 miles per year, under the average 13,500 miles per year driven by US drivers. I have a short commute.

**14,115’** \- Highest Elevation Driven - Pike’s Peak, Colorado. The battery charged from 42% to 52% on the way back down.

**7385** \- Sequence number of the car, aka the 7385th Model 3 built by Tesla. Approximately 1.9 million have been manufactured since making this car older than 99.6% of Model 3’s you see on the road.

**2,805 mi** \- Longest Road Trip - Ohio to Colorado Springs and back in the summer of 2020.

**261** \- Watt-hours per mile consumed - this is the average efficiency of the car throughout its lifetime.  A single gallon of gasoline contains 33,700 watt-hours of energy. This means 261 Wh/mi is the same as 129 mpg (33,700/261).  Thanks for the correction, commenters. I somehow messed up the math in the original post.

**94%** \- Percentage of charges that took place at home.

**74** \- Software updates (since I started counting in Jan 2019 - so there were more). Software updates download via the internet, just as they do to your cell phone. Some features added over the years that the car didn’t come with include: The ability to change lanes automatically on the highway and autonomously take highway exits, the ability to drive autonomously in a parking lot and pick me up at the door, Spotify, Netflix, video games, and a fart machine.

post,12kkdkr,,Why Tesla is losing its EV dominance ?," 

Tesla ($TSLA) should be looking over its shoulder at the fully charged EVs barreling right toward its castle.

While Elon Musk's non-Twitter creation still has a stronghold on the EV market based on name recognition, market share, and production capabilities, the clear takeaway from this year’s New York International Auto Show (which Tesla was not a part of) is that traditional automakers such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Nissan (NSANY) are all gunning for Tesla's dominance and lucrative profit margins. 

## Hyundai aims to lead the EV pack

“Tesla who,” Hyundai Motor Americas CEO Randy Parker quipped when Yahoo Finance Live asked about Hyundai's IONIQ 6, an EV that was named 'Car of the Year' for 2023.

The impressive specs and pricing of Hyundai's IONIQ 6 places it in direct competition with Tesla's Model 3, the second-most-popular EV in the U.S. Hyundai's IONIQ 6 starts at $41,600 with a range of up to 240 miles. By comparison, the $41,990 Model 3 reaches 272 miles on one charge.

Gap closed.

“The IONIQ 6 from a technology standpoint, you can’t do better,” Parker crowed.

And it’s that type of Tesla mentality that’s likely to test the EV leadership of Musk's EV outfit.

Older automakers known for their gas-powered rides are ramping up their push into the EV market with edgy new styles and attractive specs like those showcased at this year's New York Auto Show, including the Kia EV9, Nissan Ariya, Chevrolet Equinox EV, and Ram 1500 REV electric truck.

These will be added to a class of solid EVs already in the market like Ford's F-150 Lightning and Mach-E and the coming Chevy Silverado.

## What's next for Tesla

Tesla's Cybertruck isn't even on the market yet. The company is reportedly working on a compact EV dubbed the Model 2, but it's unclear when that will arrive. 

S&P Global estimates the EV market will grow from just over 50 models today to 78 by year-end before more than doubling to 160 by the end of 2025.",4278,True,1681382178.0,2023-04-13 12:36:18,0,126,ProcedureFun410,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12kkdkr/why_tesla_is_losing_its_ev_dominance/,True,0.37,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

post,12nld46,,I recently upgraded from a 2018 Model 3 to a 2023 Model Y. My thoughts on 5 years of Tesla ownership...,"So when Tesla dropped their prices on the Model Y *and* it qualified for the tax credit again, I figured it was finally time to replace my Model 3. I'd had about 4.5 good years with it, but a bunch of little things were starting to get on my nerves enough that I felt like an upgrade was in order.

1. Degradation hadn't been bad by any means, but it hadn't been nothing. The battery was down to 292 miles of rated range from the initial 310 my LR RWD Model 3 started with (~6% degradation in 4.5 years). It was supposed to get an upgrade to 325 a few months after I got it, but it never did. Getting a Model Y would mean I'd get another 40 miles of range, since the Y gets 330 when new.
2. My Model 3's efficiency had absolutely gone to shit in recent months. When it was new, I'd regularly get between 200 and 240 Wh/mi on my commute in good weather (depending on traffic), but even in good weather I was regularly getting well over 300 Wh/mi since mid-2022. I think that was a result of using Michelin CrossClimate2 tires, and possibly other factors.
3. I had to bring this car in for a lot of service. The final count of unscheduled mobile service and service center visits was over 10, though one of those was because some ground squirrels that had been infesting my parents' property ate some of my wires... That was an expensive repair, but the rest of the unscheduled service visits were free.
4. The motor's inverter failed back in April 2022, and my car was stranded in the unusually low-roofed parking structure where it happened until the next morning, due to Teslas needing to be towed on flatbeds. Once the car eventually got towed to a service center, they took three weeks to get a replacement inverter installed. It would have been two weeks, except that their first replacement also failed, so they had to wait for another. The car ran flawlessly after that, though.
5. Being a 2018, this Model 3 was missing a lot of the QoL features of modern Teslas.",10742,True,1681598199.0,2023-04-16 00:36:39,588,550,coredumperror,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/12nld46/i_recently_upgraded_from_a_2018_model_3_to_a_2023/,True,0.89,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,12s8m77,,Tesla net income and earnings drop more than 20% from last year,"Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv

Revenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates

Net income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.

Automotive revenue, Tesla’s core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.

Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.

The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.

Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.

Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.


Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management’s consideration were seeking updates on the company’s trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company’s energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.

In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.

A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas.",2607,True,1681935275.0,2023-04-19 22:14:35,3455,871,Kashyapm94,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12s8m77/tesla_net_income_and_earnings_drop_more_than_20/,True,0.94,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1493mza,,Tesla stock extends record streak to 13 sessions,"Tesla shares are up a whopping 41% during that time.

  
Tesla ($TSLA) shares jumped 3.6% today, extending the company’s record winning streak to 13 sessions in a row. In that time, shares have risen nearly 42%, adding further gains to an already big year for Tesla shareholders.

  
Tesla stock is rising in tandem with the overall market today on cooling inflation data, but the shares have been on the rise for a couple weeks now. The latest big news came late last week when General Motors (GM) announced it was joining forces with Tesla to leverage the electric vehicle maker's Supercharger Network. The companies announced the Tesla Supercharger Network will be open to GM EV drivers starting next year, and by 2025 GM anticipates its EVs will include Tesla’s NACs connector, which will allow for direct access to Tesla Superchargers.

GM’s move comes two weeks after Ford (F) announced a similar partnership with Tesla to enable access for Ford vehicles to Tesla's charging network.  
Several industry analysts recently told Yahoo Finance that Tesla's partnership with Ford would be a positive tailwind for Tesla's revenue moving forward.  
""Recall in our 2022 report that we sized the potential for Tesla opening its network more widely in the next few years (i.e. more than just Ford) at $1-$3 bn of incremental revenue (although Tesla wouldn’t necessarily capture all of this),"" Goldman analyst Mark Delaney wrote in a note following the Ford deal. ""We believe the news is a modest incremental positive for Tesla as it will likely bring in additional profits and help Tesla to sustain the most robust charging network, albeit with some risk of fewer vehicle sales.""Nonetheless it hasn’t all been good news for Tesla during the recent run-up, as the stock brushed aside negative reports about the upcoming and highly anticipated Cybertruck.",2800,True,1686736088.0,2023-06-14 11:48:08,546,283,Ben_aid,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1493mza/tesla_stock_extends_record_streak_to_13_sessions/,True,0.88,2023,both,search,False,False,0,
post,149ifrq,,"Chinese EV giant BYD overtakes Tesla, but can it crack the U.S. market? (Washington Post)","By Meaghan Tobin, Lyric Li

Thai YouTube star Jo Chirawatt recently took two of the best-selling electric cars in Thailand for a test drive. One was Tesla’s Model 3. The other was the Atto 3, made by Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD.

The Atto 3 marked “the iPhone moment” for EVs, Chirawatt told his nearly 900,000 YouTube followers, suggesting it would set off a hype cycle that would transform a novelty purchase into a mainstream luxury. For most of the world, previous generations of EVs were aspirational purchases.

From Bangkok to Tel Aviv, BYD — which stands for “Build Your Dreams” — has been pushing to make EVs mass-market.

The Chinese car company, which has also sold low-priced gasoline-powered cars for more than a decade, has this year surpassed Tesla to become the top-selling EV brand in the world.

At the Shanghai auto show in April, the company’s biggest bid yet to capture the global market for affordable EVs was unveiled in the tiniest package, with the lowest price tag: a compact battery-powered hatchback called the Seagull that sells for just over $11,000.

“The Seagull was the shot heard around the world when it comes to affordability of electric vehicles,” said Bill Russo, founder and chief executive of the Shanghai-based advisory firm Automobility.

This year has marked a moment of arrival not just for BYD but for the much-maligned Chinese auto sector as a whole.

The country exported 1.07 million cars in the first quarter of this year, according to China’s Association of Automobile Manufacturers — overtaking Japan to become the world’s top auto exporter.

One out of every four of those cars was electric. BYD models are now the top-selling electric vehicles in Thailand, Israel, New Zealand and Singapore.

Like many Chinese tech companies before it, BYD has targeted fast-growing emerging markets without strong local brands. It did the same with its earlier gas-powered cars, selling across South America, Africa and the Middle East.",6813,True,1686775016.0,2023-06-14 22:36:56,0,12,bitemy,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/149ifrq/chinese_ev_giant_byd_overtakes_tesla_but_can_it/,True,0.46,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

3 Low-Priced REITs Making Big Moves
Mentioned:	BDN CIO DHC HPP UNIT
Several low-priced real estate investment trusts (REITs) made huge moves higher this week, and many are in the office or healthcare subsectors.

Investors know that low-priced stocks can be volatile, and it's as easy to lose as it is to gain a lot in the short term. These stocks are not for conservative investors or for people on a fixed income who cannot afford to take large risks with their capital.

But abrupt new moves in a low-priced stock often portend even more future gains to come. If an investor is patient and perhaps waits for a price pullback off a spike, it is possible to do quite well on these trades.

Take a look at three low-priced REITs that have blasted higher on increasing volume this week.

Don't miss: The Company That Built Elon Musk's Tiny Home Is Partnering With This REIT To Solve The Affordable Housing Crisis And Provide A Unique Investment Opportunity

Diversified Healthcare Trust (NASDAQ: DHC) is a Newton, Massachusetts-based healthcare REIT that owns 376 healthcare-related properties of approximately $7.1 billion across 36 states and Washington, D.C. In addition to over 100 life science and medical offices, Diversified Healthcare Trust also has 27,389 senior living community units in its portfolio.

In April, Office Properties Income Trust (NASDAQ: OPI) announced it was acquiring Diversified Healthcare Trust in an all-share transaction. It seemed like a done deal because in May, Office Properties Income Trust began to implement the financing needed to complete the transaction.

&#x200B;

1. LUCID never intended to be a successful car company, but rather they intended to be an engineering firm and their cars are just being used to showcase their technology and gain publicity.   
The Air came out as a large luxury sedan. That is the most overcrowded EV segment, but it shows that LUCID is prioritizing its engineering over all else. Ever decision about the car was made from an engineering standpoint. The body is an ugly sedan, because that's the most aerodynamic shape. Its a luxury car to help hide the expensive costs of the battery and other electric drive train components. All of the drive-train components are some of, if not the best components in any electric vehicle. There are videos on youtube that LUCID posts that go into extensive details of why they are so efficient. LUCID has one single video on design posted. Its under a minute long and basically says that it was designed by the engineering team for efficiency.  
We're already seeing them begin to do engineering work for other companies like Aston Martin and this trend will only continue to grow.
2. Several traditional car companies are pricing themselves out of relevancy and leaving a huge gap in the market for startups and Chinese car companies to come in and take over. People can't buy exactly what they want. They have to select from the choices that they're given. As most car companies have raised their prices significantly in the last couple of years, consumers generally still have to pick from any of the now expensive cars. There is now a huge hole in the lower end of the new car marketplace for someone to come in and make a killing with a half-decent offering.",5035,True,1688858848.0,2023-07-09 01:27:28,757,1290,Jimmaayy,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/14uirtn/potentially_controversial_car_opinions_thread/,True,0.87,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

post,14x44f2,,How Nasdaq 100 ‘Special Rebalance’ on July 24 will affect tech stocks,"On July 7 [Nasdaq announced](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/the-nasdaq-100-index-special-rebalance-to-be-effective-july-24-2023-2023-07-07) its third-ever 'special rebalance' of the Nasdaq 100 index, which will take effect July 24, 2023.

As a result of the rebalance, you should expect Nasdaq to [significantly decrease the weight of the largest stocks](https://www.tastylive.com/news-insights/everything-you-need-to-know-about-what-will-happen-to-the-nasdaq-after-the-special-rebalance) ($MSFT, $AAPL, $GOOGL/$GOOG, $NVDA, and $AMZN) from a total of 43+% to below a 38.5% maximum. TSLA may also see a small downward weighting. Smaller stocks should see a small increase in the weight.

ETFs/mutual funds that try to follow the Nasdaq 100 (such as $QQQ) will need to adjust their holdings accordingly. So you should expect them to sell the largest stocks and buy the smaller ones -- perhaps they already have -- and that will affect the prices of those stocks accordingly.

It also means that those ETFs/mutual funds will not accurately reflect the relative weight of the largest stocks. So if you wish to be weighted according to actual market cap, you would need to supplement those holdings.

Normally the index rebalances every quarter. But the largest stocks are dominating the index and funds that follow the index need to maintain compliance with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule on fund diversification. On July 3, the largest six stocks saw their combined weight reach 50.9% of the index.

u/elonmusk also [fails to mention](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/elon-musk-says-ev-range-is-overrated-beyond-certain-point-debate-ensues-183143.html
) any of the negatives of not having a 400+ mile range EV. Elon mentions longer range making acceleration worse et al. I would rather have 400+ mile range than 4-5 second acceleration. ""Chill mode"" is plenty fast enough IMHO.

Other factors that impact range assessments (many of which do not affect ICE vehicles):

1) owners who cannot charge EV at home

2) battery drain from Sentry Mode

3) battery drain from Bioweapon Defense Mode

4) battery drain from car just sitting unused at a parking structure while you travel

5) battery drain from ""entertainment use"" when not connected to a charger

6) also not mentioned in articles I see is the degradation that is common in batteries if persistent 100% charging is done, so the owner should be routinely charging to only about 80% of the full battery capacity. And with battery degradation, over the years, owner will see less and less range. (Tesla batteries that can charge to 100% are often software locked to like 84% of battery's full capacity)

7) battery drain from hold/cold weather (due to EV battery needing to be kept at certain temperatures). In my experience ICE vehicle range is only affected negatively by cold temperatures.

I acknowledge there are problems with increased weight of EVs and adding increased range can worsen this. So it's not a simple thing. But the negatives of small range EVs should be mentioned/discussed when advocating that lower range EVs are enough.",1779,False,1689509629.0,2023-07-16 14:13:49,0,42,weavd1,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1514ror/yes_i_do_think_i_need_at_least_400_miles_of_range/,True,0.37,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

> Stock futures were little changed Monday ahead of a busy week for corporate earnings.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 54 points, or 0.16%, while S&P 500 futures slipped 0.05%. Futures connected to the Nasdaq-100 traded 0.1% higher.
*****
> Stocks are coming off a winning week that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average gain 2.3% to notch its best weekly gain since March. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 2.4% and 3.3%, respectively. On Friday, the Dow rose 113.89 points, or 0.33%, while the S&P and Nasdaq slipped 0.1% and 0.18%, respectively.
*****
> The moves came on the heels of solid big bank earnings and softer inflation reports that lifted investor sentiment. That heightened some hopes the Federal Reserve may be able to tamp down inflation without tipping the economy into a recession.
*****
> “It’s the Goldilocks scenario, it’s inflation coming down with near record low unemployment,” Kathryn Rooney Vera, chief market strategist at StoneX, told CNBC’s “Last Call” on Friday. “Yes, people have some pain ... with prices, but they have jobs. Evidence is increasingly favorable for the soft landing viewpoint, and immaculate disinflation is what has the market going crazy.”
*****
> Second-quarter earnings season gains steam this week with results from big financial institutions such as Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Results are also due from United Airlines, Las Vegas Sands and technology giants Tesla and Netflix.

post,15b4qg7,,Source: Tesla rigged the dashboard to overstate battery range; created a “Diversion Team” to suppress thousands of complaints,"In March, Alexandre Ponsin set out on a family road trip from Colorado to California in his newly purchased Tesla, a used 2021 Model 3. He expected to get something close to the electric sport sedan’s advertised driving range: 353 miles on a fully charged battery.

He soon realized he was sometimes getting less than half that much range, particularly in cold weather – such severe underperformance that he was convinced the car had a serious defect.

“We’re looking at the range, and you literally see the number decrease in front of your eyes,” he said of his dashboard range meter.

Ponsin contacted Tesla and booked a service appointment in California. He later received two text messages, telling him that “remote diagnostics” had determined his battery was fine, and then: “We would like to cancel your visit.”

What Ponsin didn’t know was that Tesla employees had been instructed to thwart any customers complaining about poor driving range from bringing their vehicles in for service. Last summer, the company quietly created a “Diversion Team” in Las Vegas to cancel as many range-related appointments as possible.

The Austin, Texas-based electric carmaker deployed the team because its service centers were inundated with appointments from owners who had expected better performance based on the company’s advertised estimates and the projections displayed by the in-dash range meters of the cars themselves, according to several people familiar with the matter.

post,15fr5me,,Is Tesla really here to stay?,"(Not intended as a bait post, but a serious question)

A little over 10 years has passed since the [first deliveries of the Model S](https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-motors-begin-customer-deliveries-model-s-june-22nd), and without getting into the politics/psychology of the CEO or the enthusiast relevance of their cars, the company itself seems like it's entering a period of stability (uh, relatively speaking). They continue to deliver cars in volume, and [it looks like that volume is increasing.](https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/tesla-us-sales-figures/#:~:text=TESLA%20ANNUAL%20SALES%20AND%20MARKET%20SHARE) According to their [latest quarterly report,](https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/TSLA-Q2-2023-Update.pdf) their other business ventures are at least not a major source of drag on their financials, and unlike earlier years, [starting in 2021](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594778/tesla-q2-2021-earnings-revenue-profit-credits-emissions-bitcoin) Tesla isn't (at least part of the time) relying on resale of energy credits to be profitable. In short, they're making more cars and the company is probably actually profitable.

They have introduced desirable new products since 2017 (Model 3 and Model Y), and continue to be seen -- at least by investors and competitors -- as a market leader in North America in the EV space. And while they face [increasing competition abroad](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-electric-vehicle-market-share/) from Chinese brands and traditional automakers, they remain a powerful force outside North America too, which certainly seems to indicate that Tesla's products are desirable as well.

-----------------

**Sales**

Last time I lowered my bear case for 2023 to 1.7M, with 2.15M sales expected and 2.4M in the bull case. With 889K cars sold in H1 and the announced retooling for the Model 3 refresh, I expect them to comfortably exceed my bear case, but believe the bull case needs to lowered to 2.2M for an expected amount of sales of 1.95M for the full year. With the slightly slower ramp in Texas and Berlin, the slower than expected rollout of the Cybertruck and Mexico only coming online by the end of 2024 at the earliest, I will also lower the bull cases for 2024 and 2025 from 3.4M and 4.8M respectively:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|1,800,000|2,200,000|
|**2024**|2,400,000|3,000,000|
|**2025**|3,000,000|4,400,000|

**ASP**

I expected Tesla to decrease ASPs from $54,385 to ~$51K in 2023. With ASPs of $46,379 in H1, and although I expect ASPs to be higher in H2, I will also lower my expectations here to $47K.

I then expect ASPs to increase to $49K in 2024 and then start to decline with the introduction of the compact car, starting with $48K in 2025.",4023,True,1691147399.0,2023-08-04 13:09:59,18,15,Ehralur,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15hx56g/on_teslas_valuation_part_5/,True,0.71,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,15xs05u,,TESLA will Cyber Truck sell well and move share price to a new all time high?,"Have to be honest with you I don’t currently have a position in Tesla. But I am intrigued about what I’m hearing regarding the release of the cyber truck. Evidently they have a lot of orders currently with big deposits, along with a backlog of 1,900,000 orders waiting to be filled with a late 2023 or early 2024 release date.  
According to this article, that is a five-year backlog.  

“Tesla Cybertruck Orders Surpass 1.9 Million, 5 Year Wait Times” 

There are now over 1.9 million orders for the long-awaited Tesla Cybertruck, per a crowd-sourced data tracker. Speaking on an Earnings Call earlier this week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated that demand for the Cybertruck is ""so off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.”

Given that Tesla plans to produce 375,000 Cybertrucks a year at peak capacity, new orders will technically take around 5 years to arrive. 

It seems to me that Tesla would be a great place to jump in if it falls to $200 per share.  I don’t see it going much lower than $200.00 

Recent history:
52 week history $101.81 low and $313.00 high.

post,164tjkl,,How does Tesla go up 7% after all the news about Elon Musk’s autopilot incident?,"I guess I need to add this: I do **not** own any stocks or shorts or puts or whatever related to Tesla, because the way that Tesla works in the market confuses me. I just want to learn. 

Everybody also thinks this is an attack on Tesla and Musk. It is **not**. I want to know if this is the way that the market works or not.

Why do I care? Because Tesla is relatively a gigantic company. Why did I ask about if the same would happen with Apple? Because Apple is also a relatively gigantic company. 

I thought you were allowed to ask about stocks on this sub. 

———

On Friday August 25th, [Elon Musk posted a video on X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1695247110030119054?s=46&t=0YLBKtmQe8-F_nJ00NQvxg), that now has 44 million views, of him driving a Tesla on autopilot. In the video he has to brake the car himself when it almost runs a red light (at around 19:45). It also received a decent amount of news coverage. 

This appears to have not affected the stock’s value at all and as of the closing today (August 29th) the stock is up over 7%

I’d expect such an incident to have negative effects on a company’s value, but this didn’t. 

Are these sorts of things usually just not big deals? 

If Apple were demonstrating their new iPhone’s amazing app that works perfectly and then it caused the phone to crash, would that negatively affect the value?

Or is it basically all just about the money that the company brings in?

—— 

Thanks to everybody who answered nicely. I’ve gotten some explanations that make sense including:

- Elon’s livestream video wasn’t of current autopilot software on Teslas, but rather a beta FSD which performed very well. 
- 44 million people probably didn’t actually see that moment where “human intervention” takes place. Plus the media blew it out of proportion. 
- Computer trading algorithms don’t care about these minute things. 
- This isn’t exclusive to Tesla. Similar things like this happening to other gigantic companies happen and they barely matter.",2142,True,1693341198.0,2023-08-29 22:33:18,1181,852,--throwaway,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/164tjkl/how_does_tesla_go_up_7_after_all_the_news_about/,True,0.82,2023,both,search,False,False,0,
post,16538eb,,"Model Y vs Mach E - couldn't decide so got both, will update reviews long-term","I'll be living with a 2023 Mach E (premium trim, standard range) and 2023 Model Y (AWD, standard range), and since I'm sure there are others weighing these two options, figured I'd share some initial thoughts but then also update this thread (or post new one?) periodically long-term too.

The test parameters are that I will alternate between the two cars as much as possible for fair comparison. I'm starting my first real job out of school, and will be driving much more than before. About 40 miles per way, 3 days a week, so will be able to evaluate each's autopilot setups.

Initial thoughts:

\- Buying experience: TIE: For the Mach E, working with a dealer is definitely annoying compared to Tesla's fixed prices and quick pickup experience. HOWEVER, credit to dealership in that they had dozens of Mach E's of varying configurations on the lot at once to physically inspect. Also more fun colors than Tesla, without extra charge. I want to hate dealerships as much as most people on this sub, but there are some small and non-trivial benefits.

\- Initial drives: SLIGHT EDGE TO MY. Model Y's power delivery is so smooth and intuitive, their experience in EV shows here. While Mach E also had plenty adequate power and optional one pedal driving, somehow felt slightly less connected to the driver. Online review videos praised the sporty handling of Mach E compared to Model Y, I'm not sure I'm noticing night and day difference quite yet, but maybe with time I'll appreciate it more.

\- Interior/Exterior quality:  MACH E WINS. Very pleased with the Mach E, when tapping on the exterior panels there's a solid metal sound compared to plasticky echo tapping the Model Y. The interior has more contrasting colors/textures/ambient lighting (that's subtle and not distracting). And the driver's central screen! Such a small thing and I thought I was perfectly happy and adapted to Model Y's center screen, but no it truly is better to have a central speedometer.

post,1678qh0,,Model 3 LR vs ID.7 SR – who will win the sales battle?,"I believe these two models – the Model 3 Long Range (LE: not Performance!!!) and the ID.7 “standard range” will be cross-shopped. They are both sedans, similar range and efficiency and similar pricing.

The ID.7 is 24 cm longer, but I think most people considering a Model 3 LR will not dismiss an ID.7 because it is that much longer, the vice-versa will be more likely.

The WLTP range is similar for the 19” wheels – 629 km (391 miles) for the Model 3 LR and 621 km (385 miles) for the ID.7 and because the battery is about the same – 77 kWh usable – the efficiency is about the same. But maybe I’m wrong with the Model 3 LR battery since the figures are not official.

But the Model 3 LR can also be equipped with 18” wheels of the “aero” type which significantly increase the range to 678 km (421 miles) – according to Tesla at least, because this is not WLTP certified yet. That is +8% vs the 19"" - I really want to see this tested :)

The ID.7 is RWD, but the Model 3 LR is AWD – I think this is a major factor in favor of the Model 3 LR.

The Model 3 unfortunately comes with buttons on the steering wheel for the turning signal instead of slacks which I believe will be very peculiar to use when leaving a roundabout  and the steering wheel is upside-down and the buttons will point the opposite.

Charing - when max power available, the Model 3 LR will probably get you from 10% to 80% in 25 min while the ID.7 in 28 min. I guess a 3 min difference in favor of Model 3 is fair.

In Germany the ID.7 starts at 57k EUR and includes lots of features as standard, the Model 3 LR starts at 52k EUR, but adding the Enhanced Autopilot would bring the car to 57k EUR just like the ID.7 – not sure though if you actually need this to be on par with the various driving assist functions included in the ID.7 as standard (Travel Assist, Lane Assist, Emergency Assist, Side Assist, Rear Traffic Alert, exit warning system).

post,16ay1rz,,Rented a Polestar 2,"Full disclosure: I’m a Tesla guy, with an old MS @160k miles and a ‘22 MYP.

I reserved a full size car from Hertz for a trip I am currently on. When I checked in they did not have any standard full size cars but offered me a Polestar instead for the same price. I asked about the charging situation and was told there are plenty so I agreed. The car was charged to 98% which made me take a mental note to never buy a prior rental EV. At first I hated the driving dynamics because regen braking was off. Once I figured that out it was actually a great drive, with strong regen braking all the way to a stop. Acceleration was snappy and similar to my S85 but much slower than the MYP. 

Negatives compared to Tesla: I know this will be controversial but the interior was just okay. There is a circular knob in front of the shifter for controlling volume. Why wasn’t this put on the steering wheel instead?? Too many buttons. I’ve spent the past 6 years with the minimalist interior of the S and everything has worked great. There are also way too many buttons on the steering wheel and you usually have to look at it to figure out which one to press. Speaking of the shifter, that also could have been on a steering wheel stalk and saved a lot of space. Charging was a pain. There were Tesla superchargers near me but I couldn’t use those. I had to use PlugShare to find the fastest chargers that were close by, and those happened to be 40kW stations. I had to download an app and load money onto it for that to work. These charged me a per hour rate as I’m currently visiting Canada and that must be a thing here. I did not want to spend extra time charging so I am going to pay the $35CAD fee for returning an under-charged car.

post,16gydkf,,Rent a Tesla with enhanced autopilot?,"All Teslas include Autopilot, which is adaptive cruise control and auto-center in the lane.  Hertz seems to call these Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (TACC) and Autosteer.

Enhanced Autopilot adds navigating on autopilot and automatic lane changing.  (It says it includes more, but it sounds like most people don't have access to the additional autopark, summon, and smart summon yet.)

Full self-driving includes traffic light and stop sign control.  The beta program includes autosteering on city streets.

Are rentals available with enhanced autopilot?  Looking at Hertz, they don't mention its features.  Looking on Turo at the 20 or so Teslas near me, none of them mention enhanced autopilot or automatic lane changing.  Turo unfortunately doesn't let you speak with the owner until you book.  (You can always cancel...)

I'm taking a 1000 mile round trip that is all highway except about 2 miles at each end, and I'd love to have that.  I understand enhanced autopilot's limitations, and that I have to be attentive, ready to take over, touch the steering wheel periodically, and can't be distracted or sleep or anything.

Do I just need to give up on this, or are there places that have paid the $6,000 upgrade fee for enhanced autopilot that rent?  I'm kind of surprised there's rental places that have spent $2,000 for red paint, but not $6,000 enhanced autopilot.

>Tesla had long been a target of investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and these picked up after the 2021 removal of radar. In a study, it recorded 273 accidents by Tesla drivers using some level of driver-assist systems, five of which resulted in deaths. It also opened an investigation into eleven Tesla crashes with emergency vehicles.

>Musk was convinced that bad drivers rather than bad software were the main reason for most of the accidents.

>At one meeting, he suggested using data collected from the car's cameras—one of which is inside the car and focused on the driver—to prove when there was driver error. One of the women at the table pushed back. ""We went back and forth with the privacy team about that,"" she said. ""We cannot associate the selfie streams to a specific vehicle, even when there's a crash, or at least that's the guidance from our lawyers.""

>Musk was not happy. The concept of ""privacy teams"" did not warm his heart. ""I am the decision-maker at this company, not the privacy team,"" he said. ""I don't even know who they are. They are so private you never know who they are."" There were some nervous laughs. ""Perhaps we can have a pop-up where we tell people that if they use FSD [Full Self-Driving], we will collect data in the event of a crash,"" he suggested. ""Would that be okay?""

post,16uiioh,,How Much Is Tesla Worth? You Decide,"Wall Street Journal out with an article that lets you plug in 5 simple variables to get a valuation for Tesla.

The 5 variables are: how many cars Tesla sells in 2030, average selling price of a Tesla car in 2030 in today’s dollars, operating margin, cost of capital, and how much Tesla’s other operations are worth.

The Wall Street Journal has 4 pre-set scenarios:

1. Bearish - $58.5 billion valuation based on 5 million cars at $30k with 8% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $0 valuation for other operations besides cars

2. Default - $381 billion valuation based on 7 million cars at $30k with 10% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $200 billion valuation for other operations.

3. Bullish - $770 billion valuation based on 10 million cars at $30k with 12% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, $400 billion for other operations

4. Superfan - $2.33 trillion valuation based on 20 million cars at $30k with 15% operating margin, 8% cost of capital, $600 billion for other operations

Their assumptions are as follows:

> Our model is based on estimates of Tesla’s future cash flows. It multiplies anticipated vehicle sales in 2030 by the average anticipated price to calculate revenue, and then applies the expected operating margin to arrive at operating profit. Estimates for the years before 2030 assume a smooth path in the variables from this year’s FactSet analyst consensus.

> Operating profit is taxed at an 11% rate (FactSet consensus for Tesla in 2023). Cash flows are then calculated as posttax operating profit minus capital expenditures while adding back depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures are assumed to be a flat 7% of revenue and depreciation and amortization 20% of capital expenditures.

> Estimated cash flows through 2030 are discounted back to their present value at the discount rate and aggregated. A terminal value is added to account for Tesla’s cash flows beyond 2030, assuming a steady-state growth rate of 5%.",2699,True,1695913674.0,2023-09-28 17:07:54,0,36,32no,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/16uiioh/how_much_is_tesla_worth_you_decide/,True,0.46,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,16ve56l,,Industries with Blue Chip Growth stocks that aren't tech ?,"My personal portfolio is heavily weighted on Tech. I have been risk averse, so most of it is in Blue Chip Tech companies who are well positioned to take advantage of the upcoming technological revolutions but also have solid revenue making product moats. (MSFT, AAPL). I also have a HUGE unvested position in the AI revolution. So no more money in AI for me.

As I look towards diversifying my portfolio, I am struggling to find any industry that also meets the following demands:

* Solid products that will make money today and 50 years from now
* Sane P/E ratios (Keep it under 50 at least)
* Poised to take advantage of one of the upcoming technological revolutions (ie. can expand their market)
* Hard to beat Moat

The other industries that seem to have strong potential are the kind that have been losing money through the likes of Cathy Woods different ARK ETFs. All of Genomics, Drug Development, Space, 3D printing etc. are bleeding money by double digit percentages every year. Manufacturing companies are slowly revolutionizing, but I don't see their market expanding in a fashion that lets their stocks explode. Many others like mining & energy seem to be so heavily regulated, that your investment is more a reflection of trust in the political class than the actual industry. 

The compute hardware industry makes sense to me, but I am already invested in non-Nvidia players and it is too close to Tech anyway. Novo Nordisk satisfied all those requirements, and I was planning on investing in it in January. Dragged my feet with it, and the train has passed.

I can take risks. I am already maxing out my 401ks with safe index funds and I am 30 with my responsibilities paid off. But, don't say Crypto or weed-stocks. I have already been burned on both.

* Battery capacity can now also be displayed in percentage.
* Charging stations in navigation can now be filtered by charging capacity.
* German language setting is now possible.
* Fewer disclaimers for apps.
* Improving the translation of functions in Dutch and other languages.
* DSM (driver monitoring system) can now have 3 different sensitivities: low/normal/high. High is what the standard was before the update.
* LSS (Lane support system): number of warnings significantly reduced to the most necessary and legally necessary. Less vibrations on the handlebars.
* IHB (intelligent high beam): Should be more precise, turn off the lights earlier to avoid annoying oncoming traffic. Should be better on highways too.
* X-Pilot ACC (adaptive cruise control): should work more ""smoothly"", less braking by parked cars at the edge of the street. Also improved logic in processing speed limit changes. Now automatically maintains speed when switching from LCC to ACC by steering movement.
* X-Pilot LCC (Lane Centering Control): Traffic light detection has now been added and appears at the top of the driver's dashboard. Optimization of acceleration and braking, so less slow acceleration and less sudden braking, even when drivers merge in front of you into your lane. Also less delay in corners and less chance of the system switching itself off.
* ALC (automatic lane shift assistant): Feedback has been improved and timing of acceleration after the lane change has taken place has been improved. ALC should be able to be the primary means of lane changing on the highway.
* APA (intelligent park assist): Has become better at parking in spaces.

post,17epxk7,,"Return to retro futurism & boxy designs, fad or here to stay?","So I’ve noticed that in recent years there have been quite a few mainstream (or not so mainstream) bold and outlandish designs that stand out amongst a sea of arguably bland 2010s modern designs, some of which look back at the concepts and styles of the 70s-80s (Hyundai vision 74, Nissan IDX, New Ford Bronco, New Lamborghini Countache, Challenger EV? and etc), while some others aims to challenge the current trend in automotive design (Hyundai Ioniq 5, Renault 5 EV, Honda E, Toyota IMV, Tesla Cybertruck and etc)

post,17j4q1u,,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"\*\* I have no position that is impacted by this post\*\*

Over the past few years, TSLA has performed nothing short of extraordinary. In the last five years, Tesla stock has almost 10x its value. The 857% total return of Tesla is substantially higher than all of its peers, including Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen

Despite strong growth, weakness has begun to present itself within the Wall Street prince in the past year. Tesla announced earlier in February 2023 that it would be cutting prices on the Model Y. This move surprised investors because, before the price cuts, Tesla appeared to be entirely supply-side constrained. However, investors noted that these cuts only impacted higher-end models that were outside the range of the mass vehicle market. However, in April, Tesla announced that it would be cutting prices on the Model 3. Elon Musk has previously alluded to a poor performing EV market in the wake of a higher interest rate environment. Economic data confirms this narrative as Automobile shipments have declined substantially in Q3’ 2023.

However, two factors that cannot be explained by an adverse economic environment are Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Cybertruck demand. FSD is Tesla’s end-to-end autonomous driving solution.

Tesla’s FSD is considered a level 2 autonomous driving solution. Level 2 systems require the driver to remain alert at all times with the anticipation that driver will have to take over in every circumstance. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly claimed that FSD would be finished by the end of the year for the past six years. Additionally, Musk has claimed that robo-taxis, completely automated taxi services would be available during the same timeframes. Tesla’s current FSD beta boasts some impressive technologies, including the ability to navigate through city streets without immediate intervention in many cases. However, level 3 seems to be uncertain  for the car company.",3215,True,1698591587.0,2023-10-29 15:59:47,354,543,TheMorningTraffic,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17j4q1u/we_should_start_worrying_about_tesla_tsla/,True,0.76,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

One out of every five cars sold in California is now powered by a battery, registration data released Wednesday by the California New Car Dealers Association shows.

In the first nine months of 2023, electric vehicles accounted for 21.5% of cars sold in California, a figure that’s more than doubled in the past two years. When combined with hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fuel-cell vehicles, the year-to-date figure is 35.4%.

California has long been a champion of electric cars, and Governor Gavin Newsom said he’ll phase out sales of new, gasoline-powered cars by 2035 as part of the state’s fight against climate change.

post,17mhp18,,Rental Mach-E vs Model Y,"My Model Y got keyed in an empty corner of Macy's parking lot last week and I while it is being repainted at the body shop, I used the opportunity to rent a Mach-E because I'm curious to check out another EV. I've been driving only Tesla EVs for the past 5 years and wanted to see how they stack up against the competition. The specific car I picked up is practically brand new, only 2400 miles on the clock.

**The good:**  
The seating position is higher than the Y and I like it. I also love the hood outline visible from the driver seat, it definitely shows Mustang heritage. In fact overall I love the exterior styling of the car, it's sleek, powerful and masculine. 

Interior was 50/50. I liked the feel of the steering wheel and the look of the dashboard, but the vertical screen with a single multifunctional knob just didn't do it for me. I mean it's nice to adjust the volume with it, but if I want to adjust the temperature, I first need to press the temp button on the screen before using the knob, so what did I really gain in terms of usability?

The seats are ok, firm, but not as plush as Y's. There's definitely more headroom inside but the trunk seems smaller. There's no meaningful subfloor trunk and I haven't looked under the hood, but I don't expect much space there either.

**The strange:**  
First off, my biggest concern are the brakes. What's up with the brakes? No matter how much I feather the pedal, the car behaves as if I stepped on it in panic. It is so jerky, I can't believe no one is complaining about it. Is this too, part of Mustang heritage?

Come to think of Mustang heritage, it seems the accelerator pedal too behaves like its controlling a V8. You stomp the pedal and don't feel the immediate kick in the neck like you do in the Y. Instead there's a gradual increase in acceleration, much like a gas engine behaves. I did not like it.

The infotainment could use a faster processor. Even my 2020 Y on the old Intel Atom feels faster than this.",3648,True,1698969597.0,2023-11-03 00:59:57,56,187,Comprehensive_Ant176,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/17mhp18/rental_mache_vs_model_y/,True,0.83,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

* Fain plans to use record contracts recently won with General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler-parent Stellantis to assist in the union’s embattled organizing efforts elsewhere. 
* The UAW has previously failed in organizing foreign-based automakers in the U.S., most recently at Volkswagen and Nissan Motor. 

DETROIT – United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain wants to expand the union’s battle from the Detroit automakers to Tesla, Toyota Motor and other non-unionized automakers operating in the U.S.

The outspoken leader plans to use record contracts recently won after contentious negotiations and U.S. labor strikes with General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler-parent Stellantis to assist in the union’s embattled organizing efforts elsewhere.

“We’ve created the threat of a good example, and now we’re going to build on it,” Fain said Thursday night when discussing Stellantis’ tentative agreement. “We just went on strike like we’ve never been on strike before and won a historic contract as a result. Now we’re going to organize like we’ve never organized before.”

Doing so would greatly assist the union’s bargaining efforts and membership, which has been nearly halved from roughly 700,000 members in 2001 to 383,000 at the beginning of this year. UAW membership peaked at 1.5 million in 1979.

Some things I noticed: I see why they call it Stealth, because the color changes pretty drastically depending on the light and angle. Walking up to it I thought the guy was mistaken and that he was showing me a black Model X. Up close, it looks like a darker version of the existing Model 3 grey.

post,17przt8,,Cathie Wood has a blunt warning about Tesla's stock over the coming months,"Ark Invest, a firm known for its bullish stance on Elon Musk and Tesla, believes that Tesla is well-positioned to dominate the self-driving cars and robotaxi fleet industry, which it anticipates could be worth up to $10 trillion by 2030. In April, Ark projected that Tesla's stock could reach $2,000 per share by 2027. Despite weak quarterly earnings and falling gross margins, Ark remains confident in Tesla's potential due to its focus on robotaxis.

However, Ark has been reducing its Tesla holdings in recent months, even as the stock experiences volatility. Their flagship Innovation ETF owned around 3.5 million Tesla shares in June, but by October 23, that number had fallen to 2.6 million shares, valued at $549.8 million. Despite this, Cathie Wood, Ark's CEO and investment lead, is still optimistic about their Tesla holdings.

Wood explained that Ark sells Tesla shares when the stock outperforms and reinvests in stocks with short-term concerns or significant underperformance relative to Tesla. They aim to increase their Tesla holdings during periods of stock underperformance.

Wood is also looking forward to the release of the Cybertruck in November, but she acknowledges potential near-term challenges and controversy, particularly related to profitability and scaling. Musk has indicated that the Cybertruck might not be profitable until scaling issues are addressed, which could take up to 18 months. Wood believes that the Cybertruck could be the next significant growth driver for Tesla.

post,17rhwac,,ExxonMobil passed Tesla as the most shorted stock last month. Here are the 10 names investors are betting against the most.,"ExxonMobil was the most shorted large-cap stock in the S&P 500 last month, according to HazelTree.  
Tesla and Apple followed the energy giant in the large-cap sector, according to data from HazelTree.  
Fund managers tracked by the firm also bet heavily against Rivian, SNAP, Ford, and AirBnB.

ExxonMobil Corp replaced Tesla as the most-shorted large-cap stock in the S&P 500, according to a report from HazelTree.  
  
Before last month, Elon Musk's car company had held the top spot as the most shorted stock for four consecutive months. When investors short a stock, they are betting that a company's share price will decline.   
  
HazelTree ranks short bets with a ""Crowdedness Score"" of one to 99, with the highest level representing shares shorted by the greatest percentage of funds tracked by HazleTree. The firm collects data on 12,000 global equities and over 700 funds.  
  
In the large-cap group, ExxonMobil and Tesla led the way with scores of 99 and 97, respectively, followed by Apple (94), Charter Communications (91), Broadcom (91), Rivian Automotive (86), US Bank Corp (83), SNAP (83), Ford (78), and AirBnB (78).   
  
The three most-shorted names in the mid-cap sector included SOFI Technologies (99), American Airlines (92), and EV maker Lucid (92).   
  
The report also highlighted the percentage of institutional investors' supply of a particular stock to be loaned to short sellers. In order to short a stock, an investor betting against a particular name must borrow the shares. It then sells them immediately. If the share price fall as expected, the short seller buys the shares back and returns them to the lender and pockets the difference in price.   
  
HazelTree said it tracks how ""hot"" a stock is in terms of supply and demand from short sellers.   
  
Rivian Automotive led the way in institutional supply utilization at 37%, well above ExxonMobil's 3.13% and Tesla's 2.67%.",2197,True,1699550156.0,2023-11-09 18:15:56,183,41,Guy_PCS,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17rhwac/exxonmobil_passed_tesla_as_the_most_shorted_stock/,True,0.84,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

post,17v936i,,When renting a Model 3 be prepared,"Wanted to share a quick experience with renting an EV from Budget. This past weekend I rented a Tesla Model 3 or “or similar” from Budget for a 1200 round trip that would be completed in 36 hours. 

I’ve owned a model S in the past and am familiar with the supercharging system. This trip would be a breeze with that network and the basic autopilot that helps with driving fatigue. I was very excited to try the 3 and even mapped out my whole route lying in bed the evening prior. 

When I l arrived to pickup the car they immediately inform me they do not have model 3’s but they have an Ioniq 5 or a Bolt. The rep said that particular location doesn’t have model 3’s at all. I was very naive as it never occurred to me that I might not get a model 3. I was immediately concerned about making this trip after reading so many negative stories about it the CCS network reliability and availability. I also was disappointed because I knew nothing about those cars driver assist capabilities. 

Anyways, I opted for the Ioniq with a 35% charge instead of a Corolla and decided to make it an adventure learning about non-supercharging trips. All in all, I loved the Ioniq and only had one bad fast charging experience at an EVgo location. I would happily rent that car again. 

Next time I will call ahead to see what the true availability is. 

TLDR: be prepared to get a CCS EV when renting a “Model 3 or Similar”",1411,False,1699987464.0,2023-11-14 19:44:24,36,31,FLduckHunter,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/17v936i/when_renting_a_model_3_be_prepared/,True,0.87,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1862zhv,,F150 Lightning - Thanksgiving Trip Report: Austin to Omaha,"**Pre-trip:**

After a successful Texas to [Colorado EV road trip](https://www.reddit.com/r/F150Lightning/comments/15wpuez/2500_mile_trip_report_in_my_lariat_er/) this summer, my wife and I decided to forgo our PHEV Volvo and take the Lightning up to Omaha for Thanksgiving. Although I was a little concerned with the lower temperatures up north, after creating a route in ABRP I was confident the truck would be able to make the trip. With our dog and an 8-month-old along for the ride, the goal of this trip was not to min-max charging and stop time but to simply arrive with all passengers happy and not stranded on the side of the road. We made more stops than if we didn’t have the baby with us and I typically charged the truck to at least 80% instead of leaving once I had the minimum charge needed to reach the next charger. Even with the extra charging time, the truck was usually ready to go before we were. This will probably change once our son is older, but the baby helps mask the Lightning’s longer charging time to 80%. In an ICE, the trip to Omaha from Austin is a 12-hour drive on paper without stops and about 13.5 hours with stops and traffic. In the Lightning, ABRP predicted 16 hours. We opted to break the trip into two days with a stop overnight in Oklahoma City each way.

I purchased a month of EA Pass+ for the discount pricing. It saved me a significant amount of money on my Colorado trip, and I highly recommend you sign up before any road trip you take. Although EA has a reputation of being unreliable/slow, that was not my experience on the last road trip, but I didn’t keep great records of each stop. I felt my experience was too subjective. This time around I kept very detailed records of each charge to better quantify the quality of the DCFC sessions.

* Cold tire pressure set to 47 psi

It charges fast, the screen provides a ton of information, it is quick, and it handles like a much smaller vehicle. That is where my positivity about this vehicle stops. The build quality that often gets discussed isn’t a big deal, but it feels extremely spartan in the interior. Everything being on the screen means that I am looking farther to my right whenever I need to check the map to see where I am going. That leads to me not paying enough attention to what is in front of me, which, when I was relying on autopilot caused emergency braking to activate on the highway. Autopilot is a substandard system in this day and age, especially with the multiple phantom braking instances I dealt with. Parking with vision only is garbage, you can’t trust it enough to rely on it, so I had to repark a few times (but this could also just be due to me not feeling comfortable).  ~~And for all the hype about the software, not being able to use android auto or apple carplay is stupid, since I would be googling where I am going to type the address into the Tesla Nav (A waste of time)~~ (You can apparently send it to the car through the app. My bad.) . Finally, I had the screen just shut down on me while driving back from the grocery store, which legitimately felt like an unsafe situation since I was driving pretty much blind in regards to my speed.

post,18hfht1,,Charging to 100% Daily,"So I’ve recently acquired a MX and was having mi ed feelings about the battery charging.

I charge at home at 11kwh and I am charging everyday to 80%. I usually do maybe 2miles a day? and on the weekend I like to go out. I don’t need the 80% range, however, coming from an ICE I value the peace of mind it gives me in case I ever do need it.

My question is, does it really hurt the battery to charge to 100% on a daily basis? I initially thought it did but then I read many comments Elon Musk says and many YT videos where they say that it doesn’t matter all that much. The batteries have been fool proved over the years and in Elon words “it’s more about the fact that the regen braking wont be energy efficient if you charge it” than the battery decay in itself.

Idk what to believe, and was wondering if any of you just ignored the recommended and how the battery has treated you.

I understand that you’ll be tempted to say “you dont need the range so don’t charge it” but that’s not really the matter at hand.

Thank you!

post,18j50vc,,TACC staying enabled when switching lanes is now only available with enhanced autopilot after the 2023.44.x update.,"I just got off a lengthy call with Tesla support.

Before I explain what I learned, I'll first explain what my experience has been so far with my 2021 Tesla Model 3 (60k miles). When I would have regular autopilot engaged  (a combination of autosteering and Traffic Aware Cruise Control (TACC)), if I was coming up on a slower car in front of me, I would put the turn signal on and then switch lanes. When I did this, autosteer would disengage but TACC would remain engaged and I would maintain my speed (relative to traffic as defined by how TACC works).

Ever since updating my Model 3 to 2023.44.1, when autopilot (both autosteering and TACC) is engaged, when I would begin switching lanes even with the turn signal on, both autosteering AND TACC would disengage. The first time it happened it was very jarring as the car suddenly and unexpectedly began decelerating (you know how Teslas do). I tried again a few minutes later and it did the same thing. That's when I realized something changed and throughout the remainder of my drive I made this mistake multiple times (habits are hard to break after all). I ended up trying to apply pressure to the gas peddle to avoid the jarring change in speed when TACC disengaged, but one of those times I applied too much pressure and autopilot was disabled for the remainder of my drive.

I tried to find a setting to change it back but was unsuccessful.

I called Tesla support today, and after a lengthy phone call with them I was informed that the ability to keep TACC engaged when manually switching lanes (even with the turn signal on) has been moved from regular autopilot to either enhanced autopilot or FSD.

I'm incredibly frustrated with this. Not only is this a feature on literally every other car in the world that uses some form of ACC, but it was something I understood was available when I purchased the car. To move it behind a paywall is unethical and really bad for customers.",2574,True,1702660436.0,2023-12-15 18:13:56,148,111,buckf1tches,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/18j50vc/tacc_staying_enabled_when_switching_lanes_is_now/,True,0.65,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Hopefully this confirms we wont lose accessibility to the roads we know work well for autopilot once car updates OTA.

**In accordance with a recent recall (campaign #23V-838 for US and #2023-657 for Canada), Tesla is making the following improvements to Autosteer:**

**– Improved visibility of driver monitoring warning alerts on the touchscreen by increasing the text size and moving the notifications to a more prominent position (Model 3 and Model Y only).**

**– Added option to activate Autopilot features with a single stalk depression, instead of two, to help simplify activation and disengagement.**

**– Increased the strictness of driver attentiveness requirements when using Autosteer and approaching traffic lights and stops signs off-highway.**

**– Introduced a Suspension Policy that will restrict Autosteer usage for one week if improper usage is detected. Improper usage is when you, or another driver of your vehicle, receive five “Forced Autopilot Disengagements.”**

**You are the driver. As the driver, you must be vigilant to the road, keep your hands on the wheel, and be ready to intervene to maintain safety.**",1385,False,1702676878.0,2023-12-15 22:47:58,146,230,Significant_Lock_541,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/18jb7rj/tesla_explains_new_autopilot_nag_forced_by_the/,True,0.91,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,18lyz17,,"Is Tesla the Ultimate Investment? Garry Breaks Down the Numbers, Growth, and Unveils the EV Game-Changer!","According to Garry, Investment advisor,Tesla ($TSLA) currently sits at $250 per share, trading at 58 times his estimated 2024 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $4.30. Garry's take on this? He believes it's a reasonable valuation, especially when considering the projected +28% increase in volume and an impressive +32% growth in EPS between now and 2030. This positions Tesla's Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio at 1.8x, notably lower than Apple's ($AAPL) 3.0x PEG.

Garry's outlook extends to global EV adoption, forecasting a rise from the current 13% to a substantial 60% by 2030, sporting a +24% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CGR). With faith in the Cybertruck and Tesla's $25,000 next-gen vehicle, Garry expects Tesla to boost its global EV market share from 16% to 20% by 2030. The outcome? Tesla's vehicle volumes surging from 1.8 million in 2023 to 2.4 million in 2024 and an impressive 10.2 million by 2030 (+28% CGR).

Factoring in aspects like auto gross margin expansion, contributions from energy, operating leverage, and cash reinvestment, Garry foresees Tesla's Adjusted EPS climbing from $3.20 in 2023 to $22 in 2030 (+32% CGR). Interestingly, Garry's projections don't include potential revenues from Full Self-Driving (FSD) licensing, robotaxi ventures, or other futuristic elements. However, they do consider FSD at a 15% global take rate and energy revenues rising by a factor of eight.

The central question, as per Garry's analysis, is whether a P/E ratio of 58x is too steep for the premier EV player, set to experience a +28% CGR in volume and +32% CGR in EPS. Garry challenges you to find another mega-cap stock with this level of growth and valuation, particularly with traditional automakers pulling back from their EV commitments. In his view, Tesla stands out as the primary investment opportunity in the evolving EV landscape.",1861,False,1702982362.0,2023-12-19 11:39:22,0,4,yogi2350,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18lyz17/is_tesla_the_ultimate_investment_garry_breaks/,True,0.24,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,18m9qyj,,Active Investing? Really?,"Not that I trust the first article I read but saw this on CNN today. Jack Manley, global market strategist at JPMorgan says that active investing is the way to go in 2024. I am curious to know what folks on this thread think.

Given below is a link to the article and a copy-paste of the relevant section. 

[https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/19/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/19/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html)

It’s all about active management   
  
A common theme across 2024 outlooks is that investors will do well to actively manage their portfolios next year. That’s a bit different than the ‘set it and forget it’ long-run investment advice that typically prevails among portfolio managers.  
  
Stocks and bonds have been unusually volatile this year, behaving in ways that aren’t consistent with economic expectations, wrote Jack Manley, global market strategist at JPMorgan. Given those “significant dislocations,” he said “simply owning the indices will not suffice.”  
  
That means an investment strategy that relies on broad market movements to generate returns, rather than on specific stock selection or other active management strategies, may fall short.  
  
“Investors need to take a more active approach to their portfolios. This is not a time to switch on the investing autopilot; it’s a time to take the controls,” wrote analysts at BlackRock. “It’s important to be deliberate in taking portfolio risk, in our view, and we expect to deploy more risk over the next year.”",1553,False,1703012980.0,2023-12-19 20:09:40,18,46,National-Ad8416,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18m9qyj/active_investing_really/,True,0.72,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

>  In a series of posts on X Monday night, Musk said that he would not want to grow Tesla to become a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics without a compensation plan that would give him ownership of around 25% of the company’s stock. That would be about double the roughly 13% stake he currently owns.

> “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned,” Musk wrote in a post on X. “Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.”

So the 2nd block he’s essentially threatening to spin off and make competition. 

But how does a public company address this? If they awarded him some GIGANTIC options, it would massively dilute existing shares. If they made another voting class of shares, x20,000 voting rights, they could just give a small pile of those, but what Board could transfer 12% voting interest in a public company based on some tweets? How would that be upholding their corporate responsibilities?

Is this some insider key to the sell off they’ve been experiencing? Cuz it’s frankly scary to me. And it’s scary because I think he might get it. Which does a lot to undercut the trust I have in the Board. I had been thinking of doing an option on them if they dropped to maybe 200-205. But this is just an ugly ultimatum that seems capable of vastly changing the value of the company.

* [BYD vs. Tesla market share.](https://i.imgur.com/oP0EnLO.png)


Chinese automaker expands its electric-vehicle lineup to more than 20 models in its push overseas and into higher price brackets

https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/a-lamborghini-style-ev-byd-goes-upmarket-to-outmaneuver-tesla-2b698578

HONG KONG— BYD overtook TSLA as the world’s top electric-vehicle seller by pumping out a range of affordable cars that gave Chinese drivers what they wanted: choice. 

Now it is moving into the luxury market as it prepares to take on the world.

BYD is releasing the cars under a different brand, Yangwang, marking a strategy shift from relying on lower-priced runarounds to producing less conventional vehicles that come with a hefty price tag. They include a $150,000 supercar that resembles a Lamborghini and an SUV that it says can rotate 360 degrees on the spot and float in water—features that turn heads in China’s cutthroat car market where buyers chase the latest smart technology.

Tesla, meanwhile, banks on continuing strong global demand mostly for its Model 3 and Model Y cars, which it refreshed last year. Tesla’s Cybertruck, its first release in years, isn’t available in China, though the automaker is planning to take the vehicle on a roadshow in the country.

In China, the world’s biggest EV market, Tesla’s market share has been shrinking: BYD now sells five cars to every one that the U.S. automaker does. BYD’s popularity has surged as it cranks out new and varied models at a rapid pace, growing its portfolio of electric vehicles to more than two dozen models, catering to almost every taste and budget. 

Backed by Warren Buffett, BYD has become so dominant in its home market that sales in the country enabled it to dethrone Elon Musk’s automaker as the bestselling global EV brand last quarter.",7079,True,1705963524.0,2024-01-22 23:45:24,0,19,absoluteunitvolcker2,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19d8szf/a_lamborghinistyle_ev_byd_goes_upmarket_to/,True,0.43,2024,both,search,False,False,0,
post,19f3fgb,,Why I’m Buying Rivian Stock,"Individual stock picking is for smart people who wear expensive suits. I’m not very smart and I hate wearing suits. I’m a boring index-fund guy. After all, history and math show us that the safe path to retirement is to simply plop money into a Vanguard fund every month. And that’s what I do with most of my money.  
  
But sometimes I see a juicy opportunity that fires me up. Occasionally, the timing of that opportunity is juuuuusst right and I put real money on the line. This is one of those situations and I'd love to hear what you think about it.  
  
I recently bought 4000 shares of Rivian stock (RIVN). My average cost is just over $16/share. That amounts to about $65,000. At the time of this writing, Rivian floats around $15.00/share and has a $14.5b market cap. I might buy another 1000 shares depending on the feedback that I get to this post.  
  
Anyway, here is why I believe Rivian will 3-4x in the next few years. 

# Point #1 – Big Picture - EV’s Will Win… Guaranteed.

Over the next 25 years, the auto industry is going to transition to electric vehicles because they will be cheaper to buy and operate. Hear me out:

1. Right now, batteries are the most expensive part of an EV. But EV battery tech is in its infancy. Incremental advances in batteries will increase the energy density and versatility of batteries year by year. More importantly, the industry will scale battery production by a few orders of magnitude. This will make EV batteries significantly cheaper to purchase on a per unit basis.
2. Government’s will continue to incentivize EV purchases with tax credits and other incentives for decades to come. In the long run, governments are definitely going to incentivize large scale energy creation by renewable means (which is getting cheaper and cheaper). On the other hand, western Governments are not going to subsidize or incentivize more coal power plants. That is just a fact.

post,1adgztd,,Tesla's Bull Case,"I see a lot of negative sentiment around Tesla and a true lack of understanding of what is to come.

I have been in Tesla since 2017 and this company has evolved in ways I never imagined.

I am more bullish today than I have ever been.

This is not investment advice and I honestly don't care whether you buy, sell, short, use options or anything else.

&#x200B;

People see Tesla's market cap of approximately $575 billion and immediately think it's overvalued.  They only make X amount, they only sold X amount, and Elon said/did this today.

&#x200B;

If it were as easy as looking at what a company currently is, or what they have done, everyone would be rich.  That is not how investing works.  There needs to be an understanding of what the future will look like.

&#x200B;

The future I see is one of abundance of labor, energy, time, etc.

&#x200B;

Tesla is set up to capitalize like no other company in history and become larger than anything anyone has ever built before.

&#x200B;

Lets focus on the now for a moment though.

&#x200B;

Things to understand, the company has the #1 selling vehicle in the world.  Not just #1 EV, it's the #1 car.

The TAM for there current lineup of vehicles is approaching it's cap with current interest rates and pricing.  The growth will be moderate compared to what people are use too from Tesla.

The current lineup of vehicles is printing money for them though, which is padding there balance sheet now with $29 billion in cash, about 5% of the market cap and the rest covering all of their current investments in the future and operations.

So for 2024 we can expect moderate volume growth and everyone already knows.

What will margins look like in 2024, nobody really knows, some people think it will continue to trend down, some people think it bottomed in Q3, when it bounced up slightly in Q4. Regardless I know that they will be printing more money and strengthening their balance sheet further while growing current projects.",5955,True,1706485835.0,2024-01-29 00:50:35,0,154,PricedIn18,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1adgztd/teslas_bull_case/,True,0.47,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

They do not let you view the car anywhere besides their parking lot that has direct light hitting the car making it virtually impossible to see any scratches. I took the car home and upon bringing it into my garage I noticed that there was severe scratches that were super long going all the way from the top of the hood to the bottom. It looks like someone took a towel that was left in a gravel to wipe my car off. I took pictures documented it and sent all the information to both sales and service in the app. When I told sales that I wanted to exchange it for a different one because this one had severe scratches they told me they had protocol and that I’d have to deal with service and service only. When I brought it in for service it was raining which again made it very difficult to see and show them the damage. They marked it in tape where I could remember where the damage was. When I got the car back it looked like someone was driving it real fast around corners because the sidewall of the tire had wear on it and it was not that way when I dropped it off. When I got it back I also noticed that on the top of the hood they cut the clear coat so deep with the buffing tool it became so uneven that it looks like the hood has a dent in it. Teslas come with orange peel clear coat and it is not smooth the way it comes from the factory. When they did the color correction they buffed and polished the areas that I had marked smooth. So every part of the car that was not touched has an orange peel like surface to it and the spots that were buffed are smooth. In the night or in the garage it is extremely visible.

*In an interview with journalist Don Lemon released in full on Monday morning, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO was asked about the new model of the Roadster—the car manufacturer's original design—which is due to be released next year. ""Look, I don't want to give away much more than what I've said publicly, except that the Roadster will be a collaboration between SpaceX and Tesla—so you can expect some rocket-y stuff there,"" he said.*  
*Asked by Lemon if it could be a flying car, Musk responded: ""Maybe,"" before waggling his head and laughing. ""It's not out of the question. I've got to reserve the cool stuff for when we actually unveil it, but it's going to be really cool; it's going to have some rocket technology in it.""*

*He added: ""I think, really, the only way to do something that's cooler than the Cybertruck is to combine SpaceX and Tesla technology to create something that's not ever really a car.""*

*""Then what would it be?"" Lemon asked.*

*""Something that's never existed before,"" Musk said, before agreeing with Lemon that it would have ""Jetsons vibes,"" a reference to the space age Hanna-Barbera cartoon which features flying cars.*

***The Context***:

*Tesla would not be the first company to attempt to build a commercially viable flying car. Several start-ups have been making use of advances in electric vehicle technology in recent years to design vehicles that hope to live up to science fiction.*

post,1bpy94c,,Xiaomi releases electric car $4K cheaper than Tesla's Model 3 as price wars heat up,"Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi said Thursday it will sell its first car for far less than Tesla’s Model 3, as price wars heat up in China’s fiercely competitive electric car market.

Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said the standard version of the SU7 will sell for 215,900 yuan ($30,408) in the country — a price he acknowledged would mean the company was selling each car at a loss.

Tesla’s Model 3 starts at 245,900 yuan in China.

Lei claimed the standard version of the SU7 beat the Model 3 on more than 90% of its specifications, except on two aspects that he said it might take Xiaomi at least three to five years to catch up with Tesla on. He also said the SU7 had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus the Model 3′s 606 kilometers. The company said orders had exceeded 50,000 cars in the 27 minutes since sales started at 10 p.m. Beijing time Thursday.

Deliveries are set to start by the end of April, Lei said. Lei also claimed that Xiaomi’s car factory, for which all “key” steps are fully automated, can produce an SU7 every 76 seconds. It was not immediately clear whether the factory was fully operational.

Earlier this week, the Xiaomi CEO said on social media the SU7 would be the best sedan “under 500,000 yuan” ($69,328).

The car is entering a fiercely competitive market in China, where companies are launching a slew of new models and cutting prices in order to survive. Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has partnered with traditional automakers, most notably launching the Aito brand whose vehicles are often on display in Huawei smartphone showrooms.

Tesla’s Model 3 is the best-selling new energy sedan in China that has a driving range of at least 600 kilometers (372 miles) and costs less than 500,000 yuan, according to data from industry website Autohome.

BYD’s Han sedan starts at 169,800 yuan, according to Autohome.

post,1bryqpo,,Frustrated with the amount of scammers in the financial space,"Hello,

It feels like almost everyone in the financial sector is a scammer sometimes. I know this isn't strictly true, but man the scammers are everywhere.

I was doing research on Sam Bankman Fried in the past week, and even when I searched for terms like ""financial scam"" or ""financial fraud"" or whatever the exact terms I used, I got results back from known scammers like Warrior Trading, who was going to warm me of frauds!

I clicked on a Youtube video from 60 minutes on Sam Bankman Fried, and I said to myself, 60 minutes won't scam me. And then Michael Lewis comes on and starts shilling for SBF. What the heck??

Didn't Michael Lewis write a book about toxic assets, which were then sold to investors as safe and AAA and then leveraged to the hilt, from various Wall St. banks and credit ratings agencies, in a combination of folly/stupidity and greed/fraud? The main question often was what percentage was stupidity and what percentage was scamming the public. That was The Big Short.

Here Lewis takes the side of someone who embezzled billions, freerolled the bezzle with an insane risky bet, recommended lots of shitcoins to unsuspecting investors, encouraged them to use even more risks with derivative bets on these shitcoins, and then outright stole what remained from investors to prop up his failing crypto hedge fund Alameda Research, which has lost billions in bad trades.

CNBC and Bloomberg are always hyping various scams. Elon Musk posts he will make a flying car at Tesla a few years ago, the stock jumps double digits on the news, and CNBC hypes it up. Then invite Michael Saylor to pump his crypto scheme even though he was a scammer way back from the dot com bubble. His firm had major accounting ""issues"" and somehow he is still not only CEO of his stupid company, but invited to pump it while he is dumping shares and has been selling consistently for the past six months or so.",2263,True,1711849829.0,2024-03-31 03:50:29,4,29,I_feel_abandoned,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1bryqpo/frustrated_with_the_amount_of_scammers_in_the/,True,0.56,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1btycxe,,"Tesla reports 386,810 deliveries in the first quarter of 2024, produced 433,371 vehicles ","Tesla just published its first-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report for 2024. Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q1 2024: 386,810
Total production Q1 2024: 433,371

Tesla doesn’t break out sales of its vehicles by model but reported that it produced 412,376 Model 3/Y cars and delivered 369,783 of those cars. It produced 20,995 of its other models and delivered 17,027.

In the same period last year, the electric automaker reported 422,875 deliveries and production of 440,808 vehicles. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla reported 484,507 deliveries and production of 494,989 vehicles.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company’s shareholder communications.

According to a mean of 11 estimates compiled by FactSet, analysts were expecting deliveries of around 457,000 for the period ending March 31. Estimates ranged from a high of 511,000 deliveries to a low of 414,000 for the first quarter, with estimates updated in March ranging from 414,000 to 469,000 deliveries.

Independent auto industry researcher Troy Teslike, whose work is closely followed by Tesla fans, had expected deliveries to come in around 409,000.

Tesla’s head of investor relations Martin Viecha sent around a company-compiled consensus based on 30 analysts’ estimates over the weekend to select investors. The consensus, which was viewed by CNBC, said analysts were expecting a mean of 443,027 deliveries and a median of 431,125 deliveries for the quarter.

Tesla faced numerous challenges in the first quarter.

Houthi militia attacks on shippers in the Red Sea disrupted Tesla’s component supply and temporarily suspended production at its German factory outside of Berlin in January. In March, environmental activists set fire to infrastructure near that same factory, depriving Tesla of sufficient operation power and again causing a pause in production.",3273,True,1712063430.0,2024-04-02 15:10:30,1128,688,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1btycxe/tesla_reports_386810_deliveries_in_the_first/,True,0.9,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1bwtyff,,Elon Musk says Tesla will unveil its robotaxi on Aug. 8; shares pop,"Tesla will reveal its robotaxi product on Aug. 8, CEO Elon Musk said in a social media post on X.

Musk has spoken about the robotaxi project for years, and it could represent a major new business for the carmaker as investors grow wary of the company during a period of slowing growth.

Tesla shares rose over 3% in extended trading after Musk’s tweet.

Musk shared the release date on Friday after Reuters reported that plans for Tesla’s highly anticipated low-cost car model had been scrapped. Musk accused Reuters of “lying.”

Tesla’s robotaxi project, according to Musk’s past remarks, would allow Tesla vehicles to use self-driving technology to autonomously pick up riders for fares. In 2019, Musk said that he expected to have over 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020. Author Walter Isaacson also mentioned the robotaxi project in his biography of Musk, published in 2022.

Currently, Tesla offers advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS,) including its Autopilot option, as well as a premium Full Self-Driving “FSD” option, which costs $199 per month for subscribers. However, Teslas currently cannot operate without human intervention.

There is significant competition in the market for taxi services that use self-driving cars.

Alphabet’s autonomous vehicle unit Waymo operates driverless ride-hailing services in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and is now ramping up in Tesla’s home base of Austin, Texas.

GM’s Cruise service previously offered self-driving car services in San Francisco before being wound down under regulatory scrutiny after an accident. Since the incident, Cruise’s robotaxi fleet has been grounded, local and federal governments have launched their own investigations and Cruise leadership has been gutted.

A trapped accelerator pedal could cause the vehicle to accelerate unintentionally, increasing the risk of a crash, the auto safety regulator said in a [notice, opens new tab](https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCAK-24V276-5059.pdf).

Tesla started deliveries of its Cybertruck electric pickup truck late last year, after a two-year delay due to production problems and battery-supply constraints.

The EV maker will replace or repair the accelerator pedal assembly at no charge and owners will be notified through letters mailed to them in June, the NHTSA said.

In the first quarter of 2024 Tesla had three recalls affecting about 2.4 million vehicles, according to a report by recall management firm BizzyCar.

However, most issues related to Tesla recalls are usually resolved through over-the-air software updates.

In February, Tesla [recalled](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recall-over-2-mln-vehicles-us-nhtsa-2024-02-02/) about 2.2 million vehicles in the United States due to an incorrect font size on warning lights and U.S. safety regulators [upgraded their probe](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recall-over-2-mln-vehicles-us-nhtsa-2024-02-02/) into the company's vehicles over power steering loss to the status of an engineering analysis.

If you're not familiar, there is a grocery store chain in Florida. Publix Supermarkets. Even if you're not from the South, there is a chance you're familiar with the chain. It's known for its clean stores, exceptional service, brand recognition, and for treating its customers with dignity. The business is well over fifty years old. Many of their long-time employees, 20-30 years, have the status of ""Publix Millionaires."" This is due to the internal stock program within the company.

I'm curious as to why more companies don't use this model.  If a small supermarket chain can do it, why can't more companies (tech, financial firms, etc) do it? I'm not saying it's the best model, but why don't why celebrate companies like Publix, and encourage a culture that does this? To think that a little Southern supermarket has less turnover and more employee/customer/market trust than a billion-dollar company like Tesla makes me chuckle. Hell, Publix might last longer than Tesla!

At the same time, can someone enlighten me on what makes Publix a successful business from a  development perspective? Where is could improve? Honestly, I only have a general (mostly lament) understanding of business development.

post,1cbe0bw,,"Tesla cutting around 2,700 jobs in Austin as part of broad restructuring","Tesla is eliminating around 12% of its workforce at a factory in Austin, Texas, as part of a broader restructuring the company announced last week.

According to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act letter on Tuesday, the layoffs affect 2,688 employees at the facility in Travis County. In 2021, Tesla CEO Elon Musk moved the company’s corporate headquarters to Austin from Palo Alto, California.

Musk said in an internal memo last week that Tesla was cutting more than 10% of its global headcount as the electric vehicle maker reckons with flagging sales and increased competition. He did not say which departments or locations would be most affected.

“As we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity,” he wrote. A subsequent WARN notice filed in New York indicated that 285 positions were being eliminated at a factory in Buffalo.

Tesla employed 140,473 people as of December, according to filings.

Tesla officially opened its Texas EV and battery factory in April 2022, with a “cyber rodeo” party. The company now manufactures some of its Model Y crossover utility vehicles in Austin, and has started to build its Cybertruck there.

Musk later called the Austin factory, and another assembly plant in Germany, “gigantic money furnaces,” in an interview with Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, a fan club that promotes Tesla vehicles.

According to filings with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, Tesla was planning to spend upward of $770 million last year on the construction of expanded facilities in Austin, including for battery cell testing and manufacturing, cathode and drive unit manufacturing, plus a die shop, among other things.

post,1cc3dtf,,INTC vs TSLA - Trying to understand market sentiment.,"Forgive my naive question but I'm really trying to wrap my head around these two stocks (stockholder in both).  
  
INTC - Semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse. Still has a majority in data center and pc CPU space. I do agree that they fell behind TSMC and Samsung in terms of process leadership and don't have a serious product offering in the GPU space that can take on Nvidia H100 (Gaudi 3 seems like a good competitor). And Pat Gelsinger is trying hard to bring it back on track. They have 18A process node on track to hit HVM production in 2025(?), US government is funding their fab expansion plans, Foundry is slowly winning customer, and for the next few years, compute is the new oil. Everything seems to be inline for INTC to go up like AMD and NVDA. But no, it always drops.  
  
TSLA - Eccentric owner who is more interested in peddling conspiracy theories on X that he bought on a whim. FSD was a long lost pipe dream, which never seems to be working fine , and current version has its own kinks. EV is becoming an extremely competitive market everyday with new entrants and an ongoing price war. Cybertruck was late by 2-3(?) years and has. IDK if Roadster will ever happen in this decade, Tesla Semi is another thing which seemed nice on paper but idk if it's ever really gonna happen. News reports claimed that Musk cancelled Model2. But again claims TSLA is gonna make a cheaper model ( which would probably cannibalize Model 3 and Model Y sales; and lets be honest - no one knows if and when that's actually coming on the roads).  
  
Can anyone explain why is the market so bullish about TSLA even after reporting lower EPS, 9% drop in revenue, and is ready to eat his words about the cheaper model like its God's truth itself, while INTC drops like a rock on the first opportunity, even though Semiconductors are the bedrock of AI and EV growth.",1873,False,1713977925.0,2024-04-24 18:58:45,85,100,EuclidianEigenvalue,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cc3dtf/intc_vs_tsla_trying_to_understand_market_sentiment/,True,0.8,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1ce2p7z,,Tesla Autopilot has 'critical safety gap' linked to hundreds of collisions: NHTSA,"Federal authorities say a “critical safety gap” in Tesla’s Autopilot system contributed to at least 467 collisions, 13 resulting in fatalities and “many others” resulting in serious injuries.

The findings come from a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration analysis of 956 crashes in which Tesla Autopilot was thought to have been in use. The results of the nearly three-year investigation were published Friday.

Tesla’s Autopilot design has “led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes,” the NHTSA report said. The system did not “sufficiently ensure driver attention and appropriate use.”

NHTSA’s filing pointed to a “weak driver engagement system,” and Autopilot that stays switched on even when a driver isn’t paying adequate attention to the road or the driving task. The driver engagement system includes various prompts, including “nags” or chimes, that tell drivers to pay attention and keep their hands on the wheel, as well as in-cabin cameras that can detect when a driver is not looking at the road. 

The agency also said it was opening a new probe into the effectiveness of a software update Tesla previously issued as part of a recall in December. That update was meant to fix Autopilot defects that NHTSA identified as part of this same investigation.

The voluntary recall via an over-the-air software update covered 2 million Tesla vehicles in the U.S., and was supposed to specifically improve driver monitoring systems in Teslas equipped with Autopilot.

NHTSA suggested in its report Friday that the software update was probably inadequate, since more crashes linked to Autopilot continue to be reported.

In one recent example, a Tesla driver in Snohomish County, Washington, struck and killed a motorcyclist on April 19, according to records obtained by CNBC and NBC News. The driver told police he was using Autopilot at the time of the collision.",5049,True,1714182190.0,2024-04-27 03:43:10,439,154,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ce2p7z/tesla_autopilot_has_critical_safety_gap_linked_to/,True,0.84,2024,both,search,False,False,0,
post,1cfwypc,,Tesla jumps 10% in premarket trade after passing key hurdle to roll out full self-driving in China,"Shares of Tesla rose sharply in U.S. premarket trading on Monday after the electric car maker passes a significant milestone to roll out its full self-driving technology in China.

The company’s share price spiked more than 10% just after 7:30 a.m. ET, as investors reacted to news surrounding Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s visit to China.

Tesla on Sunday said that local Chinese authorities removed restrictions on its cars after passing the country’s data security requirements.

The move raised expectations that Tesla’s driver-assistance software Full Self Driving (FSD) would soon be available in the country, which is the largest market for electric vehicles.

While Tesla’s electric cars are some of the most popular vehicles in China, they have reportedly been banned from some government-related properties due to data security concerns.

Separately, the Biden administration earlier this year announced a probe into whether imported cars from China pose national security risks due to their ability to potentially collect sensitive data.

FSD is an upgrade to Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistant. Tesla has offered its FSD technology in China for years, but with a restricted feature set that limits it to operations, such as automated lane changing.

Data security concerns have been a key obstacle preventing Tesla from achieving a full rollout of the system in China.

Tesla also reportedly scored a deal with Baidu that would give Musk’s firm access to the Chinese internet giant’s mapping and navigation technology for Tesla’s FSD feature.

The agreement would allow Tesla to tap into Baidu’s mapping service license, which is a requirement for intelligence driving systems to operate on public roads in China, Reuters reported, citing two anonymous sources familiar with the matter.

CNBC was unable to independently verify the report. Tesla and Baidu were not immediately available for comment.",2828,True,1714390860.0,2024-04-29 13:41:00,710,409,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cfwypc/tesla_jumps_10_in_premarket_trade_after_passing/,True,0.89,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1cnicsr,,NIO's Strategic Charge in the Global EV Market,"Investing in NIO, despite its current operational losses and significant debt levels, can be considered a forward-looking strategy, particularly for those who are bullish on the future of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable technologies. 

NIO's debt is largely a reflection of its aggressive investment in research and development, infrastructure, and expanding production capabilities. These investments are critical for gaining a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving EV market. By financing growth and innovation, NIO is positioning itself to capture a significant share of the global EV market, which is expected to grow substantially.  NIO is not just focusing on the Chinese market but is also eyeing expansion into Europe and potentially other international markets, giving it more growth opportunities.

The automotive industry is undergoing a significant transformation, moving away from fossil fuels to electric and hybrid vehicles. This shift is expected to continue due to the decreasing cost of batteries, improved EV infrastructure, and increasing societal awareness about climate change.

However the journey to other countries such as America does not come without challenges, especially with the  giant EV manufacturer Tesla running the show. Tesla has a strong brand presence in the U.S., recognized for pioneering the electric car industry and backed by high-profile CEO Elon Musk. Tesla's brand is associated with innovation, quality, and sustainability, aspects that resonate well with American consumers. NIO, while a recognized brand in China and some parts of Europe, would need marketing efforts to establish similar recognition in the U.S.  For NIO to compete effectively, it will need to differentiate its vehicles through unique features, possibly focusing on its innovative Battery as a Service (BaaS) model, advanced autonomous driving capabilities, and superior interior luxury, which are some of NIO's strong suits.",3003,True,1715209810.0,2024-05-09 01:10:10,0,1,YoungChopOnDaBeat,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1cnicsr/nios_strategic_charge_in_the_global_ev_market/,True,0.44,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1d7wmef,,Elon Musk ordered Nvidia to ship AI chips reserved for Tesla to X and xAI ,"Elon Musk claims he can grow Tesla into “a leader in AI & robotics,” an ambition that he’s said will require a lot of pricey processors from Nvidia to build up its infrastructure.

On Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call in April, Musk said the electric vehicle company will increase the number of active H100s — Nvidia’s flagship artificial intelligence chip — from 35,000 to 85,000 by the end of this year. He also wrote in a post on X a few days later that Tesla would spend $10 billion this year “in combined training and inference AI.”

But emails written by Nvidia senior staff and widely shared inside the company suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla’s procurement to shareholders. Correspondence from Nvidia staffers also indicates that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter.

By ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla, Musk pushed back the automaker’s receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.

“Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,” an Nvidia memo from December said. “In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.”

A more recent Nvidia email, from late April, said Musk’s comment on the first-quarter Tesla call “conflicts with bookings” and that his April post on X about $10 billion in AI spending also “conflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts.” The email referenced news about Tesla’s ongoing, drastic layoffs and warned that headcount reductions could cause further delays with an “H100 project” at Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory.",10038,True,1717506180.0,2024-06-04 15:03:00,577,219,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1d7wmef/elon_musk_ordered_nvidia_to_ship_ai_chips/,True,0.91,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

“Elon is not a typical executive, and Tesla is not a typical company,” Denholm writes in a [letter to shareholders filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000110465924068792/tm2413800d20_defa14a.htm). “So, the typical way in which companies compensate key executives is not going to drive results for Tesla. Motivating someone like Elon requires something different.”

The vote to approve the $56 billion pay package, which would make Musk the most highly compensated chief executive in modern history, is “not about the money,” Denholm insists. “We all know Elon is one of the wealthiest people on the planet, and he would remain so even if Tesla were to renege on the commitment we made in 2018.”

Ok...so if it's not about the money, then it's about what, exactly? Seems like it is 100% about the money. Why would shareholders vote to give this guy exponentially more than the total profit Tesla has ever made?

post,1dtlvh3,,"Tesla reports 443,956 deliveries in second quarter, a 4.8% decrease from last year ","Tesla just posted its second-quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers for 2024.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q2 2024: 443,956 vehicles

Total production Q2 2024: 410,831 vehicles

Tesla’s numbers beat Wall Street estimates. Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439,000 in the three months ending June 30, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet Street Account. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter was down 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier.

Troy Teslike, an independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans, predicted deliveries of 423,000 for the quarter.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the electric vehicle maker. Tesla groups deliveries into two categories — Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and all other vehicles — but doesn’t report numbers for individual models or specific regions.

Tesla’s current lineup includes its popular Model Y crossover utility vehicles, Model 3 sedans and the new Cybertruck pickups, as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan.

In April, Tesla reported a drop of 8.5% in first-quarter deliveries to 386,810, the first annual decline since 2020. Weeks later the company reported 13% decline in year-over-year revenue for the quarter, “primarily due to lower average selling price.”

Sluggish sales were in part the result of temporary factory shut downs initiated in response to an alleged arson attack at Tesla’s factory in Germany, as well as shipping delays following Red Sea conflicts, Tesla said.

But the sales drop also correlated with Tesla’s aging lineup of vehicles, increased competition from other EV makers especially in China, and brand erosion that one recent survey attributed partly to CEO Elon Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.”

Tesla shares are down 16% in 2024 even after rallying 6% on Monday.

post,1dulktf,,Tesla Set for a New Bull Run as Deliveries Turn Around and Energy Storage Powers the AI Era,"Whenever investors are disappointed with Tesla, Elon Musk surprises short sellers with a big move. On Tuesday, Tesla posted stronger-than-expected Q2 deliveries, hinting at a turning point for weak demand, with an upside in Q3 deliveries. Additionally, energy storage deployments doubled quarter-over-quarter, potentially helping to meet the vast electricity demand that comes with AI. These factors are enough to bring in a substantial influx of Tesla bulls.

Thanks to these developments, Tesla surged over 10% on Tuesday, with its market value reaching $737.5 billion, maintaining a six-day rally, and breaking another resistance level, which is always a bullish sign. From April's low, Tesla shares are now up 67%.

**Q2 Deliveries Slightly Exceed Expectations Amid Record June Deliveries from Chinese EV Makers, Zero-Interest Car Purchases Expected to Drive Crazy Q3 Demand**

According to Tesla's delivery data released on Tuesday, the company delivered 440,000 new vehicles in Q2, down 4.8% year-over-year but up 15% quarter-over-quarter, and better than the market's expectation of 439,300 vehicles. The total production in Q2 was about 411,000 cars, resulting in a delivery-production gap of 33,000 cars, compared to -46,000 cars in the previous quarter (where more cars were produced, leading to some inventory remaining). Tesla noted that sales in the second quarter were affected by the temporary shutdown of German factories and the Red Sea conflict, which also means there is upward potential on the demand side or perhaps short-term supply struggles to meet demand, which is obviously more exciting than excess supply.

Considering that Chinese EV makers such as NIO, ZEEKR, and Leapmotor have all reported record deliveries in June, this implies a significant recovery in demand for Tesla. The company also launched a major campaign on Monday, introducing five-year zero interest financing for Model 3/Y and other preferential policies.",3784,True,1720031433.0,2024-07-03 20:30:33,0,7,BobbyFuckkingAxelrod,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1dulktf/tesla_set_for_a_new_bull_run_as_deliveries_turn/,True,0.25,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1er95xp,,Let’s Add an Electric Sunshade to Our Teslas – and Maybe Even More!,"**Hi Tesla Team and Fellow Tesla Owners,**

This summer, I had an amazing road trip through the south of Italy with my Tesla Model Y LR 2022. But one thing stood out – the intense sun, especially in 40°C (104°F) heat, made the cabin heat up quickly. Without any shading, the sun’s rays directly hit the inside of the car, making the AC work harder and draining the battery faster.

**So, here’s a straightforward idea**: What if Tesla included a simple, electric sunshade that we could control with the touch of a button? This would block out the sun when needed, keep the car cooler, and make the AC work less, which would save battery and extend our range. This would prevent us from having to install manual panels ourselves that are inconvenient and don't look nice.

**But here’s where it could get even better**: Alternatively imagine if Tesla would come up with a smart glass technology that tints the roof on demand or even add solar panels to help recharge the battery a bit while driving or parked in the sun. These upgrades could be especially cool if they prove effective, at least to add some extra miles of range.

**Why it matters**: This feature would be great for new Teslas, and it could also be designed to retrofit older models, so everyone benefits. It’s a simple but powerful way to make our cars even more efficient and comfortable.

**Let’s get the word out**: I’ve noticed that tweeting to Elon Musk might not always get results if you don’t have a big following. But maybe we can start a discussion on Reddit and get the Tesla community behind this idea. If you think this would be a great addition to our cars, let’s share it and see what we can achieve together! Thank you! 😉 ",1704,False,1723558964.0,2024-08-13 16:22:44,0,22,fscheps,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1er95xp/lets_add_an_electric_sunshade_to_our_teslas_and/,True,0.44,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

Hyundai should be the first I hear, and an electric GV80 would be high on my list, but does it matter if the NACS standard is built in or if an adapter is used? Would it really affect charging speeds or access to either ccs or NACS chargers all that much?

It seems like Tesla is running itself straight towards a DoJ anti-competitive practices lawsuit anyway, so maybe I shouldn’t care.

post,1f785wr,,Thoughts on skill-based hiring,"What’s your take on the latest hiring trend that’s picking up steam with companies like Google, IBM, Tesla, and even the White House?  

I’ve got mixed feelings. On one hand, dropping the degree requirement opens the talent pool, which is great for filling skill gaps fast. But there are some concerns. Passing a technical test doesn’t always mean someone is ready to handle the complexities of managing digital infrastructure or securing user data. 

We should take a moment to think about what a degree actually represents. It’s not just about having technical skills; it also shows that someone can commit to long-term goals, tackle complex tasks, work well in teams, and bring critical thinking, problem-solving, and leadership skills to the table. 

Skill-based hiring might be a great fit for entry-level roles or hands-on jobs, but for more complex projects, I think it’s still important to consider academic background. A balanced approach seems ideal—one that combines technical assessments with evaluations of soft skills and how someone might perform under pressure in real-world situations. 

What do you all think? Is skill-based hiring the future, or do we still need to value the traditional routes? ",1215,False,1725287438.0,2024-09-02 16:30:38,2,6,NickBaca-Storni,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1f785wr/thoughts_on_skillbased_hiring/,True,0.75,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1fcyze8,,How To Get Money For A Business,"I've seen a lot of posts about people wanting money to start or grow a business but not knowing how.

These are some of the easiest ways to get money to start a business:

1. **Presales.** Preselling subscriptions or even physical products will allow you to fund your business for $0 upfront. Tesla used presales on the Cybertruck to get a free $25 million dollar loan from their customers. You can do the same thing on a smaller scale.
2. **Business credit.** If you have a 700 credit score and an LLC that's at least 3 months old, you can $100k+ in business credit. Right now there are certain credit products that literally offer 0% interest for the first 12-18 months. 
3. **Friends and family.** If you truly have a compelling idea, raising money from friends and family is a viable option most people are afraid of. This one does come with some drawbacks (especially if you fail) but it can also provide strong motivation not to fail
4. **SBA loans.** These can be a little tough to get and typically take at least 3 months to close, but they can have incredibly good interest rates if you get approved.
5. **Seller finance.** If you're buying an existing business, many businesses will offer some form of seller finance simply to get the deal done. 
6. **Crowdfunding.** Using crowdfunding platforms can be a great way to fund a new business or get money for an existing business without the direct pressure of asking friends and family. It does require some marketing skills to get any real traction though. 
7. **Venture Capital / Angel Investors.** There are several platforms that will allow you to raise money through VC or angel investors. 

There are plenty of reasons not to start or grow a business but don't let lack of funding be one of them. 

Many businesses struggle or fail simply because the business owners don't know there are so many options out there.

post,1fuftc7,,"Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter","Tesla posted its third-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on Wednesday. The stock fell about 2% in premarket trading after the report.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890

Total production Q3 2024: 469,796

Analysts were expecting deliveries of 463,310 in the period ending Sept. 30, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount.

Deliveries are not defined in Tesla’s financial disclosures, but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. It’s one of the most closely-watched metrics on Wall Street.

In the year-ago period, Tesla reported 435,059 deliveries and production of 430,488 EVs. Last quarter, the company reported 443,956 deliveries, and production of 410,831 vehicles.

Tesla is facing increased competitive pressure, especially in China, from companies like BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers, including Li Auto and Nio.

In the U.S., EV competitors like Rivian are maturing, while legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification.

GM this week reported a roughly 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. Still, its electric business is tiny compared to Tesla’s, with just 32,100 units sold in the latest period, accounting for 4.9% of the company’s total sales.

Ford plans to report results on Wednesday.

Tesla hasn’t issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries, but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle, the angular stainless steel Cybertruck, to their lineup.

The company also said on Wednesday that it deployed 6.9 GWh of energy storage products in the quarter.

Shares of Tesla climbed 32% in the third quarter, erasing their loss for the year in the process. The stock is now up almost 4% in 2024, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 19%.",3078,True,1727874606.0,2024-10-02 15:10:06,424,243,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fuftc7/tesla_stock_slips_after_it_reports_462890_total/,True,0.94,2024,both,search,False,False,0,
post,1fwhdpi,,When will we see more EV sedans or coupe's?,"Lately I've noticed that almost all of the legacy auto makers are only unveiling crossovers/big SUVs for EVs. And even for the few sedans coming out, they have less range and horsepower than the model 3, but also cost more than the Model 3. I personally just don't feel very excited for new EVs, since they're all just copy and paste crossovers. Most of them also just copy Tesla's interior with limited buttons. The new Model 3 looks cool with its long range and high amount of horsepower, but I don't like it because it doesn't have buttons and I can't stand the fact that they got rid of the turn stalks. I also don't like Elon Musk. I really want to see some cool sporty EVs with lots of horsepower, having buttons for everything in the interior, good range and be reasonably priced. The new model 3 hits everything right except for the lack of buttons, turn stalk, and the fact that its a smartphone on wheels.

post,1fyyqdr,,"Test Drove ~10 EVs at a local event, my thoughts on the winners and losers","Recently, my area had an event to promote electric driving, with a bunch of EVs being available for test drives. Naturally I decided to go and try out some. I'm a I suppose soft car enthusiast; I love cars, I love driving, but I don't need a manual diesel with cloth seats and roll down windows to enjoy myself. So these reviews will be from that perspective, and trying to view it from the target audience

Because this got so popular in r/electricvehicles, I decided to repost it here, with a few corrections/additions. Any brand you don't see here I either didn't drive at the event (VW ID.4) or wasn't there (Kia EV6, Rivian, etc). I also accidentally cut off a car while editting, so you guys get an extra review for no fee 

If you want to fight in the comments about how my takes are trash quickly, here is a tdlr:

Most Suprising (positive): Ford F150 Lightning

Most Suprising (negative): Hyundai Ioniq 5

Best Value: Tesla Model 3 Standard Range (Highland)

Worst Value: Tesla Model Y Standard Range

With that out of the way, let's get started, in no particular order:

1: Cadillac Lyriq: 7/10

This car feels like a classic Cadillac, for good and for ill. Everything about it is smooth, and it feels refined while putting its power down, not powerful but enough for what it is. Nothing particularly special in terms of charging or range, but I feel it fits the Cadillac clientel very well; lot's of room in the back and up front, touchscreen and cameras were good. UI was also very good, if a bit menu filled

It's downsides are, well, classically Cadillac. The interior was *okay*. The sound system was *okay*. But given the car's sticker said it was nearly *$91,000 CAD before tax* it shouldn't be *okay*. It should be at the tier of the Germans, and it still just... isn't. I wouldn't be as offended if it was significantly less pricey than something like the new Q6 or EQE SUV, but it isn't.",13662,True,1728390976.0,2024-10-08 14:36:16,715,154,stav_and_nick,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1fyyqdr/test_drove_10_evs_at_a_local_event_my_thoughts_on/,True,0.93,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1g4cmvs,,"""frontier tech"" portfolio ","hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things:

* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.
* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.
* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.
* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.

post,1g963qj,,Musk's Political Alignment Helping EVs in the US?,"As I thought about the title, I considered several times abandoning the topic altogether.

For a moment, put aside any feelings you have for Elon Musk and join me on this thought experiment.  With Elon wooing conservatives (and even far right EV haters) with his recent comments and appearances, is this putting pressure on other auto manufacturers in the US to ramp up production and/or discount EVs in order to be more competitive in the marketplace?

Case in point:  Ford has recently offered up to $22.5k to dealers to move their F150 Lightning inventory.  Is this directly related to the recent embrace of ~50% of Americans that may not have ever considered thinking about an EV being in their family name in their, or their descendants', lifetimes?

It seemed like a short while ago, EVs were doomed (yes that's FUD, but the aforementioned Ford even decided to slow their production of the F150 Lightning), but it seems like things might be heating up very quickly (potentially despite the election outcome).

What say you?

EDIT: Regarding supply and demand arguments against lowering prices if demand is rising, Ford still is producing Lightnings so it wants to move existing production in order to realize sales on its newest deliveries.  What better way to have their consumers advertise to their friends than to have them gush about a fantastic deal?

post,1gbcgse,,Tesla stock has best day in over a decade on Musk's 2025 growth projection,"Tesla shares soared 22% to close at $260.48 on Thursday, the stock’s best day since 2013, following the company’s better-than-expected earnings report.

The company late Wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which came in just under analysts’ expectations of $25.37 billion, but was up 8% compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.

“We expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in Tesla shares Thursday, given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note.

Tesla’s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a “potentially unsustainable driver” of earnings and cash flow.

Automakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year, and if they can’t meet the target, they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles.

Tesla earnings also got a boost from FSD, the company’s Full Self-Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called “Actually Smart Summon.”

CEO Elon Musk said on the call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.

Even bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk’s forecast and wrote, in a note following the earnings report, “Our view remains more reserved at 10-15% (~2.03m),” and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30,000 after subsidies, and other variants of the small SUV.",4112,True,1729801558.0,2024-10-24 22:25:58,558,381,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gbcgse/tesla_stock_has_best_day_in_over_a_decade_on/,True,0.8,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1gh1z43,,Need help regarding intrinsic value ,"So the stock in question is Tesla.

I have done lots of research into the company and it’s finances and have used multiple methods in order to determine an intrinsic value (including margin of safety) to find a nice entry price. The methods I have used are:

1) Discounted cash flow ($50.49)
2) Multiples valuation model ($31.81)
3) Graham’s valuation model ($179.41)

This is not to say that my valuations are correct by any means, and I accept there could be faults in my calculations. My concern is that Grahams valuation model has produced the highest IV by some margin. However, it seems quite reasonable given how Tesla stock has traded over the last few years that this could be fairly accurate. I just want some advice on how people would use these numbers. Would you:

Although Warren Buffett and we must always do our best to surpass our heroes like all Olympic records are meant to be broken (coz' in part technology, rule change and medicine advances) or NBA stars like MJ surpassing their heroes and Warren Buffett is still the genius compared to 93.% of investors and traders (the remaining 7% are the other stars like Peter Lynch), he's also made a few mistakes (Amazon is the best example coz' he always insists he doesn't understand technology which is honestly not that hard to understand but may be hard to see the road ahead when the internet was democratized including made affordable for the common working man with a decent salary ala Henry Ford's speech):

granted he loves CEOs and founders who have a laid back personality that are orthodox but orthodox in the big way, like Tim Cook, and granted TSLA is overbought by saying TSLA has the market cap of the auto industry combined vs. it's book value (math part of things, ruled by figures/number so it's more a part of technical analysis still), is he avoiding TSLA because:

a)  Elon Musk's personality is the biggest Think Big of all Think Bigs in the industrial history (way bigger than Henry Ford or Vanderbilt and the others who built industrial america which spilled to the world) and he's not comfortable with that

post,1gjd018,,"Boeing: Navigating Challenges, Securing Growth—A Resilient Investment Opportunity in Aerospace","**Boeing as a Potential Investment Opportunity**

Boeing stands as one of the most important players in the aerospace industry, with a heavily established brand and legacy that commands trust around the world. Despite recent operational and financial challenges affecting its stock price, Boeing’s intrinsic value and reputation position it as a viable investment. While relatively short-term setbacks have impacted shareholder sentiment, these issues are likely irrelevant in terms of Boeing’s long-term prospects as a leader in aviation. For a company of Boeing’s stature, resilience and success are inevitable, making it a viable investment opportunity amidst doubt in the markets.

**Boeing’s Brand Strength and Market Perception**

Since its founding in 1916, Boeing has had a long-standing reputation for safety and reliability. The company has bolstered its reputation through engineering marvels like the Boeing 747. Although Boeing has recently had many notable incidents, they have focused on being transparent and open with its shareholders. For example, production issues with the 787 Dreamliner, delays in the 777X program, software glitches affecting 737 MAX deliveries, supply chain disruptions, and quality control concerns have been openly handled by the company as they have been in direct communication with the National Transportation Safety Board in order to improve and learn from their mistakes. Another key factor is brand loyalty. Boeing’s brand strength is comparable to companies such as Coca-Cola and Apple. This loyalty and strength has been based on customer trust, market stability, innovation, and collaboration. Ultimately, Boeing’s long-standing reputation allows it to build strong brand loyalty, further bolstering its position in the aerospace industry and ensuring its continued relevance and resilience in the market. 

Boeing has a huge brand name that involves years of experience in the market, which competitors like COMAC and others lack.",9335,True,1730723185.0,2024-11-04 13:26:25,0,3,Goatofoptions,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gjd018/boeing_navigating_challenges_securing_growtha/,True,0.31,2024,elon,search,False,False,0,
post,1gjgc5a,,"I test drove a bunch more EVs, my thoughts on the winners and losers (Part 2)","[Given the unexpected popularity of my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1fygp10/test_drove_10_evs_at_a_local_event_my_thoughts_on/), and my hunt for EVs taking on more of a active role given a $2500 repair bill + the prospect of more in the summer for my wife's car, I've been taking more EVs out for a spin. I figured I'd share what I learned with the class, and hopefully someone else can benefit or just have fun reading about it

To answer some of the questions from the last post:

If a car isn't here, it's because I haven't driven it for whatever reason. As well, the EV landscape in Canada is pretty different from the EV landscape in the US. You guys seem to be getting incentive after incentive, and while it's *starting* to get better (no more \~4 year waitlist for an Ioniq 5!) we're probably where you were at \~1-2 years ago in terms of incentive. For example, the best lease deal I found on a non-stripper Ioniq 5 is around $1000 CAD/$720 USD. Likewise, while I'd love a $299 USD deal on an Equinox I see people posting about, best deal I got quoted from multiple dealers was \~$600 CAD/$420 USD

Most Surprising (Positive): Ford Mustang Mach-e

Most Surprising (Negative): Audi Q4

Best Value: Volkswagen ID.4 (among this crop, but overall is still the Tesla Model 3 LR RWD Highland)

Worst Value: Tesla Model Y standard range

Volkswagen ID.4: 5/10

This is the car version of vanilla ice cream. This is a car that uses energy to move wheels to get you places. This is a product you can purchase with money from selling your labour

There's nothing *wrong* with the ID.4. Both on paper and in real life, it is a competent driving object. It's just so fucking *bland*. There are certainly EVs who drive blandly, I've talked about them here. But usually they offer something to offset that; some sort of utility (the Lyriq/RZ and its comfort, the Equinox in its affordability), just... something.",13581,True,1730732563.0,2024-11-04 16:02:43,165,75,stav_and_nick,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1gjgc5a/i_test_drove_a_bunch_more_evs_my_thoughts_on_the/,True,0.85,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1glgi9i,,What Trump’s Return Could Mean for the EV Industry,"Trump just won, so I'm imagining there may be some changes to the U.S. EV business. The Rev Up America report credited rapid growth in the EV market to federal incentives, tougher emissions standards targeting automakers and a suite of clean energy policies enacted during Biden's presidency. Now, however, Trump is likely to roll back policies that would have mandated greenhouse gas emissions near-zero and incentive programs bringing EV tax credits, which could have accelerated adoption over time.

Large shifts may — indeed should — come in trade policy. Previously, Trump advocated for less dependency on China — a move likely to entail higher tariffs on components of EV batteries coming from foreign markets. While this may strengthen domestic manufacturing, it would also increase EV prices to consumers.

Trump’s administration could also contest California's independent emissions standards followed by 17 other states. With Californian stances of less importance, automakers can back off the gas on zero-emission vehicle aims darkening green innovation.

This shift, while eroding some stability in the sector, isn't wiping out support from brands such as Ford and GM for green commitments. And Trump will have Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, in his corner, seeking federal backing for self-driving technology (we expect). Plus other EV infrastructure improvements may not be pursued as quickly.

So in short, I'm expecting a new chapter of EV hurdles and openings, one that could redefine U.S. journey toward sustainable mobility as the industry adapts.",1558,False,1730947670.0,2024-11-07 03:47:50,66,292,65ybrook,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1glgi9i/what_trumps_return_could_mean_for_the_ev_industry/,True,0.7,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1gmxjs6,,Election Implications for U.S. EV Tax Credit,"I'm an energy lobbyist in D.C. and kept this subreddit updated during the Inflation Reduction Act negotiations in 2022 that modified the EV tax credit. I wanted to share an update on where things stand.

**Why is the election important for the EV tax credit?**

While I, along with most of the D.C. world, viewed divided government as the most likely outcome of the election, Republicans have already gained control of the Senate (with a 3 vote majority buffer) and are favorites to take the House. At the time of this post, the House breakdown is 212 Republican, 199 Democrat, with 24 seats to be called. 218 seats cements the majority.

When one party controls the White House, Senate, and House, it unlocks a procedural tool called Budget Reconciliation. This avoids the 60-vote filibuster in the Senate that normally kills partisan legislation and is how the IRA was passed and Trump's 2017 tax cut bill was passed.

Many provisions from Trump's tax cuts start to expire in 2025 so he will be looking to take up another large tax reform bill. In order to pay for other priorities, like extending the increased standard deduction, higher child tax credits, and adding in some new priorities like possibly no taxes on tips or social security, they'll find offsets elsewhere in the law to repeal. Unfortunately, the EV tax credit will be one of the first things they go after.

**How will it change? Will they simply go back to how it was pre-IRA with caps for manufacturers?**

It's unclear how they decide to change it but the goal is to reduce the ""score"" which is just a term for how much a legislative proposal costs or saves the government. The cleanest path would be to simply sunset the EV tax credit. They could also make it so that it's impossible to qualify for the credit: reduce the MSRP of the cars that qualify even further or require the entire supply chain going into the car to be from the U.S.",4016,True,1731112027.0,2024-11-09 01:27:07,288,179,FiveDollarHoller,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1gmxjs6/election_implications_for_us_ev_tax_credit/,True,0.96,2024,both,search,False,False,0,
post,1gnkp4u,,"Texas residents write your Senator and Representative to keep the IRA EV incentives, perhaps only way to save it.","Trump has bashed EV and promised to get rid of the any and all programs to make it easier to get a BEV (and renewable systems).  Do not count on Elon Musk saving that, he has voiced disagreement to it.  Yet it will not take much to change his mind.

Tesla Motors in now based in Austin, Texas and is a massive glowing jobs engine within literal sight of the Texas capital. It is obvious the loss of incentive will slow sales of Tesla cars, and impact jobs growth in Texas.

Bigger news is CleanTechnica reported that of [the 20 top selling plug in cars all but 2 were Chinese](https://cleantechnica.com/2024/11/08/what-falling-sales-plugins-grew-to-a-record-1-7-million-units-in-september/), with Tesla not only in the list, but holding the #1 and #3 position.      
This is exactly the kind of news Trump would brag about endlessly and promote to keep that #1 spot.  To do that keeping the IRA intact is vital.

On aside, solar and wind growth in Texas is outpacing California, and may be second only to China in the world.  Another massive benefit for Texas.

**John Cornyn** is the senior senator, and not just that, he very likely next Senate Leader, thus will control the agenda.  **As Senate Leader he could easily kill any bill that will eliminate benefits for Texas.** His [contact web page is here](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/contact-john-cornyn/).

post,1gydc1p,,Driving School,"Hi everyone. I’m at a crossroad and stuck with decision making.
I was in Aerospace (Boeing/Lockeed/SpaceX) and in 2022 I decided to start a driving school for teens. I had experience as an instructor when I was attending UCLA and was qualified to get a license (you’d need 2000 hours of experience, I had 5000 hours)
My ideas was to have an upscale driving school which really does high quality driving lessons. I’m based in LA. First year just with 1 car I did $4000 in sales (last 2 months of 2022), in 2023 I added a Tesla too (the other car is Honda HRV) and my sales were $36K. This year will be about $50K.
My biggest issue is instructors, I have no shortage of people calling. In 2022, 2023, and this year I just break even with no Salary for myself. I invested a lot of the profit in advertising and such. I spent $18K in Google ads in the last 2 years, but now I only spend $300/month and the phone doesn’t stop.
My dilemma is: should I get a huge loan like $200K-300K and hire full time positions, bigger office with driving simulators, basically going all out, or should I chill and keep going at this pace?
I worked 20 years in aerospace and am scared to lose my little condo I purchased in LA.
In my early 20s before attending ucla I had a successful clothing company for 9 long years but after 9/11 it imploded and I lost everything. So I’m scared.
My school has become very popular. I am the most expensive driving school in LA, and I constantly have to turn down clients because I don’t have the capacity. Just 2 cars and 1 instructor (myself) and 2 very part-time instructors.
Did I mention I only broke even? I reinvest every penny so that I don’t pay taxes (except payroll tax for instructors) Also my biggest cost is commercial car insurance for the 2 cars at $1200/month!
If I get more cars I can potentially pay $1200/year per car…

But I still think the company is very overvalued. I would think 250 is a fair value or maybe even less. 

Let's be honest the overvaluation is due to people having strong feeling for Elon Musk not bcs the company has an economic moat.

So the question we need to ask ourselves is: will the postive sentiment end at any point in the near future and honestly I do not think so. Bunch of recent tweets were pretty controversial and all that but I feel like this won't have any further impact atm. I just read they are recently started production on the newest Y model and it's supposed to be available in early 2025 so this might actually push the price up until then.

But I really feel like it is so risky to invest in the stock.

post,1h4063m,,A Second or Third Revisit of Why Warren Buffet May Not Have Fully Understood TSLA When He Said Value is Equivalent to the Whole Car Industry,"Hi investment friends, starting with the point of this analysis: Tesla, is a Wrigley's or a Coca Cola or our era but with a beyond imagining more future potential. 

Warren Buffett's although we love him, he's one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto ""invest in things you understand"" (it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz' most are very much understandable or it's just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as I call his favorites, assets like gum, candy, airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers) but there's still that constant, that he's not infallible. What it means to 'understand' has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before.

As most have said in the tech industry, sir Warren's fundamental which includes that it's highly speculative (also it's not on the record but it implies he's not into Elon Musk's kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but that's another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads Tesla) analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz' it's most likely incomplete. As most have said Tesla is not just a car company, it's not just a products company selling cars. What was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized, an example is EV cars that are practical compared to EVs from generations past, now you have the many Models of Tesla. Elon Musk w/ Tesla has proof that they can execute what seems to be many as speculative (although I don't agree with him 100%, especially when it comes to 100% autonomy, coz' technology is buy a tool for mankind and will always babysit any technology).",2532,True,1733047478.0,2024-12-01 11:04:38,0,20,SevenDeMagnus,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h4063m/a_second_or_third_revisit_of_why_warren_buffet/,True,0.16,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1h7clsd,,"Waymo to expand to Miami, aims to launch robotaxi service there in 2026","Waymo is setting its sights on its next location: the Sunshine State.

The Alphabet-owned company announced Thursday that it will be hitting the roads in Miami. Waymo said it will first begin cruising through the Florida city with human safety drivers in 2025 before opening doors to riders for its robotaxi service through its Waymo One app in 2026.

The expansion into Miami is indicative of Waymo’s growing confidence in operating its self-driving vehicles in harsher weather conditions in large metropolitan areas in the U.S.

Waymo first tested in Miami in 2019, which the company said helped improve the ability of its self-driving vehicles to navigate in wet and rainy conditions.

“We deepened our learning and understanding of the Waymo Driver’s performance in adverse weather conditions,” a company spokesperson said.

Waymo will use what it learned when it returns to the city with its all-electric Jaguar I-PACEs next year.

The company said its initial territory in Florida will include some parts of Miami’s larger metropolitan area, which has a population of more than 6 million people.

Waymo has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.

In November, the company announced it was removing its waitlist of about 300,000 people in Los Angeles, so anyone would be able to use Waymo One to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout the nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County. The company’s ride-hailing service also operates citywide in Phoenix and San Francisco.

And in September, Waymo announced a partnership with Uber in Austin and Atlanta. Through that deal, Uber riders will be able to access Waymo’s robotaxis through the Uber app starting in early 2025, and Uber will be responsible for fleet management and operations of the Waymo vehicles, including maintenance and infrastructure, such as vehicle charging, cleaning and repairs.",3822,True,1733414780.0,2024-12-05 17:06:20,326,118,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h7clsd/waymo_to_expand_to_miami_aims_to_launch_robotaxi/,True,0.97,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

2. What happens if I leave my card and phone inside while I get out of the car? Do I get locked out?

3. Does regen braking degrade the brake pads the same way normal braking does?

4. Has anyone upgraded their brakes from Tesla? On the app, the only way I found to upgrade them is by buying the track pack (which isn't something I want, and is also out of stock.) The brakes on the Plaid are far too weak.

5. Aaaand finally, the most important question...

post,1h9i57c,,"I'm bullish on Rivian, and here is why.","Currently holding 65 shares, looking to round that out to 100 next pay period.  I am not a financial advisor, and this is not investment advice. I am simply sharing my thoughts. 

These are the things I will be watching this year, to continue to add to my position, or to see if I should reconsider my bullish sentiment. 

1. Nearing profitability.  Rivian has recently re-affirmed that by Q4 2024 we will be seeing gross profit per vehicle. They are expected to deliver just over 50,000 vehicles for the year. That is a combination of mostly R1S and R1T with some of the Amazon delivery vans. If there guidance is correct, and they either meet or beat q4 '24 earnings, it is a bullish sign.

  
2. $6 Billion loan from Uncle Sam. Now the new administration does create a bit of tension here.  The new ""DOGE"" agency is going to be cutting Gov. spending across the board. There is some concern they will take away this loan that the Biden administration had given to Rivian. While this is certainly a possibility, I do not think it is going to happen. I think it would be a very bad look politically, and would give strength to the argument musk will us his Gov. connections to attack his competitors. Because of that, I think this money is safely staying with Rivian.  If it turns out DOGE is going to back down from this threat, that is another bullish sign.

  
3. VW Rivian joint venture. VW NA is about to change, they are getting a new CEO, Kjell Gruner, who previously was the President and CEO of Porsche Cars of North America and then moved to Rivian to be there ""Chief Commercial Officer & President, Business Growth"".  VW desperatley needs software expertise, and Rivian delivers that in spades. That combined with VWs massive buying and production power, is a strong match. This is a bullish sign right now, and what I think has been pushing to stock upwards. 

VW has been hurting and their reputation is in the pits.",3083,True,1733662070.0,2024-12-08 13:47:50,52,111,TheMensChef,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h9i57c/im_bullish_on_rivian_and_here_is_why/,True,0.63,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

59K Euro's for the top trip and Tesla still costs a few thousand Euro's more. Then there's the build quality of the Sealion, which blows Tesla out of the water. Then there's the features...heads up display, rotating display, car play and android auto, working wipers, range etc.

Here in Canada, the government is following the US, naturally, and is imposing a 100% tariff on Chinese EV's. Mind you, this is all happening while the very same peoples are shouting about the environment and climate change being \*the\* existential issue of our time.

I don't know how to feel. I understand why NA/EU are afraid of Chinese EV's, and people having jobs that pay well and with dignity is also critical; but I really hate how we keep getting bombarded with exceptionally pricey EV's and even no tax breaks or very little, all while people are struggling to survive. WTF are people supposed to do but stick with gasoline vehicles then? It's not like public transport is any good or timely in winter especially.

This whole environmental/government angle has shot itself in the foot with how this has been handled. 

Sealion top trim is roughly $44,000 CAD without tariffs, with tariffs it is $88,000 CAD. 

Tesla Model Y is roughly $67,000 CAD for the LR without any special paint or FSD, etc.

Tesla Model 3 is roughly $63,000 CAD for the LR without any special paint or FSD, etc.

\^ This, is ridiculous and no amount of protecting our industries to give them time to play catch up, makes it reasonable for consumers.

Yes, there are used EV's on the market and I am considering one myself, but by the same token, used Chinese EV's would be even cheaper still and still offer more!

post,1hbcp93,,GM halts funding of robotaxi development by Cruise,"General Motors said Tuesday that it will no longer fund robotaxi development work by Cruise citing “capital allocation priorities,” and “the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.”

The Detroit automaker plans to “realign its autonomous driving strategy” to focus on advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous systems for use in personal vehicles instead, and it will combine the majority-owned Cruise LLC and GM technical teams.

This summer, the Detroit automaker said it would indefinitely delay production of the Origin autonomous vehicle as its Cruise self-driving unit attempted to relaunch operations. At that point, Cruise began to focus on using the next-generation Chevrolet Bolt for development of autonomous vehicles since then.

In the U.S. Alphabet-owned Waymo has begun to operate commercial robotaxi services across several major metro areas while GM-owned Cruise has faltered. Chinese autonomous vehicle makers including Pony.ai and WeRide have rolled out in overseas markets as well.

Tesla, meanwhile, showed off design concepts for a self-driving Cybercab at an event in October. Tesla still classifies the Autopilot and Full Self-Driving software in its vehicles as “partially automated driving systems,” which require a human to be ready to steer or brake at all times. In an October earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in California and Texas as early as 2025.

SoftBank-funded Wayve is testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, and Amazon-owned Zoox is also testing its autonomous vehicles, which do not feature steering wheels, in several U.S. cities including San Francisco.

> Elon Musk’s net worth has reached $400 billion, according to Bloomberg, making him the first person ever to cross that mark. Behind his nearly $20 billion jump in wealth was a deal that shot up Musk’s rocket company SpaceX’s valuation to roughly $350 billion, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. SpaceX and its investors agreed to purchase as much as $1.25 billion of insider shares. Tesla shares closed at a record high on Wednesday, hitting $424.77 at market close. Musk, who is Tesla’s largest individual shareholder, has also enjoyed the stock propelling higher in part due to the broader market — NASDAQ topped 20,000 for the first time ever Wednesday.

While the top spots on the billionaires index typically switch around, Musk is racing past his wealthy peers.

post,1hcqtr1,,Returning to active stock portfolio management,"I recently decided to return to active stock portfolio management after my first attempt ended somewhat disastrously. To reconcile this experience and entertain others, I want to reflect on the mistakes I made and the new approaches I’ve adopted.

But first, briefly, the story of my initial failure.

When I started managing my portfolio, I quickly learned about the S&P 500 but was convinced I was smart enough to outperform the market. Arrogance was one of the main reasons for my downfall.

In 2019, I flirted with Bitcoin, which initially delivered great returns. Encouraged by the hype, I also invested heavily in PaySafe shortly after its IPO, believing in its potential because “everyone” said it was going to be great. At the same time, I was doing a lot of day trading. Looking back, I realize I wasn’t trading rationally. I’d look at graphs and invest simply because I felt the price would go up. I was taking desirable outcomes for granted.

Although I made a few conservative and reasonable investments, their success couldn’t offset the losses caused by Bitcoin’s decline, PaySafe’s terrible performance, and my risky trading. After 18 months, my portfolio was down 40%.

The arrogance I started with made the loss feel devastating. I abandoned my investment account for several years.

When I returned to it a year ago, I discovered that the growth of my conservative investments, along with Bitcoin’s recovery, had boosted my portfolio to 20% growth from my initial investment. I sold everything and bought into the S&P 500, feeling that I wasn’t capable of picking good stocks and should leave that to the fund. This turned out to be a good action, as the S&P 500 performed very well this year.

Now, I feel I’ve learned from my mistakes and am ready to approach active investing again. 

To avoid repeating the same mistakes, I’ve set specific rules to guide me:

post,1hfprfx,,Savings Diversity - General Questions,"So I have a general question about the cash that I'm keeping on hand.

I have about 40K in savings right now. Here is the breakdown:

33K in a HYS (3.8 APY)

6K in a different HYS (6.5 APY but I can only add 2K per month so I have an automatic transfer from the 3.8 account into this one. Every year the money all gets kicked out in August so it's a constant cycle)

$750 initially invested right now (650 in VTI/VOO ETFS - 100 in Tesla Stock)

I have about 13k in retirement as well (70% low risk 30% moderate risk)

Should I have more of my money invested into S&P ETFs that would likely outpace the 3.9 HYS? What do you think my diversity should be between all of these options?

post,1hfr8dz,,Achieved my first milestone after 3 years!,"After 3 years of investing, I've finally achieved my goal of investing my first $100,000! This was a challenge I gave myself after hearing Warren Buffet say you should strive to invest 100k into the market. *(I know that by now it's inflated to likely be the equivalent of 300k, but that's my next goal.)*

I did this by living with my parents and paying low but fair rent, finding a decent job that pays 75k-80k a year, avoiding fast food where possible, and just being frugal in general. 

**Investment strategy:**

1. investing $10 every business day into both VOO and VOOG. *(roughly $400 a month)*  
2. investing in Tesla when Tesla is low. *(this is 20% of my portfolio. My largest position.)*  
3. keeping my ear to the ground, and capitalizing on things like meta's stock devaluing. *(Though, I totally missed Nvidia sadly.)*  
4. diversifying into other promising tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google. *(less than fruitful, but it's still diversified.)*

I think the riskiest strategy has been in Tesla. In the past, it's been difficult watching the stock go up and down, but I had faith in their business practices and ethics. Now Tesla is popping off, and given Elon's position with Trump, this should give room for Tesla to continue its growth. Sadly, because of that, I can't view Tesla as much as an ethical company as much as I could in the past, but that won't diminish it's ability to grow and I see the stock continuing to rise in the future.

**Looking forward:**

Since Tesla isn't going to be low for some time, one thing I want to invest in going forward is in clean power companies, such as nuclear for AI companies. So I'll continue looking into that for future paychecks to go to. Any recommendations are welcome!

My next goal will be to reach $300,000 invested by the end of 2026. What do you all think?

post,1hfs25j,,"Reminder: If You Trade More, Wall Street Makes More Money","I've spent a few years reading Warren Buffett and other value investors. Essentially what I learned is that they make money by other people pushing prices too high or too low. Especially when prices become too low, they swoop in and buy a bunch. Next they sit on it a few years until the price goes to the correct valuation again, or preferably after many years when the company deteriorates.

Time and time again, people have predicted that Buffett's strategy will eventually stop working. We nowadays can learn much more etc etc.

Yet, stock prices are all over the place. Tesla doubled in the last 3 months for example. How is that possible? How can a 1T dollar company double in value in 3 months? They still build the same stuff with roughly the same people. Similar for Bitcoin. Also almost doubled in a few months. If that was inevitable according to some metric, then why was it not priced in?

At the same time, there is a common sentiment online that the world is becoming more and more unequal. More wealth accumulates in the hands of a few people.

So let me say this: if you are currently considering buying into some stock that went up recently, please let me remind you that there is only one party that will always make money from your trade. It's not you. It's your broker/Wall Street. They don't care whether you make money or lose money. Some will slam ""price targets"" on stocks if that makes you trade. Some will call other stocks ""uninvestible"" if that makes you trade.",1490,False,1734379359.0,2024-12-16 21:02:39,0,9,rik-huijzer,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfs25j/reminder_if_you_trade_more_wall_street_makes_more/,True,0.36,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1hfy0q8,,Ponzi Spotting: a laymen's guide to differentiating investments from Ponzi schemes,"I often see things being called Ponzi schemes on Reddit that are very much not Ponzi schemes. Usually, it always stems from the criticism that a particular investment only goes up in price because someone newer is paying a higher price for it. Hence, it must be a Ponzi.

I’m going to blow your minds a little bit. 

Almost all (legitimate) investments require new investors willing to pay a higher price for older investors to cash out a profit. 

Most investable objects, REGARDLESS of what underlies the object, trade at a price on a market. This means, at the margin, some percentage (usually only a small percentage) of the total available supply of the object is trading hands. The trade is priced typically in your local fiat currency, but this does not necessarily have to be the case. Prices are determined by supply and demand. When an investable object goes up in price on a market, it means there were no sellers of the object at the lower price, and price goes up until the next marginal seller decides they are willing to part with that object at the higher price. 

The use of the term investable object is intentionally left extremely broad. It essentially means anything quantifiable that can be owned and traded. This includes contracts, stocks, bonds, physical objects, digital objects, etc. 

**Example 1.** You bought a 1st edition charizard for 20 dollars when it came out in the 1990’s. Since it was relatively abundant (still being printed by the company) and Pokemon was relatively new at the time, the supply was high and the demand was low. Fast forward 30 years, Pokemon is super popular and there are very few 1st edition charizards remaining (out of print for decades, many were lost or destroyed through the years). You now are able to sell the charizard for 10,000 dollars to a guy that just got into Pokemon card collecting.

But only time will tell if the pattern will repeat itself with Canoo, it has a great design, innovative, especially their MPDV (I wish that was the one they focused on but had a smaller non-van version with the same). It just needs to launch already their working models (unlike that Nikola truck which even got GM fooled) have amazing design especially the shelf mechanism of their nice looking MPDV. 

If they just did a pre-order which is a genius strategy pioneered by amazing Apple, God-willing they will break through but they also need to upgrade their battery from 200mi to 320mi for good measure.

NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) | $400 | 21.22%

Small Caps (AVUV) | $120 | 6.37%

Individual Stock Picks I like (15 in total, listed below) ** | $225 ($15 each) | 11.94%
**TOTAL** | $1885 | 100%

*The difference between XLF and IAI is that XLF is mostly financial services such as JP Morgan Visa, Mastercard, Bank of America, Wells Fargo etc..., whereas IAI is mostly brokers and securities dealers such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Schwab, S&P Global etc... There is only a 15% overlap between these two ETFs.

I think at first glance, some will say that there is a little redundancy here, such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism, although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually, in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds.

post,1hnvkux,,My review of the BMW iX M60 after a week long road trip ,"A review of the BMW iX M60 after a week long road trip. 

A review of the BMW iX M60 after a week long loaner

I recently had the BMW iX M60 for a week as a loaner. I have driven most of the EVs out there, including another week long road tripper (the Mercedes EQS), currently own a Hyundai IONIQ 6, a BMW X5 and BMW M3. I decided to provide some info about my experience road tripping this iX M60 for a week and 700 miles with my family over the Christmas holiday while my wife’s X5 was in the shop. 

Spoiler: not terribly impressed! 

I did use ChatGPT to format this review a bit nicer and closer to a more traditional automotive review, hope no one is too upset but your reading experience is much improved trust me. 

2024 BMW iX M60: A Mixed Bag of Innovation and Compromise

The BMW iX M60 enters the crowded luxury EV market with the promise of blending BMW’s trademark driving dynamics with cutting-edge electrification. Positioned as a performance-oriented alternative to the likes of the Mercedes EQS SUV and Tesla Model X, the iX M60 seeks to redefine what a premium electric SUV can be. Yet, after a week of real-world testing, including a 700-mile road trip, it’s clear that the iX is both a showcase of BMW’s engineering prowess and a reminder of where the brand’s EV journey still falls short.

Charging Woes: A Pain Point for the Price

For an EV that commands a base price north of $112,000, charging performance is a glaring weakness. The iX M60’s advertised fast-charging capability of up to 195kW seems promising on paper, but in practice, it struggles to maintain consistent speeds. Over the course of our trip, the vehicle averaged an underwhelming 90kW at 350kW-capable stations, often dropping to 135kW or lower within minutes. This resulted in 40-minute waits to charge from 20% to 80%, a frustrating reality in a segment where faster charging curves are becoming the norm.",7033,True,1735352634.0,2024-12-28 03:23:54,0,22,SneakyHobbitses1995,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1hnvkux/my_review_of_the_bmw_ix_m60_after_a_week_long/,True,0.29,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1hnwhlf,,Tesla's Genius Autonomous Strategy and Implied Supremacy,"Tesla's autonomous program FSD (Full Self-Driving) will inevitably become the prime competitor in the U.S. to Waymo, and the leader everywhere else where it is legal. I have this conviction because I can look clearly at the actual comparisons of the vehicles statistics rather than their permit level. The reason that it makes sense to ignore the permit level, is that Tesla intentionally declares their autonomous program at Level 2 Autonomy to avoid the increased regulations on testing that Level 3 or Level 4 incur. 

Essentially, what Tesla has seemingly believed from the inception of their FSD program, was that **more Data = better system**. And I agree with them. If we look at any machine learning program or deep learning that has aimed to create a high fidelity system, most of the time the **sheer scale of data has increased output quality immensely**. In deploying their FSD to independent owners who supervise it, they essentially are able to scale their data collection **without** hiring and deploying ""skilled safety testers"" like Waymo has had to in the past to collect data and train their model, giving them a huge leg up in cost efficiency and scalability. 

People don't realize how good Tesla's FSD because of Autopilot's failures. The rollout of Autopilot and the marketing of it has a lot of criticism for good reason, but Full Self-Driving may as well be a different system with how markedly different the crash rates between them are. This is also combined with the fact that **Waymo vehicles have not operated on freeways** while Tesla vehicles have. Waymo only recently began testing on freeways, which is quite insane to me because how can anyone believe that Waymo has achieved technological supremacy when they only started testing on freeways a few months ago?? 

**All of these reasons contribute to my belief that Tesla will achieve Level 5 Autonomy first**.

post,1hwm6z3,,Have Musk's companies collectively made an overall profit across their lifetimes?,"I was explaining to someone the other day how it was that Sam Altman could be a billionaire despite OpenAI not coming close to profitability yet, by referencing the tech industry's model of leveraging huge VC funding via the promise of future market dominance. Whilst I was doing so the question above popped into my head, and I realised I had no idea whether the richest man in the world, who is regularly hailed as a genius, has actually made a total net profit across his companies. For this question I'm only counting the relatively mature ones, namely Tesla, Space X, Twitter, Starlink, SolarCity and The Boring Company. It doesn't seem fair to include Neuralink or any others than are still very much in R&D phase.

Two of these companies - SpaceX and Starlink - are doing very well currently, and look well set for future growth, Tesla is doing OK but there are warning lights flickering, and as for the others, well....

What I'm really interested though is, at this point in history, two specific questions:  
1) have the companies listed above made a collective profit or loss across their lifetimes to date?

2) how the collective profits (if any) of these companies compares to the investment that they have taken in to date, ie their collective return on investment.  
  
I appreciate these could be seen as unfair questions to ask, as that investment was premised on significant further growth far into the future (even when, as with Tesla, those projections stopped making much sense a long time ago), but nevertheless I still think its worth asking, given that in the here and now Musk himself is using the wealth accrued from these companies to such dramatic effect.

* CFPB to prevent lawsuites against Musk's Tesla, et al.
* FAA for SpaceX
* IRS for Billionaires and tax enforcement
* NIH for NeuroLink
* Treasury for payment funneling

**HOWEVER, at the end of the day, I think Elon has another end goal:** 

DOGE is training various AI models on massive amounts of government data to ultimately ensure an Elon AI model(s) will be embedded permanantly into the US government making pennies off each prompt. Leading to the first 100 person, $200 billion in revenue organization.

post,1j8d48n,,DANGER: DO NOT TOW WITH A CYBERTRUCK? - (catastrophic failure test),"Video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubUXNSWGth0, quite the title

Description:  The Tesla Cybertruck is built with a cast aluminum frame <redacted sponsor> This helps the cyber truck be manufactured extremely quickly. However - cast aluminum is not good for towing as we see in this Cybertruck durability test video. The hitch breaks around 10,000 pounds. (4500kg) Which is far too close to the 11,000 pound towing capacity. Yikes. 

Saw the video circulating around reddit with outrage elsewhere, was looking for some discussion. Thousands of valid reasons to hate the cybertruck and the company behind it, but unless I am missing something it seems like the cybertruck did quite good here no? He put pretty much pure tongue load on that hitch, the tongue weight rating on this is 1,100lbs from tesla, and it only failed @ 10,000lbs, nearly 10x. 

Justification given for the test in the video was that with improper loading or an impact trailer weight can/will be converted to tongue weight, but I feel that is user error and under similar circumstances the rivian wouldn't fare particularly well either. I think SAE standard here its 50% GVWR x/y and 150% z, which it would pass fine. 

Could argue that the failure mode isn't ideal as demonstrated in the whistlindiesel video, and the properties of aluminum aren't ideal for a truck & perhaps we will see failure over time, but it seems to me like he proving tesla's engineering right here? (and as an aside, his explanation of fatigue limit was backwards). Same thing with the glue, modern 3M panel bond & similar adhesive hold up just as well & often better than welding, cars are full of structural adhesives.

Even into the 2000s, when Nissan was already starting their decline, they put out some bangers - the G35/37 (Skyline) was seen as what the Z buyer got after starting a family - the performance of a sports car with the added practicality of a sedan. The M35/45 (Fuga/Gloria) was a super underrated luxury sedan that offered a compelling alternative to the Lexus GS and a way to get an otherwise-JDM only product in left hand drive. The FX35/45 was a trendsetter in the luxury SUV world - it paved the way for the Porsche Cayenne, Land Rover Range Rover Sport, and other sportier luxury SUVs as well. The 350/370Z were widely celebrated at launch - a sports car for the 21st century, one of the best-handling cars this side of a 911 and a worthy model to carry the iconic badge. And even their regular stuff wasn't half bad - V6 Altimas and Maximas in the USA were sleepers - the V6 Altima had more power than the Camry, Accord or Mazda6, the XTerra was another 4Runner alternative, the Primera was a competitive hatch in Europe, the original X-Trail came from an era when crossovers were still fun and cute and not every other car on the road, and the Elgrand minivan in Japan oozed VIP elegance in that oh-so-JDM way.",3386,True,1741905574.0,2025-03-13 23:39:34,0,32,thats__hot,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1jaowts/how_many_of_us_would_be_sad_if_nissan_went_under/,True,0.43,2025,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1jfkoj5,,I legit don't understand the Elon/Tesla hate.,"Hey guys,

I've been a fan of Elon for a very long time. I've read both biographies, watched easily \~80%+ of his interviews (there are a LOT out there now), and I resonate deeply with so much of how he thinks and what he does for the world.

That said, clearly, he's rubbed some people the wrong way.  
At the very least, there's a lot hatred being directed his way.

I'd love to explore this with people and help bridge what seems to be a growing divide.

I think the first step is by beginning to understand the people who do have hatred for Elon & Tesla, why that hatred is there?

I trust that more people than not genuinely want good things for the world, so I think we have that in common, and I'd like to build on that.

post,1jfpo6n,,I’ve been very impressed by BYD while visiting Brazil,"I’ve been in Brazil for 15 days and love this BYD dolphin. When I first saw it, I did not love the styling, but it’s been an absolute joy. I’ve driven Teslas (model 3 and model y) up and down California numerous times. The BYD feels more luxurious and less cheap in almost every way. 


I have not experienced a single phantom breaking while in a BYD. I had 3 in one day the last time I drove a Tesla. On the byd, the driver assistance has just worked. 


The interior is MUCH better. Tesla seats and interiors feel cheap. The stealing wheels wear quickly due to how thin the material is. I thought a Tesla was quiet due to the lack of ICE, but the BYD has much less road noise on wayyy shittier cobblestone roads. The seats are more comfortable and EVERY surface material feels more less cheap and flimsy.


The car is much more intuitive than a Tesla. The Tesla OS is always a pain to figure out where basic shit is. I had to pull over and watch a YouTube video to figure out how to do something on a road, but have found the dolphin to be very intuitive. The screen also rotates from landscape to horizontal which is nice to watch YouTube. Charging has taken 20-40 minutes each time.


On the whole, the BYD felt like a proper luxury car (think lexus) while the Tesla just felt very cheap and gimmicky. If we could get BYDs in CA, I’d buy one when I got back. The Dolphin plus is R$169k which is under $30k usd.


TLDR: the BYD dolphin is surprisingly nice and I want one.


Edit: I’m a California lawyer who is passionate about cars. My business / family fleet is currently:


Rx 350 f sport, Yukon Denali xl, 4Runner, forester xt, mazda 3, Corolla, a 2023 model y, and 2 Tesla model 3s (2019 and 2024).

Tesla’s sold over 1.8 million electric cars in 2023 alone, slashing emissions and making EVs legit—dude’s basically dragging us into a cleaner future. SpaceX? Reusable rockets, ISS missions, and a real shot at Mars. This isn’t sci-fi; it’s Musk making us a multi-planetary species. Neuralink’s pushing brain-tech boundaries, and The Boring Company’s tackling urban gridlock. Oh, and he quietly dropped $5.7 billion in Tesla shares for charity in 2021. Time made him Person of the Year for a reason.

So why the endless hate here? It’s the media—especially the leftist outlets like CNN and NYT—pushing this fake “salute” narrative to torch his rep. They’re obsessed with painting him as some alt-right villain, cherry-picking X drama (yeah, hate speech’s up 50% since he took over, per Berkeley) while ignoring the bigger picture. Why? Musk’s running Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, cutting through the fraud and waste that’s been lining their cronies’ pockets for years. That threatens their gravy train, so they’re desperate to take him down with any smear they can cook up.

He’s not perfect, but the guy’s doing more for us than the media will ever admit. Stop swallowing the narrative and give credit where it’s due.

post,1jrqzht,,Rocket Lab (RKLB): A Promising Space Stock for the Post-Musk Era,"Elon Musk’s ventures have long dominated “space investing” conversations – but with Musk’s recent controversies and the fact that SpaceX isn’t publicly traded, investors are turning toward Rocket Lab as an attractive alternative. Rocket Lab (RKLB) is a \~$10–11B market cap space company that offers something SpaceX doesn’t: public market access to a growing space business, minus the Musk-related volatility. Let’s break down why RKLB might deserve a spot in a forward-looking portfolio:

* Robust Growth Trajectory: Rocket Lab’s financials showcase a company on the rise. 2024 revenues hit $436M (+78% YoY) , and Q4 alone grew 121% YoY. They’ve consistently increased launch count (16 launches in 2024 vs 10 in 2023) and expanded their Space Systems segment (which now brings in \~two-thirds of revenue via satellite manufacturing and components). Gross margins are improving (32% non-GAAP in 2024) , pointing to economies of scale. While the company is not net profitable yet (as it reinvests in growth), Wall Street expects continued top-line expansion and eventual operating leverage as larger projects come online .
* Catalysts on the Horizon: The big one is Neutron, Rocket Lab’s next-gen reusable rocket aimed at the medium-lift market. Management has scheduled the first launch for H2 2025 . This could be a game-changer – Neutron is designed to lift up to 13 tons to LEO , putting Rocket Lab in direct competition with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 for many satellite launch contracts. If successful, Neutron opens a much larger addressable market (national security launches, interplanetary missions, even crewed flights eventually). Investors are watching this closely; any positive development (engine tests, on-time construction) could boost the stock. In the meantime, Rocket Lab isn’t waiting around: they’ve signed new launch deals (e.g.",5349,True,1743812749.0,2025-04-05 02:25:49,0,15,cheese_and_toasted,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jrqzht/rocket_lab_rklb_a_promising_space_stock_for_the/,True,0.5,2025,both,search,False,False,0,

Current P/E of 100+ is ridiculous and I personally think it should be worth less then 25$ a share. However, I have been following this stock and honestly: I never had the balls to short it. Seeing how irrational this stock behaved, and how many times short sellers got screwed. Never have I been more convinced a stock is incredibly overvalued though. but I admit I was too chicken.

I think the bubble has bursted and it wil keep dropping from where we are.

I posted something on another sub that one of members of this community suggested would be better received here. So, I decided to give it shot with this one. I get that this is ""TLDR"" for most people so if you are not into that, let me jump right to the question for you:

Will the negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's stock enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?

post,1ju68ef,,How China’s Restrictions on Rare Earth Mineral Exports would Affect the EV Industry,"China’s restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, notably tightened as of April 4, 2025, are poised to significantly impact the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) industry. Rare earths like neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium are essential for the high-performance magnets in EV motors, while elements like lanthanum are used in batteries. China controls roughly 60-70% of global rare earth mining and nearly 90% of processing, giving it a chokehold on the supply chain that the U.S. EV sector heavily relies on.
The immediate effect is supply disruption. The U.S. imports about 74% of its rare earths from China (down from 80% a decade ago), and with export controls escalating—starting with gallium, germanium, and graphite in 2023 and expanding to other rare earths in 2024 and 2025—manufacturers like Tesla, General Motors, and Ford could face shortages. A single EV motor can require 1-2 kilograms of rare earth magnets, and with U.S. EV sales projected to hit 1.5-2 million units annually by 2030, the demand for these materials is massive. Without a steady supply, production lines could slow or halt, delaying deliveries and driving up costs.
Cost increases are already in motion. Post-restriction price spikes have historical precedent: in 2011, when China cut exports, rare earth prices soared—neodymium hit $67,000 per metric ton. Recent data shows neodymium at $75,097 per metric ton and dysprosium up 4.65% to $250.60 per kilogram as of late 2024, with analysts expecting further climbs in 2025 due to these bans. EVs already use six times more minerals than conventional cars, and with graphite (another restricted mineral) being the largest component in battery anodes (up to 136 pounds per EV), battery prices could jump 18% or more, pushing sticker prices higher and potentially slowing consumer adoption.
Geopolitical leverage amplifies the strain. China’s moves are a response to U.S.",3615,True,1744090345.0,2025-04-08 07:32:25,5,2,kmmeow1,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ju68ef/how_chinas_restrictions_on_rare_earth_mineral/,True,0.57,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1juwpro,,Crude oil an investment with price floor,"With most investments, they have an effective price floor of zero. 
Nvidia, Tesla, GM, BAC any company can go to zero over night but because of the intrinsic self balancing feature of oil price as controlled by OPEC and non-OPEC members. 

Crude oil has a price floor because the producers all have a breakeven price that if it goes under, they all start losing money so they reduce output and bring their price back up. 

For US shale producers in the Permian Basin, that's around $60bbl. For the UAE that's $59bbl. Qatar is $42. 

Right now WTI is at a 52 week low of $62. If it drops another $2 a lot of US producers are gonna start losing money. 

Even with the recession risk that'll drop demand, the suppliers will correspondingly drop supply to keep prices stable. 

As soon as the economy picks back up again, the crude oil price will increase.

My question is, does it make sense to dollar cost average out of the stock as well? For example, let’s say that I want to own 20k usd worth of Tesla.  If Tesla continues to rise so that I could sell a share and still have 20k would it make sense to do that and dollar cost average out?  In the same sense that Tesla goes down so I have less than 20k I would then purchase more shares to get my total value of Tesla stock up to $20,000?

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

post,1k8mm3o,,Sold all my Tesla shares before the crash. Here’s why I still think that was the right call (even at today's price),"A couple of months ago, prior to Tesla correcting by \~40% I no longer believed in the thesis of their stock valuation so I sold my entire holdings. Despite my continued admiration for Tesla’s tech, from an investment standpoint, I remain bearish—and it has little to do with the political horizon. Here’s why:

**Robotaxi: A Limited Revenue Catalyst**

Tesla plans to launch an unsupervised robotaxi service in Austin by mid-2025. However, even Tesla has admitted these vehicles will require human remote monitoring to ensure safety and regulatory compliance—a reality that adds cost and complexity.

The U.S. rideshare and taxi market today generates \~$52 billion annually, projected to grow to \~$61 billion by 2029. Capturing a meaningful slice of that pie won’t be easy:

* Waymo already operates fully autonomous fleets across Phoenix, San Francisco, LA, and Austin, and is expanding into Atlanta, Washington, Miami, and Tokyo.
* Pricing will be critical—and Tesla is playing catch-up technologically.

Even if Tesla somehow captured 25% of the entire U.S. market—a wildly optimistic scenario—it would generate \~$12 billion in revenue and $1–1.5 billion in profit over a decade or more.

More realistically, even under bullish forecasts, Tesla could earn \~$2 billion in revenue and \~$200 million in profit from robotaxis by 2029.

Compare that to Tesla’s current \~$80 billion revenue base.

It would move the needle by only a few percentage points—and that’s assuming everything goes perfectly.

Bottom line: this isn't a market-changing opportunity.

**Optimus: Exciting, But Decades Away From Prime Time**

Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot is expected to be priced around $20,000–$30,000. Elon Musk recently suggested a \~$30,000 target.

At that price, most consumers would expect meaningful labor-saving ROI within 3–5 years. Tasks like:

* Cooking
* Laundry
* Grocery management
* Lawn care and snow removal

post,1kaai3b,,Is PLTR or TSLA a Better Position for AI Growth???,"I want to increase AI exposure in my portoflio because I am really bullish on AI for the future. Im debating between PLTR and TSLA. I feel like TSLA has so much potential in the AI space with their fully autonomous taxi service that allows Tesla owners to make money with their cars, however, waymo is a strong competitor here. The other TSLA project im pretty bullish about is their AI robots. The ceo of Nvidia recently said that they believe autonomous robots are the next stage of the AI boom. I think there is a lot of potential here if companies can adopt them to save money with more manual work.

My biggest worry with Tesla is the controversy surrounding it. Tesla's name has been completely destroyed internationally. BYD was already beating them by a lot but now its going to be bad. I also am a bit worried that the CEO will continue to do more to destroy the Tesla name through other shocking actions.

post,1khk8sf,,"Google is at a 40 pe ratio, excluding the search revenue","Yes, this is another post about how cheap Google is.

Here’s the deal: Google’s net income for 2024 was $100 billion, with 55% of that coming from search.
With a $1.8 trillion market cap, Google would “only” need to have a PE ratio of 40—this is considering revenue only from its fast-growing segments like Cloud, YouTube, Waymo, etc.

To put it in context, here are a few companies with similar businesses and their high PE ratios:

Microsoft: 34
Netflix: 54
Tesla: 152
Palantir: 480
Google (excluding search): 40

This completely excludes the search business, as if it stopped generating any revenue overnight. That obviously won’t happen. Even if we see a slowdown in growth or a decline, search will still generate massive amounts of money, which can be used for significant buybacks—like those seen in the last quarter.

TL;DR: Google is basically a fast-growing company with a PE ratio of 40, plus a “dying” business that’s still going to generate around $50 billion annually for the next five years.

post,1kndhf3,,Is a new classifier needed for electrified CUVs? Here's how they differ in size from their ICE counterparts:,"From my quick look at 10 ICE models and 10 EV (plus Toyota Crown Signia) equivalents, the **electrified** counterparts are (on average) **2.4 inches lower, 2.9 inches longer, and 1.7 inches wider**. I included the Tesla Model Y and did the Mazda CX-5 as its ""ICE counterpart"".

  
These dimensions aren't hugely different on paper, but that's more height and width difference than the current Chevy Trailblazer/Equinox and more in all dimensions than Honda Pilot/Passport. It's a noticeable terms of style and presence. They're obviously more optimized for EV range, while also being in a familiar and friendly CUV shape that buyers are used to and comfortable with.

  
Should we start calling this class of vehicles EUVs or something? It seems like there are 1-2 new ones per year, and they continue to grow in popularity.

Below is the list I used for my comparison.

Robotaxi,Cybercab and Car sales plummet","Now that the future has arrived,  Musk's lies are also being exposed one by one. Have you seen the latest news? On June 19, only a very small number of so-called Cybercabs will be used on the road, and only by invitation, but NHTSA still thinks this is wrong. Musk has not responded to NHTSA yet. What kind of autonomous driving will the so-called Cybercab be and how will it be regulated? Of course, Musk's good friends in the White House may directly ask NHTSA to give up all questions about Musk.

Musk is unfortunate because all the liars have been exposed before him, and he has to face more stringent investor supervision. For example, the protagonist of ""Bad Blood"", a lady who doesn't blink, investors are fed up with boasting but not delivering, and Musk must deliver. But the problem is that once it is delivered, the lie will be exposed.

Without L4 autonomous driving and Robotaxi comparable to Waymo, everything about him is being sniped. Just like when Cybertruck was released, Tesla fans asked me, ""Look, the slap is so fast and strong, call us daddy. Musk is a god."" Because in the previous year, I have been saying that Cybertruck has no market at all, this is a vertical segment. The main scene of Truck is work, not play. And they think that everything I, a dull ITIL consultant and a third-rate business school auditor, say is ridiculous. But after I shouted daddy to everyone in the chat room and accepted their humiliation. In less than a year, Cybertruck sales collapsed. I want to find them on Twitter and let them prove that I am not wrong. But they all said to me, ""Do facts matter? We made money, hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock market returns. Hold on to your truth and go back to Australia. Loser."" Now the same is true for Cybercab. Musk made it, but no one will pay for it.

post,1kqs7zz,,Is this why markets have been not making sense?,"A lot of people have been stumped about why markets have not been making sense. Trump announced tarrifs will go down but tariffs still hurt the economy and somehow the market goes up. 1 country strikes a trade deal and market goes up. Tesla reported terrible earnings then stock goes up. Moody's downgrade of US rating, as well as the largest store in the USA says prices will increase because of tariffs and market finishes positive during the first trading day after the news. None of it makes sense. 

Smart investors are looking to make sense of a stock in order to determine a buy or a sell but literally everything seems unpredictable.. The resounding answer from the community seems to be ""the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent."" and all the other common phrases you hear here. But what if it is being rational? 

I've seen a lot of the blame placed on institutional investors trying to manipulate the market or they don't know what they're doing. ""There's a reason 86% of them don't beat the S&P."" But what if we have been placing blame on the wrong group? 

YTD institutions have taken more money out or bet against the market significantly more than they have put in. AKA, if they controlled the stock market like they used to, the market would be nearly as predictable as we are used to. 

What I think is not being accounted for is the exponential increase in retail investors. YTD retail investors have pumped the market with loads of cash and optimism. Retail has put in significantly more positive cash than institutions have negative. 

Maybe we need to think less about how the market has reacted in the past or what institutions think. But take more of a balanced approach, taking into consideration retail investors.

However I'm not sure from where we would draw this retail investment consideration?

post,1kr1vlf,,CATL goes public in Hong Kong Listing - climbs 16% in debut,"CATL is the world’s leading EV battery maker and a symbol of Chinese dominance in green energy manufacturing. It’s already very profitable. A company to watch closely as EV’s grow. 

From Bloomberg: Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. jumped in its Hong Kong trading debut after the Chinese battery giant wrapped up the world’s biggest listing this year by raising HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion) despite being blacklisted by the Pentagon and grinding through geopolitical storms.

Shares of CATL, as the largest maker of electric-vehicle batteries is known, climbed 16% to HK$306.20 on Tuesday. Though Hong Kong shares of Chinese companies typically trade at a discount to those in the mainland, CATL soared above its stock price in Shenzhen, where it rose 1.2%.

For investors, the allure of buying into a blue-chip stock at the forefront of electric-vehicle technology outweighed the risks of getting caught up in the ongoing turbulence in Sino-US relations. The success of the stock offering, which may increase to $5.3 billion if CATL exercises an option to do so, single-handedly doubled Hong Kong’s proceeds from listings this year and could embolden other companies to go public. 

CATL is “a true champion enabling the energy transition, a symbol of China’s success as a global green leader,” said Karine Hirn, a partner at East Capital Group. 

Priced at around 17 times current earnings multiples, CATL’s Hong Kong shares have room to rise 50%, driven by strong earnings and attractive valuations, said Johnson Wan, head of China industrials research at Jefferies in Hong Kong. 

CATL supplies batteries to top-tier customers such as Tesla Inc., Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co. and Mercedes-Benz Group AG. It has a market share of roughly 38% in electric-car batteries, comfortably ahead of its closest challenger, top EV maker BYD Co.’s 17%, according to SNE Research.

Musk’s comments come after some investors have questioned his dedication to Tesla.

He has been serving as a key advisor to President Donald Trump in leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which has been a major focus for the tech billionaire in recent months. The stock has had a volatile start to the year, and is down more than 12% year to date.

post,1kr9p3w,,U.S. stocks in modest pullback as brief market optimism may be overdone,"Just finished reading today's stock market quotes, and U.S. stocks are finally showing some signs of cooling off.



The S&P 500 and Nasdaq each fell about 0.4%, ending a six-day winning streak. The main reason for this is that everyone was too optimistic about cooling inflation and a temporary cease-fire between the U.S. and China on a tariff deal. Now it looks like that optimism is a bit untenable.



Home Depot earnings report came out, revenue is not bad but profit did not meet expectations, the stock price fluctuation. I'm not sure I buy the idea that prices won't go up. After all, even Walmart is saying they'll have to raise prices.



Tesla continues to surge, Musk said in Qatar, “unless I die”, or will continue to be CEO, the market ate this again.



Bitcoin is also up, breaking $105,000 on the back of stablecoin legislation that passed a hurdle in the Senate.



A lot of tech stocks hit record highs, like Netflix, Uber, Visa, but it kind of seems like they're overdrafting the future.



Jamie Dimon and a number of Fed officials are cautioning not to get too happy too soon, with a rate cut not due until September and trade uncertainty still lingering. You still have to be cautious about buying stocks now, and there could be a major pullback at the first sign of a market flap.

post,1krcrsh,,Tesla's New Self-Driving Ride-Hailing Service – A Game Changer?,"Hey everyone – just saw some big news. Elon Musk announced that Tesla (TSLA) is launching a self-driving ride-hailing service in Austin, TX. It’ll start with about 10 vehicles and scale up to 1,000 within a month. He also mentioned a goal of having 1 million fully autonomous vehicles in operation by the end of next year.

The service will be geo-fenced for safety and allow Tesla owners to rent out their autonomous cars, similar to Uber or Airbnb’s model.

TSLA stock jumped over 3.5% intraday on the news, while competitors like Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) dipped 1–2%, showing how seriously the market is taking Tesla’s expansion into ride-hailing.

If you believe in the long-term potential of autonomous mobility and tech disruption, this might be a major growth driver for TSLA. Definitely something to keep an eye on.

post,1krh3sj,,"Elon Musk says Tesla, xAI expect to keep buying chips from Nvidia and AMD","Elon Musk said Tuesday that he expects Tesla and xAI will continue buying chips from semiconductor giants Nvidia and AMD, and possibly others.

Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, which now owns X (formerly Twitter) has already installed 200,000 GPUs at its Colossus facility in Memphis, the Tesla CEO told CNBC’s David Faber on Tuesday. XAI is also planning a 1 million GPU facility outside of Memphis, Musk said. 

He did not specify how many chips the company had already ordered and by which date they may be installed.

“A few years ago, I made a very obvious prediction, which is that the limitation on AI will be chips,” he said.

Last year, Musk directed Nvidia to send a large order of GPUs to xAI first, jumping the line ahead of Tesla.

At his autos business, Musk said Tesla’s Dojo supercomputer in Buffalo, New York is already used for training its Autopilot and Optimus robotics systems.

Musk boasted on Tuesday that xAI’s Colossus is the “most powerful training cluster in the world right now” with “over 200,000 GPUs training coherently.” Musk’s choice to build in Memphis, Tennessee, was hailed by city officials as transforming the region into a “high-tech manufacturing hub.”

But local communities there have protested the power- and water-hungry operation, specifically the way that xAI has relied on natural gas-burning turbines to help power the supercomputer.

The turbines emit smog-forming nitrogen oxides (NOx), precursors to ozone formation, which have been associated with higher risk of death from respiratory disease.

As CNBC previously reported, environmental advocates say that xAI has likely “violated the Clean Air Act” and local permitting requirements for “major sources of air pollution” with its use of the turbines.

Musk said a Tesla robotaxi service will start with about 10 vehicles in Austin, and rapidly expand to thousands of vehicles should the launch go well with no incidents. To start, Tesla has said its robotaxis will be Model Y vehicles equipped with a forthcoming version of FSD, or full self-driving, known as FSD Unsupervised. Musk said Tesla “will geofence” its robotaxis in Austin to start, meaning the company will limit where those Model Y vehicles can drive. But there won’t be a human safety driver in the cars, Musk promised. Tesla employees will be remotely monitoring the fleet, he said.

I'm living in Germany and picked up my Peugeot E-3008 (with the standard battery – 73.0 kWh net / 77.0 kWh full) back in January. I wanted to share some of my experiences so far after 20,000km. If you have any questions - feel free to ask.

For context, I previously drove mainly BMW and Audi, and I also have about two years of experience with a Tesla Model 3 LR, plus a few months each with a Polestar 2 and VW ID.4 – so those are the benchmarks I’m comparing this car to.

# Overall impression

A high-quality vehicle with an amazing interior and strong pricing, though it has some limitations when it comes to charging in winter.

# 💰 Price & Value

I don’t think many EVs can beat the price/performance ratio of this Peugeot.  
Mine is fully loaded: infotainment, panoramic roof, heated *and* cooled seats front & rear – all for just over €60K in Germany. The hardware quality is on par with VW and Polestar, slightly below Audi, but far above my 2021 Tesla Model 3.

# 🛋️ Interior

I really love it. Everything is super fast – no lag when opening maps or menus. The interface is intuitive, and shortcuts for common functions are easy to access. Took me maybe 5 minutes to get used to, and now I’m a fan. The adaptive cruise control is amazing and the best I have ever had in a car. The side assist is not ideal as the car drives slightly drunk from left to right.

# 🔊 Sound system

I love bass-heavy music – and this sound system is **insanely** loud. Honestly, you can’t even turn it all the way up unless you want your ears to bleed. The bass is punchy; Tesla probably had the stronger subwoofer, but this one comes very close – best I’ve had outside of that.

# ⚡ Charging Speed DC

I usually charge from 5% to 55% on road trips – it goes from \~170 kW down to 100 kW within \~15 minutes. The official 20%-80% in 29 minutes is doable – **in summer, with a warm battery**. Avoid fast-charging in winter with a cold battery – speeds drop significantly, just like with most EVs.",2910,True,1747907419.0,2025-05-22 11:50:19,37,39,OpenCouple1995,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1ksmqw7/peugeot_e3008_review_after_20000km_12500_miles/,True,0.88,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1ktfc9f,,"The Doha interview confirmed that car sales are still Tesla's anchor, and Musk is trying hard to blur this anchor.The crisis is coming quiet","The Doha interview confirmed that car sales are still Tesla's anchor, and Musk is trying hard to blur this anchor. He also hopes that investors will look to ten years later.

As an investor, it is very important to look forward to a better future, because this is the basic concept of investment. However, this does not mean that we only look at the future and not the fundamentals of a company, that is, the main business. Not to mention what if this so-called future is unreliable? This interview can confirm that Saudi investors are very dissatisfied with the sales of his cars, which is Musk's most hated topic. After all, he has said that he doesn't like the car business anymore, and he wants to make cooler Robotaxi, robots, and FSD. And these are all far away.

I know that many Tesla fans have been insisting on proving to everyone how great FSD is. But you know, although many people have shown that FSD can travel 300KM, even across the east and west of the United States without human intervention once. But on the NHTSA registration list, it is L2 autonomous driving. I even wonder why NHTSA allows FSD to be approved without holding the steering wheel. After all, it is only L2 instead of L3 or L4. Of course, this is not important. What is important is that the foundation of FSD today is not enough to support Robotaxi.

I have also met Tesla fans who told me, ""If FSD really doesn't work, at most we can add a lidar, which is not a difficult task."" When I used the logic of business school to analyze it for them, when lidar is added, the competitors will become WAYMO, and WAYMO has been leading for 5 years in using lidar and getting L4, so Tesla will have to catch up.

Tesla fans said contemptuously, ""So what, does WAYMO have a rocket? Can it take us to Mars?""

In the past, Musk could always say Next Year, but when Next Year has arrived, what should he do? Forever Mars plan?

India has electrified 99% of their railway network. It's 75% for china. 70% for France and Spain. 55% for Russia and Germany.

Then we come to electric bikes. They are selling a lot more than electric cars even in USA where there isn't any proper cycling infrastructure.

https://www.bicycling.com/news/a39838840/ebikes-are-outpacing-electric-car-sales-in-the-us/

Trolley buses have existed for decades in many cities. From Moscow to Mexico city.

Electrification of buses with batteries are also a lot more successful than cars.

https://www.sustainable-bus.com/news/bloomberg-new-energy-finance-long-term-forecast-on-electric-buses-vehicles/


 You can have buses with much smaller batteries and use opportunity charging as buses would wait sometimes in terminal any way. Also it's much easier to implement battery swapping for buses than cars. Also in motion charging with trolley bus wires too is possible.

Then we come to resource consumption for cars vs public transportation. Let's take battery needed for electrification. Shenzen has a 100% electric bus fleet. An electric bus would mostly have 500 kWh battery pack. This can be reduced below 100 kWh by opportunity charging (like pantograph charging or battery swapping). Let's be conservative and assume you need 500 kWh battery per bus. And there is one bus per 500 residents in Shenzen. So it comes down to only 625 Wh/person. If they owned cars they would need atleast 15,000 Wh/person assuming one car with 60 kWh battery per a family of 4. This can go upto 60,000 Wh/person or even higher if there's one car per person.

You can also use trolley buses for very busy bus routes. Which would only need a very small battery.

As someone who has lost a significant amount of money shorting Tesla, I'd like to share my thoughts.

**Stage 1: Inception**

> TL;DR: Elon and Tesla capitalized on three key movements: the green movement, cultural status, and visionary leadership of the third industrial revolution.

To understand Tesla today, we need to look back 20 years. Tesla should never have succeeded. There has not been a new car company to sell over 9,000 cars (the DeLorean) in over 100 years before Tesla. Tesla's founders aimed to transform the world by developing an electric vehicle to propel the world toward a green future. Looking for new investments with his PayPal winnings, Elon joined the Tesla team. The founders had a vision and direction, but over time, Elon pushed for continually expanding changes and leveraged his funding and chairman status to execute a Coup d'état to become CEO.

To Elon's credit, it worked. The Roadster was a wild success. Elon leveraged this momentum to convince governments to create billions in long-term subsidies, which enabled them to establish a legitimate foundation as both an industrial power and a strong brand among those invested in the green revolution. He also leveraged this momentum to establish a powerful following of loyal customers who shared his mission and to attract top talent seeking a brighter future.

This also created a flywheel of success: Elon leverages his status to market a new revolutionary dream -> people believe him because of his previous success and the desire for it to be true -> personal or government funding is generated that drives this dream -> Elon forces through objections and doubt -> the dream is partially implemented -> Elon's status as a visionary leader is enhanced.",10221,True,1748006096.0,2025-05-23 15:14:56,32,25,Epicism,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ktjam4/tesla_vision_volatility_and_the_illusion_of/,True,0.74,2025,both,search,False,False,0,

What do you think, is it worth some money left here for 5 years? Or is it safer with SP?  
  
BRK has had a much higher return in recent years.   
The biggest risk is that it currently has a very large amount of uninvested cash. In case that money suddenly withdraws from inside, the price will fall aggressively in my opinion.  
The investment probably presents a little more risk if we take it that way, but it cannot be ignored that frequently while other stocks have collapsed, BRK has continued to grow.  
Many have also trusted this because they usually have wet dreams with Buffett and his direct implication with the company.  
  
Alternatives to these with lower risks if you want faster growth than SP500, I think it would be Amazon which will definitely grow because people keep buying, Tesla with potential but with the risk that it will remain constant and will not go up too much, because their business is going well in the States, but not in Europe at the moment and ... Nvidia which has grown more than it should in the last year, a big collapse is expected in case their AI business does not work out, the only thing that could still lift them.

post,1kum63j,,How bad can it get when crypto goes POOF?,"Right now there is about 3 trillion market cap in crypto, which is making a lot of people feel significantly richer than they are. supposing crypto market cap goes to near zero, I do not think there has ever been a wealth destruction event like that ever in the history of markets. I think it could have significant impacts on the global economy, causing a very real financial crisis.

AI is probably in a bubble as well, there are very obvious stocks at the very least which are beyond reason, such as tesla and Palantir.

These seem to be a staple in the modern portfolio, and could contribute to an even greater loss of the wealth effect.

the wealth effect would further deteriorate as multiple compression occurs across the board in a bear market.

A lot of people will probably pile on here saying that crypto wont go to zero, but factually there is only one use for blockchain technology right now and that would be a CBDC. CBDC would not have anything to do with the current coins which are being treated as ponzi schemes, and would not be related to the likes of tether or USDC. As matter of fact tether and USDC would likely stop existing as liquidity for them would dry up in an event where there is no coins to gamble on outside of them.

Is the next great financial crisis going to play out something like this? and when will it occur? Historically in great bubbles they were nearing an end when political figures were stoking the fire for personal gain. It is not hard to see this playing out right now. A lot of people find comfort that there is greater acceptance of crypto, but in fact it is a sign that the party is nearing its end. History rhymes.

EDIT: I have responded a lot in here, I think that I have clarified a few things with people and would like to change my wording above. Bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme, it is closer to a pyramid scheme or pump and dump.

**Key Takeaways**

* Nvidia's scheduled earnings Wednesday highlight the tech financial reports calendar this week, along with quarterly updates from Salesforce, Marvell Technologies, Dell, and HP. Other noteworthy reports expected include retailers Costco, AutoZone, and Dick’s Sporting Goods.
* Friday’s PCE inflation report will provide insight into price pressure in April, while investors will also be following updates to first-quarter GDP, the U.S. trade balance, and consumer confidence.
* Federal Reserve officials set to speak this week include Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller and New York Fed President John Williams, coming as the Fed is scheduled to release the minutes from its May meeting.

Nvidia (NVDA) earnings and a key inflation report highlight this week’s holiday-shortened calendar as investors continue to evaluate the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and economic policies.

Tech companies Salesforce (CRM), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Dell Technologies (DELL), and HP (HPQ) are expected to deliver earnings this week. Market watchers will also be looking for reports from retailers Costco Wholesale (COST), AutoZone (AZO), Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS), and Temu parent PDD Holdings (PDD).

The reports are set to arrive after a down week for stocks, which was punctuated Friday by a revival of trade-related uncertainty. You can recap last week's trading here.

In addition to Friday's personal consumption expenditures inflation report on Friday, investors will also be tuned into first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) updates and the latest data on the U.S. trade balance and retail inventories. Consumer confidence and sentiment surveys also will be in focus.

Several Fed officials are on the speaking calendar, including Federal Reserve Gov.",7347,True,1748178984.0,2025-05-25 15:16:24,70,4,callsonreddit,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kv2as8/what_to_expect_in_the_markets_this_week_may_2730/,True,0.92,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Yeah, Tesla’s talking a big game with Full Self-Driving, robotaxis, and household robots. Cool stuff, but it's all *future*. Meanwhile, their core EV business? Slipping. Q1 deliveries were the worst in over two years (337k), and they’re losing global market share. Stock's riding on promises

Then there’s BYD. Not as flashy, but they’re dominating China 34% of the NEV market in 2024, $107B in revenue (more than Tesla!), and some insane charging tech (250 miles in 5 minutes?!). Plus, their cars are affordable. Under $10K for an EV? That’s game-changing

Sure, BYD isn’t as far along with FSD, but they’re investing $14B into making smarter cars. And the stock’s trading at a sane valuation (under 27x earnings). Tesla? Still moon-high

Given I've now driven >30,000 miles, it felt like a good time to share the data and because I had it, I also shared comparisons to the Bolt EUV. 

|Measure|2023 Tesla Model 3 RWD|2022 Bolt EUV FWD|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Miles**|30,499|19,912|
|**Total kWh**|9,028|6,547|

|**Average Temp**|49F|52F|
|**Savings ; Tax**\*\*\*|$2,076.44; $437.37|$1,454.89; $279.50|

**SAVINGS**  
*\*I benchmarked the fuel costs associated against my prior car, a Toyota Corolla which got 33.17 mpg over the 100,000+ miles I tracked it, and I also benchmarked against current gas prices, which in my area have been roughly $3/gallon but I am using nuanced* [*monthly averages for my state*](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM_EPMRU_PTE_NUS_DPG&f=W)*. I also bake in a $30 oil change per 5,000 miles as ""fuel"".* 

*\*\*I also calculated the portion of my savings that is due to taxes I'm not paying at the pump (0.285+0.184 per gallon) - which is relevant politically given we can expect a $250/year EV surcharge to attempt to ""close that loophole"", which for me, looks to be ""fair"" if it were state + federal, but just being federal and* combine*d with my state's surcharge ($75), it is not.* 

I have insurance, tabs, depreciation, maintenance, as well but wanted to focus on ""fuel"". Those costs are all higher than the Corolla due to the Tesla (and Bolt) being much newer cars (and fully insured instead of minimally insured) and the heightened costs do offset the fuel-savings for now. I'll be curious to see over 100,000+ miles how the total cost to own tightens up and I expect the Tesla to win out.

post,1kwjdmm,,TSLA: Why I'm still bullish despite the EPS nosedive,"Been holding TSLA since 2021 and just watched their recent earnings with mixed feelings. While everyone's freaking out about the 53% EPS drop, I've been trying to make sense of why the stock is still up 37% over the same period. Either I'm missing something or the market is.

My position: 120 shares @ $187 average (up about 81% total)

The Q1 earnings were objectively bad

EPS of $0.27 vs expected $0.41 (missed by 34%)

Factory changeovers for Model Y killed production numbers

Automotive margins down to 19% from previous highs in the mid-20s

Musk sounding increasingly distracted on the call

Yet I'm still holding and even added 15 shares on the post-earnings dip. Here's why:

The energy business is quietly becoming a monster

While everyone obsesses over car deliveries, Tesla's energy storage business hit record gross profit with 26% margins. My brother works in commercial solar, and he says Megapack orders are backlogged for months. The margins here are substantially better than automotive, and it's growing faster.

I was skeptical about the robotaxi timeline until I saw the Austin test videos. If they actually launch paid rides next month as planned, it changes everything about the valuation model. Even if it's limited geographically, proving the technology works would be massive.

Optimus robot could be the sleeper hit

The Optimus humanoid robot is another wild card that could transform Tesla's business model. They're planning to have thousands of units in production by year-end, ramping to potentially a million units annually by 2030.

post,1kwrt8l,,New 3-row EV comparison,"Below is the summary by Google NotebookLM

* **Kia EV9**
   * **Price:** Starts at $54,900, or basically $55,000, making it the cheapest and best value vehicle in the three-row segment. The as-tested price of the specific model shown was just over $70,000, around $72,000. You can get the Land trim with a large battery pack and dual motor for this price. Leasing is also mentioned as very cheap, around $299 per month with about $2500 down (taxes included in Colorado).
   * **Range:** The video mentions the EPA rated range is put up. The large battery pack is almost 100 kilowatt hours. The range is described as ""not all that much,"" just under 100 kilowatt hours, but considered an ""easy justification"" for the price.
   * **Charging Performance:** Charging performance is noted as being good due to its EGMP platform. The peak charging speed is about 220 kW briefly, but most of the time it's about 200 kW, and it holds this speed deep into the pack, sitting at just about 200 kW up to 80%. This makes it an amazing charging vehicle for road trips. However, it's the only vehicle in the comparison that doesn't natively interface well with the Tesla Supercharger network, getting a maximum of 84 kW currently, though this is expected to increase to 125 kW for model year 2026. It uses an onboard booster for Supercharging and can be buggy.
* **Cadillac Vistic**
   * **Price:** Described as ""quite a bit more money than the Kia,"" starting around $80,000 base, with the as-tested model around $84,000. Higher trims can go up to $100,000.
   * **Range:** Shares the Lyric battery, which GM quotes as 102 kilowatt hours capacity, though it's closer to 105-106 kWh. The battery capacity is only about 10 to 20 kWh more than the smaller Equinox and Optic, which feels like a lot of money for the battery size in a large car.

**Good Time To Buy?**: I believe they're all overpriced right now. Will hedge with UVXY calls buying monthlies, selling against the position creating diagonals at various strikes when there's an upcoming binary event which could be negative catalyst.

I was really excited about the ID Buzz but I’ve realized it’s a failure in the US. Tried to capture why I think it’s failing - can informed folks please weigh in. 

1. Price. The higher trims hit mid $70K and there are just fewer customers in this segment (irrespective of brand, range etc). 
2. Range. For a car starting mid $60Ks, a range of 230 miles is just not acceptable. It’s off by a 100 miles actually. 
3. No incentives. Since this isn’t made in the U.S. Also no special lease deals in the U.S.  
4. Minivans are just not popular, especially compared to SUVs. Doesn’t matter how novel it looks. 
5. Marketing. Unfortunately, there is almost no effective marketing campaigns to promote the vehicle.

post,1kxu7oq,,First-Time EV Buyer's Guide,"I often help people on the weekly General Questions and Purchasing Advice thread, and have been thinking about doing something like this to compile my answers to common questions. I'm going to structure it like a guide for each part of the buying process, but it's more like a collection of my thoughts. I'd be happy to add to it if anyone has anything else to contribute! This is also US-centric (sorry). 

#The Starting Line
So you want to buy an EV eh? Awesome! The process is, in general, very similar to buying a standard internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, but with a few key additional areas of research. I'm going to assume you generally know the basics of ICE vehicle ownership, and make this guide as specific as possible the electric portion of the vehicle purchasing. 

Let me say this up top though if you are on the fence for an EV. If you can charge at home and have a two-car (or more) household, you 100% should make one of those cars an EV. You'll save money on gas and oil changes, and experience the convenience of leaving home with a full ""tank"" every morning. You can get a used Chevy Bolt or Tesla for less than $10k almost anywhere in the US if you qualify for the $4k tax credit, and they're great vehicles that can completely cover 99% of driving needs (and obviously there's plenty of vehicles at higher prices). If that's all you need to hear, go for it. 

# Assess your situation
As always you should buy a car that suits your needs. Trucks for construction work, vans for families, etc. EVs are no different, but you should ask yourself a few additional questions to determine which, if any, EV is right for you: 

* The first, most important question - do you have a place to charge? The main benefit EV owners cite is that the vehicle can ""refuel"" at home, every night. In contrast, the ""worst"" part of the experience is public charging.",15761,True,1748470421.0,2025-05-29 00:13:41,89,53,chilidoggo,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kxu7oq/firsttime_ev_buyers_guide/,True,0.96,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1kxwjdj,,Tesla investors demand Musk work 40-hour week at EV maker as ‘crisis’ builds,"Elon Musk needs to spend more time at Tesla as his electric vehicle company faces a “crisis,” according to a letter on Wednesday from a group of pension fund leaders who manage investments in the company.

“Tesla’s stock price volatility, declining sales, as well as disconcerting reports regarding the company’s human rights practices, and a plummeting global reputation are cause for serious concern,” the investors wrote in a letter to Robyn Denholm, the company’s board chair. “Moreover, many issues are linked to Mr. Musk’s actions outside of his role as Technoking and Chief Executive Officer at Tesla, including his high-profile role as an architect of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).”

The investors want the Tesla board to require Musk to work a minimum of 40 hours per week at the automaker as a condition of any new compensation plan they may arrange for him. They also want a clear succession plan for management of the EV business, and a policy that would apply to all Tesla directors limiting their outside board commitments at public and private companies.

Early last year, the Delaware Court of Chancery ordered Tesla to rescind Musk’s 2018 CEO pay package, which had been worth around $56 billion, finding that Musk controlled the company, and the board’s compensation committee misled shareholders before seeking their vote to approve the plan.

Musk now says he wants even more shares, amounting to 25% voting control of the company.

Tesla’s brand value and reputation have declined since 2024, due largely to Musk’s incendiary rhetoric and political activities. In addition to pouring nearly $300 million into an effort to get Donald Trump back into the White House, Musk formally endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party ahead of the country’s parliamentary election this year.

At DOGE, Musk has led an initiative by the Trump administration to slash federal agencies.",3951,True,1748476658.0,2025-05-29 01:57:38,316,51,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kxwjdj/tesla_investors_demand_musk_work_40hour_week_at/,True,0.94,2025,both,search,False,False,0,

I have a 26 Juniper and 21 Bolt. Obviously, different connectors for charging with NACS and J1772. 

I moved recently and to have a new plug installed outside with my Grizzl-E’s NEMA 14-50 is not recommended without a GCFI breaker. I have decided to sell the Grizzl-E and purchase a Tesla wall connector. 

I regularly charge my Bolt at Superchargers with a A2Z EV CCS1 to NACS connector and also own a A2Z EV NACS to J1772 connector. 

Which way do you think I should go?

1. Tesla Wall Connector with NACS only and then use the A2Z adapter with the Bolt. 
2. Tesla Universal Wall Connector with NACS and J1772. 

Cost difference is $420 vs $650.

post,1kyl4rv,,Question about Tesla Cars,"Hello,

I’d like to start this off by saying that I have this problem where people keep hitting my car. Doesn’t matter if I’m stopped at a red light or just driving in my own lane. Somehow, people keep hitting me. I haven’t been at fault for any of these incidents so far. I’m pretty fed up with this because I’ve had my car for less than one year and it has been hit three times. I don’t even live in a big city. 

So, my question is: will a Tesla alert me if another car makes contact with mine, even if it’s just a really small bump? 

In one of the incidents I had, I was on a busy highway, stopped at a red light. I noticed the person behind me was super close to me but my car didn’t move and I didn’t hear a sound (my window was down) so I drove off. Later I checked and there was a dent in my car where the person hit me.

Do you guys think a Tesla would “help” me with this issue? I just want it to alert me even if the other car barely touched mine.

post,1kyld3i,,New vehicle purchase - check my gas/kWh math please,"TLDR: upgrading from a 35mpg (city) 2nd gen Prius to PHEV or EV, think either one will save us in the long run as gasoline costs increase here in California, but based on my math it is not looking feasible. I need some input if my math needs to account for other factors. 

For context, my wife has a 2007 Prius that's reliable but showing its age. Haven't done much highway driving lately but have been tracking the last few fuel purchases of mostly city driving and it seems to be getting about 35mpg lately. Regular 87 octane is holding at around $4/gallon. So approx 11.4 cents per mile for fuel only (not including maintenance, etc).
Central Valley CA. We are expected to see gas in the $6-8 range within the next 2 years due to refineries shutting down permanently, unless there is some course correction with the political winds.

Our goal in a new vehicle is to upgrade from what we currently have and have a vehicle that is good for long trips. We think PHEV is the ideal candidate. It would allow efficient daily commute use, but still have the engine and tank to take us anywhere on longer trips like we currently use her car or my truck (400-500 mile range) without having to deal with the range anxiety or charging times of a full EV. 

I'm learning to look past the MPGe number and look more closely at the specs, since MPGe is an average formula based on average driver use case scenario. 
Learning to ask: what is the MPG of the gas powertrain that will take us on longer trips, and what is the kWh/100 mile number.

Example a new Kia Sorento or Sportage PHEV have 31/34 miles of EV range respectively, and approx 34-36mpg gas, but a Mazda CX90 has 26 miles of battery range and only gets 26mpg gas. These are just a few PHEV models we have considered. 
Digging deeper, the kWh/100 mile ratings:
Kia Sportage PHEV 40
Kia Sorento PHEV 45
Mazda CX-90 PHEV 58

We do not currently have solar, it is in the future plans, so for now just paying straight PG&E rates on a tiered rate plan.",3710,True,1748550691.0,2025-05-29 22:31:31,1,59,keepcalmandcarryone,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kyld3i/new_vehicle_purchase_check_my_gaskwh_math_please/,True,0.53,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1kylja5,,"⚡ PSA: Can’t Adjust Your Tesla Wall Connector Settings Anymore? Here's How To Fix It (Gen 3, 2025 Method)","**TL;DR:**  
Tesla seems to have quietly killed the web setup process for Wall Connectors. If you're stuck with the “Download the Tesla One App” message at [192.168.92.1](http://192.168.92.1), stop wasting time. Download the *Tesla One* app, select “External Partner,” enter your Wall Connector serial manually, and use Setup Mode (blinking green) to reconfigure your unit.

\--

Alright Reddit — if you’re trying to reconfigure your Gen 3 Tesla Wall Connector (like resetting it or changing the breaker size), and all you’re getting is the “Tesla One App – Partner Access Only” screen at [`http://192.168.92.1`](http://192.168.92.1), here’s what actually worked for me after way too much trial and error. Tesla has changed how commissioning works, and most of the info online is now outdated.

# What You’ll Need:

* Tesla One App (not the regular Tesla app)
* Wall Connector serial number (usually on the back of the unit, behind the cover)
* A Tesla account (yes, even if you don’t own a Tesla)
* Your Wi-Fi password
* A little patience

# Steps to Reset or Recommission:

1. Download the **Tesla One App**
2. Choose **External Partner** when prompted
3. Log in or create a Tesla account
4. Tap: *Installs → Continue → Go to Home*
5. Tap **Begin Install**
6. Choose **Enter Connector Info Manually**
7. Type in your unit’s serial number
8. Put your Wall Connector into setup mode by holding the charging handle button for \~6 seconds until the LED blinks green
9. Tap **Join** when prompted
10. Follow the rest of the prompts:

* Set country
* Adjust breaker size (e.g., 50A sets output to 40A)
* Connect to Wi-Fi

# Quick Note:

I’m not an electrician — just a guy trying not to burn down the garage. My setup was wired to code for a 60A breaker, pulling 48A no problem. But during the county inspection, the inspector flagged it and made us swap to a 50A breaker due to some old local rule about cable length and attic heat.",2283,True,1748551103.0,2025-05-29 22:38:23,32,18,Temporary_Spinach_74,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kylja5/psa_cant_adjust_your_tesla_wall_connector/,True,0.84,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1kyrdrn,,Thinking of buying a used Tesla — need input from long-time owners,"I recently test drove a few Teslas and instantly fell in love. Like many others have said, it completely changes how you view driving.

As much as I’d love to get a brand-new model (especially after experiencing HW4), my current financial situation only allows me to consider something from around 2018–2022 — ideally a 2019 or 2020 model.

So I have a few questions for those of you who own older Teslas:
	1.	Do you regularly use FSD (Full Self-Driving), or is it not really up to par with HW4, making you take over more often?
	2.	How many miles do you have on your car?
	3.	Is the claim that Tesla batteries can last up to 500k miles actually holding up for anyone here?

I know jumping into this might seem impulsive, but the experience genuinely changed my perspective — and the money saved on gas and oil changes is very appealing.

Do you think it’s too early for me to switch now, or should I just wait until I can comfortably afford a new model in 1–2 years?
