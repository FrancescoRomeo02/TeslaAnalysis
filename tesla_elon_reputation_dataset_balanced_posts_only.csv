post,5lukba,,Q4 Deliveries,"Tesla Q4 2016 Production and Deliveries



PALO ALTO, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 01/03/17 -- Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) produced 24,882 vehicles in Q4, resulting in total 2016 production of 83,922 vehicles. This was an increase of 64% from 2015.

Tesla delivered approximately 22,200 vehicles in Q4, of which 12,700 were Model S and 9,500 were Model X. When added to the rest of the year, total 2016 deliveries were approximately 76,230.Our Q4 delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct.

Because of short-term production challenges starting at the end of October and lasting through early December from the transition to new Autopilot hardware, Q4 vehicle production was weighted more heavily towards the end of the quarter than we had originally planned. We were ultimately able to recover and hit our production goal, but the delay in production resulted in challenges that impacted quarterly deliveries, including, among other things, cars missing shipping cutoffs for Europe and Asia. Although we tried to recover these deliveries and expedite others by the end of the quarter, time ran out before we could deliver all customer cars. In total, about 2,750 vehicles missed being counted as deliveries in Q4 either due to last-minute delays in transport or because the customer was unable to physically take delivery. Even where these customers had already fully paid for their vehicle, we still did not count these as deliveries in Q4.

In addition to Q4 deliveries, about 6,450 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the quarter. These will be counted as deliveries in Q1 2017.

Vehicle demand in Q4 was particularly strong. Q4 net orders for Model S and X, which were an all-time record for us, were 52% higher than Q4 2015 and 24% higher than our previous record quarter in Q3 2016.",2236,True,1483478170.0,2017-01-03 22:16:10,90,89,john_atx,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/5lukba/q4_deliveries/,True,0.94,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Jeff Bezos is the fifth wealthiest person on the planet, but he doesn't spend any of his money in my town. Neither does the Walton family. And neither does Elon Musk.  

Increasingly, tech companies have been giving higher priority to their responsibilities to shareholders than to the communities they do business in.  Increasingly, retail workers are part timers who have no employee benefits.  Many companies have engaged in some questionable practices like re-domiciling in Ireland (Accenture, Analog Devices, Amazon.com, Apple Inc., Airbnb, Baltimore Technologies... ) and dubious revenue and expense recognition practices to ""minimize their tax liability.""   Communities compete to provide tax relief to employers ... but that simply shifts the cost of roads, schools, and public safety onto the employees.

post,5oshks,,"Tesla's supply chain is highly dependent on high quality Lithium, Cobalt, and Graphite.","Tesla.  Love em or hate em they're building a giant battery factory, maybe you've heard of it.  Here are some commodities that may expand their business or severely limit their supply chain depending on which way the crystal ball reveals the future.

Every now and then someone with insight mentions the various Lithium mining stocks that will help to feed their Gigafactory. Tesla requires the use of high grade lithium to accomplish their goals, and mines will need to step it up in terms of quality and quantity to maintain supplies.  Also, Graphite and Cobalt are critical minerals needed for building other components in EVs. 

The lithium mines alone are a highly contentious market, and not one (or 5) clear dominant forces seem poised to take control in this space.  It is similarly true of Cobalt that many mines produce cobalt, but there isn't one major player that is in control of the supply, finally the major supply of graphite comes from China at the moment, but some high quality mines are in canada.  All of these minerals are not ready for a sudden increase in demand, unless their supply lines are significantly upscaled and also tailored to meet the quality standards of these soon to be completed gigafactories.

post,5owhq2,,Tesla Upgraded by Morgan Stanley - enjoy the short squeeze,"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/19/morgan-stanley-upgrades-tesla-giving-4-reasons.html

Price target: $305 by Q4 2017. 

Shares are up ~4% in pre-market on this news. 

Morgan Stanley is the first investment bank to upgrade Tesla this year. I expect many banks to do the same as the Model 3 is launching by H2 2017. 

Of course, there is the possibility that Tesla may delay the release of the Model 3, which may prevent it from reaching Morgan Stanley's current Q4 target price of $305. 

However, I doubt that the Model 3 will be delayed any further than Q1 2018, and that is a conservative estimate. I really do think Tesla will get its act together and deliver the Model 3 on time (with a 5% margin of error which translates to +/- a few weeks). 

In the extra long-term, I expect Tesla to reach $500+. It is a ""bubble stock"", and just like how investors played Amazon back a few years ago, I expect the same thing to happen to Tesla. 

Tesla may look overpriced, but it's more than just an auto company. It is an energy solutions company that is transforming both the auto and energy industries all in one-shot. It's very different from investing in traditional auto companies like GM, which offer good value, a dividend but much lower potential growth. 

GM may be rolling out electric cars, but it is years behind Tesla in terms of charging networks and AI. And before you say that other automakers are on-track to manufacture self-driving cars for cheaper with the same quality, remember Tesla is not just an auto company, it is a energy solutions company that is propagating the next revolution in TWO industries, not just one.

post,5qw8wm,,An infrastructure prediction before we find out what The Boring Company is all about. (x-post r/BoringCompany),"Before ground is broken on whatever this tunnel project turns out to be, I wanted to register a guess as to what Elon's BoringCo Los Angeles tunnel could look like.

I think Elon has a long-term plan to help alleviate California's transport woes, all borne of his daily commute in famous Los Angeles traffic, which is most likely a straight line up and down the 405 between Hawthorne and the Santa Monica Mountains. Pending regulatory approvals (which I know nothing about), Elon could start digging from below or beside the SpaceX campus in Hawthorne, in a NW direction mostly inline with the 405. This would pass just west of the Inglewood Oil Field.

Digging could be performed by some new design of TBM that Elon hasn't shared yet, with perhaps additional machinery to expand the tunnel outwards once the initial tunnel has been bored. If he's serious about this idea, which is tough to gauge, then he's probably got an idea or two about how he's going to accomplish it. Don't ask about timelines, though.

In the short term (BoringCo LA v1), once the initial tunnel has been bored, Elon can completely eliminate his personal commute time. As soon as the v1 tunnel, however narrow, passes through the nice neighborhoods in the mountains, he's home free. He can even justify it as being ""in the best interest of humanity"" due to his rapid iteration on systems that improve our collective quality of life. It wouldn't be the whole point of the exercise, but a nice temporary perk. For science.

In the long term (BoringCo LA v2), however, this first tunnel traveling along the 405 through LA would turn into a multi-lane (8? 10? 12? 14? 16?) freeway reserved for swarm-enabled self-driving vehicles. Swarm driving would completely eliminate all bottlenecks (and [paradoxes](https://twitter.",4943,True,1485724985.0,2017-01-29 22:23:05,3,2,BoringCurious,elonmusk,https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/5qw8wm/an_infrastructure_prediction_before_we_find_out/,True,1.0,2017,elon,search,False,False,0,

post,5sq4h0,,"Check out our Electric Supercharger! - No, Seriously.","Backstory: 

We are a couple of students at Olin College of Engineering who love cars and the pursuit of making them go faster. We are currently involved with [Baja SAE](http://www.olinbaja.com) , [FSAE Electric](https://www.olinelectricmotorsports.com), and an offshoot 24 Hrs of Lemons team. Off season, we work at CyPhy Drones and Tesla. Never willing to leave well enough alone, we think that we may have stumbled upon a newfangled way to reliably increase the output of IC engines.

What have we done?

We’ve developed a supercharger utilizing shaft power from an electric motor capable of delivering a static pressure of at least 5-7 pounds of boost. We are in the process of gathering the resources needed for further test results (such as flow rate vs pressure). Before you dismiss the idea outright and click off to another tab, we know you’ve heard the same story before from items like eBay “superchargers” and whatnot that promise the world and don’t deliver anything more than glorified hairdryer. Just give us a chance and you will not be disappointed.

Our Prototype

In a nutshell, we built a system that mates a high-output (~ 7 horsepower @ 100,000 rpm) permanent magnet motor to compressor side of a turbocharger. Full disclosure: It’s currently re-wound BLDC motor with custom spec’d ceramic bearings capable of handling such an ungodly angular velocity. We took the running gear from a Toyota CT-26 turbocharger and re-machined the compressor-side hardware and fabricated a couple custom designed components to mate and seal the assembly. Now, we’re certainly not the first to have attempted this, but in every previous example we can gather, there a couple critical flaws preventing real gains. 1st: Speed. Turbine powered turbochargers spin well into the 100K range, most motors aren’t going to be so happy providing that (for very long, at least!).

Basically, when it comes to how electric vehicles have been presented, there always seems to be a lot of concern that they ""won't charge up to 300/400/500 miles in 2/3/5 minutes"", despite that for such a power-dependent equivalent of ""fuelling"", the power levels required are absurd enough to warrant reliability and cost concerns, **even if the battery chemistry is capable of the lightness, compactness, power, and durability, which we are also assuming in the questions below.**

Just a Tesla-sized 100 kWh (usable) battery pack I am assuming to be capable of between 300-400 miles range at between 3-4 miles/kWh, cruising that is, recharging in 5 minutes, would require a *continuous average* draw of 100 kWh x (60min/5min) = 1,200 kW (or approx. 1,600 hp) eq. of electrical power input, after minor inefficiencies.

So, outside the concept of energy carriers (e.g. hydrogen, synthetic fuels and the largely theoretical sort of metal-air batteries) to offer convenience on a level that would be acceptable to the majority of existing road users whilst minimising the need for education, it would be logical to reduce one of the characteristics to bring things down to a more mundane level: reduce the range so that charging takes less power for the same time, or charge across available larger timescales in certain locales to preserve range.

#So I thought it would be a very good idea to ask the good ol'timers of r/cars to ask this:

*If you couldn't use any other types of car or vehicle for whatever contrived reason, out of the two electrically powered car options, which one of the following three would you choose?*

I can also charge at home and at work.  I had a Tesla 3 Reservation but didn't want to spend $40k+ on a car (once I add what I want to it, I'm sure it will be north of 40k.)

I wanted a Fusion Energi and was going to purchase new when my lease was up, but I found what I consider to be a pretty insane deal--I jumped on it.

I ended up with a 2017 Fusion Energi Titanium with every option except adaptive cruise.  The car itself is flawless.  My commute is ~28 miles each way (56miles roundtrip) and I'm getting an average of 92mpg on that commute.  It's kind of nuts.

Original sticker price was $39900.  I paid $21777 for the car and it was a Certified Pre-owned car through ford, which means I get an additional 12k miles and 12 months of warranty stacked on top of the factory 36mo/36k warranty.  That's 45% off sticker on a 6 month old car with 11k miles on it.

How did I do?

I realize this sort of car isn't for everyone, but if you commute a decent distance it's insanely cheap to operate, drives pretty well, and is comfortable as hell.  Has TONS of tech in it--I was surprised to hear it does wi-fi based updates to the infotainment system if you connect it to your home wifi.

I loved Jaguars, but never really thought I'd be in able to get one, let alone the F-Type R. It just didn't seem disable, even just a couple of years ago.

Picked it up from the dealership last night after getting the financing settled over the weekend. I was literally giddy on the drive to get it. Like that feeling right before a first date - a little nervous, slightly terrified, but very excited.

A couple of things about the F-Type R that the reviews don't do enough justice to:

1. This thing is fast, and loud. Everyone says those things, but you really just don't get it until you sit down in one and floor it. Like, terrifyingly, squeezed into the back of your seat fast. Not as fast as a Tesla, but the fact that it's screaming at you the whole time makes the experience that much more visceral.
2. Visibility is not nearly as bad as people say it is. Yes, the rear window is tiny, so visibility behind you is mostly non-existent. But the side windows are large and mostly free of obstructions. And besides, anything that's behind you is staying there, anyway.
3. The ride is a little hard, but easily tolerable as a daily driver. South Florida is famous for shitty roads, but I found that it wasn't significantly bumper than my MINI countryman.
4. Did I mention how loud it is?

So the moral of the story is dream big. No, bigger than that. Keep dreaming, and it just might come true.

post,5y0v7t,,TSLA about to make a big move. Maybe the last chance to get in before the real Model 3 bull run,"I just did a technical analysis on TSLA stock and I expect a big move (up or down) in the coming days. Reasons why I think this is going to be a big move (50%+) up. 

1. Model 3 is coming up. When Tesla releases its new models, its stock always skyrockets (e.g. +51% for the Model X). 

2. Oil prices are rising. Tesla stock and oil prices are intimately related according to history. 

3. The popularity of Tesla's Powerwall is only starting to kick in for the company. 

4. I expect the new Tesla ""low"" to be around $210, not $180 anymore. However, I would not take chances, and just buy now. 

5. There is a very high chance that Tesla will reach $310+ by the start of 2018 according to the charts. 

6. According to a new report, Tesla's sales growth in China has just doubled. That makes China Tesla's 2nd largest market after the US.

post,5yptnc,,Best Tech Stocks to Buy in 2017,"Tech stocks record the highest potential of growth, which is natural considering the Internet of Things movement and the continuously spreading wireless cloud.I am going to outline a few of the stocks which are my potential investments in various technology branches for 2017.

* Starting with entertainment, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) seems like a worthy stock to buy this year as analysts predict a growth of 24% during this time. What gives Netflix a reliable backing is the subscribing structure. Not only is it increasing exceedingly, but the customers tend to be long term rather than one time buyers.

* As for automobiles, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) shows numerous proofs that this year the company is going to outperform the market. The underlying idea that ensures Tesla a successful year is their open attitude for innovation and revolution. Their new project, the Autopilot, is one of the reasons why I predict an upside. Additionally, their collaboration with Google makes 2017 even more promising.

* The last entry is Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ: ADBE). As last year performance is a crucial metric, we must not undermine Adobe which had a 5.8 billion total income in 2016. However, i would say that ADBE is even more prolific as a long term investment as it tends to show tiny upside and downside fluctuations during the quarter, but keeps an ascending tendency speaking on long run.


In the final analysis, this year is going to be life changing for most of the companies because of the unprecedented political and financial events. That is why I would like to hear more experienced traders’ opinion on the stocks I have chosen.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known for short bursts of activity on Twitter, oftentimes answering fans and reporters questions on the social media platform.

On Friday, as Musk was on a flight to Cape Canaveral—presumably to attend to business related to SpaceX, the aerospace company he also runs—the billionaire entrepreneur shared a number of new details about the Model 3, a video, and even the solar roof tiles Tesla plans to sell.

Here’s what we learned:

First the basics, Musk wanted to clarify that Model 3 is not simply a next version of a Tesla.

He later got more specific about the Model 3 in response to several questions from the above tweet.

- It will have Autopilot capabilities, which has been shared before.
- It will still be awesome. When asked Musk’s reply was “definitely.”
- Musk then added the Model 3 will be like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. “Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot,” he tweeted.
- It should be able to fit a large cooler in the trunk of the Model 3 (a response a concern about trunk space in sedans).
- It won’t contain any significantly new technology that has yet to be introduced to the S or X. Musk says there’s lots of new tech in the design and production process, but nothing “majorly new that a consumer would notice.”
- The shorter wheelbase of the Model 3 only allows for a 75 kilowatt-hour battery pack in Model 3. But, that doesn’t mean it won’t have a greater range than the Chevy Bolt EV, which can travel 238 miles on a single charge.

post,631nux,,Q1 2017 Deliveries,"PALO ALTO, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 04/02/17 -- Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) delivered just over 25,000 vehicles in Q1, of which approx 13,450 were Model S and approx 11,550 were Model X. This was a new quarterly record for us and represents a 69% increase over Q1 2016. Our delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct. Final numbers could vary by up to 0.5%.

In addition to Q1 deliveries, about 4,650 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the quarter. These will be counted as deliveries in Q2 2017.

Q1 production totaled 25,418 vehicles. This was also a new quarterly record for us.

Tesla vehicle deliveries represent only one measure of the company's financial performance and should not be relied on as an indicator of quarterly financial results, which depend on a variety of factors, including the cost of sales, foreign exchange movements and mix of directly leased vehicles.

Musk has already shown how expensive space technology can be run as a private enterprise. 
But just how feasible is his latest endeavour?
Neurotechnology was born in the 1970s when Jaques Vidal proposed that electroencephalography (EEG), which tracks and records brain-wave patterns via sensors placed on the scalp (electrodes), could be used to create systems that allow people to control external devices directly with their mind. 
The idea was to use computer algorithms to transform the recorded EEG signals into commands. 
Since then, interest in the idea has been growing rapidly.
Indeed, these 'brain-computer interfaces' have driven a revolution in the area of assistive technologies – letting people with quadriplegia feed themselves and even walk again.

Neurotechnology was born in the 1970s when Jaques Vidal proposed that electroencephalography (EEG), which tracks and records brain-wave patterns via sensors placed on the scalp (electrodes), could be used to create systems that allow people to control external devices directly with their mind. 
The idea was to use computer algorithms to transform the recorded EEG signals into commands. 
Since then, interest in the idea has been growing rapidly.
Indeed, these 'brain-computer interfaces' have driven a revolution in the area of assistive technologies – letting people with quadriplegia feed themselves and even walk again.
In the past few years, major investments in brain research from the US (the BRAIN initiative) and the EU (the Human Brain project) have further advanced research on them. 
This has pushed applications of this technology into the area of 'human augmentation' – using the technology to improve our cognition and other abilities.",1258,False,1491300116.0,2017-04-04 12:01:56,0,6,MartEden,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/63d6yg/tesla_aims_to_establish_a_direct_link_between_the/,True,0.4,2017,both,search,False,False,0,

post,64828o,,Is Trump slowing the release of new EV models?,"The Chevy Bolt still has limited availability. The Hyundai Ioniq EV is now being released only in California. The Trump administration is likely to reduce the EPA's CAFE standards which essentially require some EV sales to meet future average fleet mileage requirements. It is rumored they may rescind the exception that allows California to set more strict vehicle mileage and pollution standards.

EVs are selling better worldwide but growth is slow in the US. Is the likelihood of regulatory change killing the market for new EVs? Tesla enthusiasm is going strong but other carmakers seem to have slowed their pace. I hope I'm wrong about this. What have you heard? 

**EDIT-** Maybe I'm being misunderstood. I worry that this is true. I keep seeing little stories that point towards trouble, but little or no mention of them on EV forums. Yes, EVs are better technology. I love my '11 LEAF, but I want to have options when the time comes to retire it. without government support we never would have gotten this far, but the tide is turning. Georgia once offered a rebate for EV purchase but now they actually have an additional FEE for registering or renewing an EV. More states are planning to do this.

post,65vp74,,"Tesla ($TSLA) Units, Revenue, and Stock Price projection thru 2025","Over the last three years I posted two models that attempted to look into the future of Tesla and the correlating price.

I've updated the sheet to include all the different changes/events that have happened in the last 3 years to come up with a more inclusive (and complete) projection of TSLA thru 2025 based on the latest guidance from the company. To summarize:

* Tesla is guiding for 500k car units sold in 2018, 1m by 2020 (model reflects a more conservative approach at 80% of guidance).
* Since 3 years ago along with its purchase of Solar City, Tesla has announced new vehicles and products that it will be adding to its catalog. Including Model 3 (mid-size $35k sedan), these are Model Y (mid-size SUV), a Pick Up truck, a Semi Truck, a ""Mini Bus"", a solar roof, solar panels, battery storage, and a ride sharing business. All of these can be found in Tesla's [Master Plan, Part Deux post](https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux).
* Tesla is projecting its Energy division to be as large as its car/transportation division, with an S curve growth (i.e. exponential) in the coming months.

Based on these, I've create a yearly chart of my projected units sold by category, revenue, and expected GM%. Quick note:

* I'm projecting the Tesla Freight (semi truck) and Bus to be a service model, not one where companies are expected to purchase the truck or bus outright (i.e. Tesla becomes a 3PL provider with fully autonomous trucks). I've modeled these on 100% margin on an expected profit amount that I think they'll be able to draw from each unit on a yearly basis.
* I have no idea what the per-unit price of the storage business extrapolates to, so I attempted to model it based on a % of total business. Don't pay too much attention to the unit figures under the storage business.

I'm setting a price target of $733 using 2021 figure for revenue of $91.7bn. You can use this same exercise for any of the figures on the model (i.e.",2582,True,1492437592.0,2017-04-17 15:59:52,231,174,farzyness,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/65vp74/tesla_tsla_units_revenue_and_stock_price/,True,0.82,2017,both,search,False,False,0,

So without further ado, from an event organizer I emailed:

> Elon Musk didn't give a talk, but just gave the interview with our CEO Chris Anderson. It covered such a wide range of topics  – really fascinating stuff, and put a cap on the conference's theme, The Future You. The atmosphere in the auditorium was electric!

Anyway these are the possible ways to watch the interview with Elon at TED 2017, soonest to longest from now:

* 1) Someone posts an unofficial version online given Elon's high profile. I think this is somewhat unlikely since TED runs a tight ship but who knows

* 2) [TED Cinema Experience](https://tedcinema.com): **This Sunday**, many theaters will be showing a $17 2-hour highlight reel from TED 2017. The interview with Elon is specifically mentioned in the description and about half of it will be shown. From the description on TED Cinema: *""The program will include a new interview with Elon Musk about what an exciting future looks like, among other inspiring and insightful TED Talks and performances from the week""*

* 3) [TED Live](https://tedlive.ted.com/webcasts/2017): Available for viewing **June 7th**, Pay $25 to watch all of TED 2017 Day 5 including Elon's interview. This is the only thing that I'm sure will definitely be the entire 30 minute interview

* 4) [TED YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/TEDtalksDirector): Wait until it is posted publicly on the TED YouTube channel. This is expected to have a delay of about **5 to 6 months from now** based on the delays of TED 2016 and it's not guaranteed to be the full thing or even be uploaded at all. It's likely but some TED speakers never make it to the channel

# 1. What's Delphi do?

Delphi Automotive is a global technology company serving the automotive sector. The Company designs and manufactures vehicle components, and provides electrical and electronic, powertrain and active safety technology solutions to the global automotive and commercial vehicle markets. 

If you look at their client list... it's a who's who of the auto market and only one customers is over 10% of sales, GM. For 2016 the split was: GM 14%; Volkswagen 8%; Ford 6%; Fiat Chrysler 5%; GM China 5%; Daimler 5%; Peugeot Citroen 5%; Hyundai 3%; Geely 3%; and Toyota 2%. Though I wonder why there is no Renault, Honda, BMW or Tesla? Suppose you can't serve everyone!

From a sales perspective its 37% North America, 2% South, 35% Europe&MEA and 26% Asia-Pac. So perhaps there's room to grow in Asia?

## How are they doing, number wise?

At first look the data looks nice, but that is partially 'cos of a big acquisition in Dec 2015 and another in Oct 2012.

|EPS | $4.59 | $5.06 | $4.48 | $3.89 | $3.33|

Management themselves are very happy to offer up ""Adjusted"" figures ignoring discontinued operations, papering over restructuring costs, one-off project costs, etc, etc. I hate that...but for now, let's park that concern.

post,6eh8no,,More expensive to use electricity for plug-in hybrid?,"I have a Toyota Prius Prime rental this month and just doing some quick math, I think it's more expensive to run the car on electricity than to just put gas in it from an ***energy consumption standpoint***.

I live in the SF Bay Area and PG&E ranges between $0.17 and $0.50/kWh for residential rates and public charging stations are similar or $1/hour. The Prime takes about 2 hours on a Level 2 charger and 5.5 hours on a Level 1 charger. Based on a battery capacity of 8.8kWh and an average range of 22 miles, it comes out to between $0.068/mile and $0.20/mile depending on where I plug in. Gas is averaging about $3/gallon as we head into summer and assuming hybrid-only average of 50 MPG, it comes out to $0.06/mile. 

I understand that the EV-only mode is much more efficient at 133 MPGe, but what bothers me is that I would be paying more than twice for the same amount energy in terms of [gallon of gasoline equivalent] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline_gallon_equivalent) at $5.678/gallon and up. 

Is there an error in my math or am I overthinking this? I'm excluding free destination charging (e.g. parking garages, etc.) because at this point they seem to be the exception rather than the norm. I have a reservation for Tesla Model 3, but it seems like it might be significantly higher in terms of fuel costs.

In terms of the car itself, the Prime is way better than the regular Gen IV Prius. I took it up to Mount Tamalpais over the weekend with some friends and it handles the curves on Highway 1 surprisingly well, remaining planted even with three people on board. It's definitely not a BMW, but I think the heavier weight of the battery pack helps make it feel more solid. Overall, the reaction I've gotten from a lot of people is more ""wow"" instead of the ""ew' I got from the normal Gen IV Prius. The front of the car reminds me of the new NSX and the Hypersonic Red color looks amazing compared to the dull gray and silver cars featured in press shots and reviews.",2115,True,1496258239.0,2017-05-31 21:17:19,8,13,roflowhale,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/6eh8no/more_expensive_to_use_electricity_for_plugin/,True,0.99,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

# 1. What do they make?

Magna International is a global automotive supplier, HQed in Canada with over 300 manufacturing plants and sales in 30+ countries.

The Company's products include producing body, chassis, exterior, seating, powertrain, electronic, active driver assistance, vision, closure, and roof systems and modules, as well as vehicle engineering and contract manufacturing. 

* The US and Canada is over 50% of sales where their clients include BMW, Daimler, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai-Kia, Mazda, PACCAR, Renault-Nissan, Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen. 
* Europe's over 30% of sales and there's a similar list of clients, but also includes Geely, PSA Peugeot Citroën, Renault-Nissan, and Tata Motors.
* In Asia they serve the usual suspects, and: Chery Automobile, First Automobile Works, and Great Wall Automobile.

So it's a who's who of the motor industry! 

But let's compare there concentration of sales with global sales:

|Metric|% of Magna sales|% global share|
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|GM | 20% | 8% |
|Ford | 16% | 7% |
|Fiat Chrysler | 15% | 5% |
|Daimler | 12% | 2% |
|Volkswagen | 10% | 11% |
|BMW | 10% | 3% |
|Others | 17% | 63% |

In fact, despite the client list they are way behind in sales to five of the top 10: Toyota, Hyundai, Nissan, Honda and Suzuki. Not a surprise given the small sales % in Asia. Perhaps, here lies the biggest opportunity?

And if we look at the recent performance, the top line's pretty rocky, though that does include a major disposal in 2015.",6245,True,1498590732.0,2017-06-27 21:12:12,47,6,shane_stockflare,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/6juzju/stockaday_is_magna_electric_mga/,True,0.89,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,6lk733,,Why I believe July is make or break for Tesla,"Sorry this is my first post on reddit so please delete if you guys believe it does not belong here.

After following Tesla since 2015 I believe this month is the most crucial for them, stock wise. Tesla's overarching goal was to make electric cars affordable, which would be possible (somewhat) with the Model 3. July is when the Model 3 will slowly reach the consumers, but will it be enough to wow us. I believe the reason that the Tesla Model S and X didn't quite hit the analysts' numbers was because people are holding off and waiting for the Model 3. Ultimately, Tesla wants us to love the Model 3 so much that we will buy into the whole Tesla ecosystem. If the reviews rave about the Model 3, stocks are sure to rise.

Tesla is like Apple in a sense where their technologies technically work with third party items but who would risk it? Would you buy a third party macbook or iPhone charger if that charger could potentially kill your product? No, of course you'll buy the manufacturer's chargers. And if Tesla is so good at making electric cars, wouldn't that be the case for their batteries and solar roofs too? I'm sure people will be sold on that idea. Their houses would basically be Tesla branded at that point, with Tesla solar tile roof, Tesla house batteries and a Tesla in the garage. I'm sure it'll sync up nicely, almost like your iPhone on a Mac.

Now what if the Model 3 release failed and was filled with issues? Orders will surely drop, people who have already deposited money will surely back out when they believe it is a poor investment. The idea of the Tesla ecosystem will be ruined (maybe saved by Model Y?), stocks will surely plummet as people lose interest. 

Tesla is the company that made electric cars cool, they shook the automotive industry forcing them to make EV varieties as well. And if the Model 3 surpasses expectations, I'm sure it will replace all other vehicles in that price range. It will be the ""Not your daddy's entry level luxury sedan"".",2300,True,1499325728.0,2017-07-06 09:22:08,3,8,HungryPotatoe,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/6lk733/why_i_believe_july_is_make_or_break_for_tesla/,True,0.57,2017,both,search,False,False,0,

2. [A gallon on petrol produces 20 pounds of CO_2](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/contentIncludes/co2_inc.htm) !!!
3. The means the VW Golf does 0.56 pounds of CO_2 / mile.
4. [Tesla P100D does 315 miles on 100KWh, or 0.32KWh/mile](https://bgr.com/2017/01/20/tesla-model-s-vs-model-x-100d-range/).
5. [The average CO_2 output of US electrical grid is 7.03 × 10^-4 metric tons CO2 / kWh](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gases-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references) or 1.5 pounds/KWh.
6. Therefore the amount of CO_2 equivalent a P100D outputs or 0.49 pounds of CO_2 / mile.

* VW Golf: 0.56 pounds CO_2/mile

* Tesla P100D: 0.49 pounds CO_2/mile

As the grid gets greener (e.g. replace Coal with Gas, more renewables, etc) the amount of CO_2 equivalent for the Tesla drops. But for now, on average, the big P100D is about as dirty as the small VW Golf, which is way way dirtier than I expected.

If the Model 3 does 215 miles on 50KWh battery (we don't know for sure yet), it'll output 73% of the S' CO_2, or 0.36 pounds CO_2/mile, which is 36% cleaner than the VW Golf. Only 36% cleaner.

Note this calculation neglects the CO_2 ""price"" of collecting and refining petrol, as well as the CO_2 ""price"" of collecting coal & gas for the grid.",1474,False,1499634620.0,2017-07-09 23:10:20,0,21,shaim2,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/6m9zyi/i_did_the_math_was_surprised_on_the_current_us/,True,0.41,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,6n7e3h,,True Value Investing: Dividend Payout Ratio,"The dividend payout ratio (DPR) is the percentage of net income that is paid out as dividends to shareholders.

In order to calculate the true value of a stock, you should examine the dividend payout ratio of the company and industry historically. 

Ex. Apple in 2016. Gross profit, 82.72B. Net profit, 45.69B. Dividends, 12.3B paid out to 5.39B shares; 2.28 per share. That amounts to a dividend payout ratio of about 27%.

Combine your predicted dividend payout ratio with your predicted net earnings of the company to calculate your estimated holding return on the stock. This is where a lower EPS is not so bad if the expected DPR is excellent. Accordingly, a higher EPS on a strong company is not so good if their expected DPR is poor.

Ex. Tesla stands today at a stock price of $323 with an outstanding share count of 164M. Taking Ford Motors' 2016 earnings/dividend performance as a benchmark, suppose that Tesla reaches a similar net profit and dividend payout ratio in 10 years. Then, Tesla's 2026 projected net profit of 4.6B with a 30% DPR yields $8.4 per share (paltry 2.6% true return value).

post,6nrov8,,Open request to the electric vehicle industry: Make us an electric 4wheel drive.,"Hello. 

I am a motoring enthusiast. I fit into a relatively large niche of the motoring enthusiast community in that I am mainly interested in off-road driving. Although I enjoy watching car races; F1's, V8 Supercars, top fuel drag races, drift races, I even geek out a bit on the big street rods and I don't mind going to car shows and show'n'shine events, I don't own a big horsepower car and I probably never will. The main type of motoring I am about is off road driving. I LOVE the sense of freedom you get when you just turn off the side of a road and hook into the bush, or cruising over wide open sand dunes. I love seeing how far I can get. I love conquering mountains, even if it means I have to park up somewhere in the scrub and hike the rest of the way. I love getting stuck and having to pull out the winch. I love off-road touring, to me its the purest form of motoring - taking the freedom that *having* a motor vehicle gives you to the absolute extreme. Club events, hanging out with a bunch of other like minded people/families, cooking up a barbeque somewhere out in the wilderness, a secluded swimming hole that not many people ever get to see. Its really incredible. My point is, I love motoring, but I don't really care about going fast. 

Some of you might have seen the post on the front page recently about the Top Gear crew scripting/manufacturing a breakdown of the Tesla Roadster without even ever having seen or driven it ... As a motoring enthusiast I was not surprised at all by this. Appalled yes, surprised not in the least.. In the community circles of which I am a member, electric vehicles aren't cool. But not only are they not cool, the advent of electric vehicles is seen as somewhat of a threat to our lifestyle. 

Me personally, I don't see EV's as a threat to my lifestyle, because what I'm into is a bit different. I don't care so much about the grunts and rumbles you get when you open up the carby on a big V8.",5451,True,1500278197.0,2017-07-17 09:56:37,21,28,petehehe,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/6nrov8/open_request_to_the_electric_vehicle_industry/,True,0.95,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,6op4w4,,Investing Philosophy,"For the past year, I've been building a new web application that tracks and analyzes my stock portfolio.  I know there are a lot of tools out there, but I've never really loved any of them.  So I set out to build my own.  The thing is, it's based on my investing philosophy, and I'd like to get your feedback on my philosophy because that will help shape the web application as I continue to develop it.  Please read on...

As a personal investor, every time you invest money in the stock market, you essentially choose one of two options:

Option #1 is to find a great company and purchase some stock.  You monitor the company and decide when to sell based on company performance, market conditions, changes in leadership, the company’s financials, and so much more…  Generally, that’s us – we are personal investors.

Option #2 is to simply buy a low-cost index fund or ETF that guarantees a return essentially equal to the market or whatever benchmark you choose (most commonly the S&P 500).

Why do some people choose option #2?  It turns out, those benchmarks outperform most mutual funds and many individual investors, and they don’t require any of the work involved in managing your own portfolio! 

So, here’s the thing: it’s easy to buy shares of an index fund or ETF and match the market’s returns (letting your portfolio grow on autopilot) but it’s quite difficult to actually beat the market. 

Nevertheless, that doesn’t stop us individual investors from finding that diamond in the rough…that next great company that will change the world, crush its competitors, and enrich our personal portfolios.

*My point is this:  Individual investors are not just trying to make money.  The goal is to make more money than what an index fund or ETF would return...the goal is to beat the market.  We want validation that all this hard work is paying off, that we're making the right decisions, and we are indeed outperforming the S&P 500 (or whatever benchmark you prefer).",2393,True,1500655479.0,2017-07-21 18:44:39,2,7,BuckM11,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/6op4w4/investing_philosophy/,True,0.75,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Or will the car just become a commodity that can be disposed of every few years? Depending on answers, i might process various bits into an article.

post,6sfy6v,,"Could ""Elon"" be a popular baby name in the near future?","Let's assume for a second that Elon achieves all his ambitions. Humanity begins to colonize Mars, everyone has neural laces, and we're all whisked around in a combination of self-driving cars, Hyperloops, and electric jets. He becomes the world's richest man and secures a his place in history, beloved by all.

-----

My question is whether his name could catch on as a popular baby name near or after the end of his life. There's been increased popularity from fictional characters (Elsa from Frozen) but I'm not sure any real person has ever caused a *significant* increase in baby name popularity, especially an industrialist or entrepreneur. Maybe I'm just not thinking about it enough but it seems like most names of admirable historic figures are either generic enough that you wouldn't know who they were named after or antiquated.

Elon, though biblical in origin, is short and iconic and I could see it catching on. The only non-celebrity real-life example I can think of is Hitler but that kind of had the opposite effect...

post,6sgrpq,,Tesla S South Carolina Delivery Experience,"I also posted this on TMC, thought it might be useful for anyone in SC since we don't have a dealership and there are some nuances that are different from a traditional car purchase.

I received delivery of my 2017 S75 RWD late last week and wanted to share my experience for anyone in South Carolina that may be looking at purchasing a Tesla. Despite having some large metropolitan areas, South Carolina does not have a Tesla dealer (gallery or service center). I'm not sure why this is but it may be due in part that BMW has a huge manufacturing presence here or it may be about the direct sales model....there are far more educated people on that topic and that isn't the purpose of my post. I am only speculating.

I spent the majority of my adult life begging my wife to let me get the Model S and eventually I won out. She pressed the button to confirm the deposit online, and told me that in her mind she was buying my silence. By that she meant that now that we are actually getting one, I can no longer give her a Tesla fact every chance I get nor can I ""inception"" her by making her watch youtube videos about how awesome they are right before we fall asleep each night. 

Anyways, I have been a Model 3 reservation for over a year but I kept coming back to the Model S. In my own personal opinion, I like the fact that the S has been around for several years and assumed they have worked a lot of the kinks out. I personally believe Tesla will change the world with the Model 3 but there's something to be said for the look and the size of the S as well as its long production history. I initially went with a custom build S 75, red with no PUP black leather and the subzero package. I place the deposit in late June and the delivery date was late July. I was good with this because I know they're trying to focus on the model 3 and what's another month when you've been dying to have one for years?

The odds are stacked against the fact that we’ll be doing in 20 years what we are doing today. Do you remember the days before the internet? It was legit, 20 years ago! When was the last time you saw a horse and buggy or an employed horse shoe maker. We hear the myth of the coal miner, but I know a hell of a lot more opportunities in solar.
Can you imagine the technology we’re going to have in 20 years? We won’t have to drive our own cars. Do you think that is unbelievable? My buddy’s Tesla already drives itself! Tesla is planning to release a semi-truck in the next few years. Are you a professional truck driver? I’d start training for an alternative career now so you are prepared when it happens.
That’s the point I want to address in this article. In order to be prepared for the future, you have to prepare for the future! Coal miners know they are getting regulated out by two factors. The first is that there is a massive consumer shift happening today with the market place demanding more renewable options as the price continues to decrease. The second is that you are digging up a natural resource that there is only a finite amount of. I mean, you are already blowing up mountains to get what you need. How long can we do this before we can’t? In a world where nothing is infinite, we should prepare ourselves in the event that finite happens. We lose a job. Our skillset isn’t one that is required anymore in the marketplace. We’re getting out paid, out played and overstayed by some kid out of school that’s more in touch with what the consumer generation wants and needs.
This is why, the most important skill you can teach yourself in life, is how to learn. Meta-learning.",6497,True,1502243763.0,2017-08-09 03:56:03,2,0,jessehendon,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/6sic6u/its_not_what_you_know_but_what_you_can_learn/,True,0.67,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,6squec,,My electric-car fanboy father is having even more fun driving my fart-canned Honda than I am!,"Last weekend, [I bought a 1993 Honda Prelude SR-V](http://imgur.com/a/3D3QB) as a cheap daily with some character for my upcoming years in school. Insurance was killing me on my 08 Civic despite a perfect record, and the Prelude, being older, is better in that regard.

I was pretty pleased with the purchase, everything seems in order and there doesn't seem to be any major issues considering it's a 24-year old Honda, most of which have lived tough lives. I'm working on an island without use of a car, so it's parked at home for the summer. My dad, however, is even more pleased with my purchase.

See, about 25 years ago he had just graduated from university with a bachelors in computing science and decided to treat himself with an upgrade from his 1979 Pontiac Sunbird. He was comparing the Toyota Celica and the Honda Prelude, and ended up buying a Celica as it was more practical. The Prelude continued to be his ""dream"" for some time.

Fast forward to today. My dad isn't a huge car guy per se, although I am thankful he puts up with my constant drivel about cars. He enjoys alternative energies as a hobby and was one of the first Tesla Model S owners in Canada. [So imagine my surprise when I get this set of images from him.](http://i.imgur.com/LmozdU0.png)

He plans to take my car in to work a few times while I'm away to ""keep the battery charged"" and I feel is just having a blast, making me miss a nice back road even more. [My mom isn't having as much fun on their excursions.](https://streamable.com/drklu)

1.) You buy a 2 TB hard drive but only have access to 1.5TB and have to pay an extra $10 to get access to the whole hard drive.

2.) My car has a 21 gallon tank.  What if they decided to put a spacer in it to limit how much gas I can put in to like 18 gallons.  If I pay them $2000 they will remove the spacer.

The synergies in this deal now seem obvious. And the financials of the deal are unclear. However,  one can only begin to imagine Big Hairy Audacious Goal (BHAG) synergies in other areas too; aassuming the deal consultants are able to sell it to corporate executives:

- A hotel giant like Mariott, Wyndham or IHG buying AirBnb?

- Rental car giant like Hertz or Avis buying Uber?
  
- General motors buying Tesla?
  
- IBM buying Google’s cloud division?
  
- others…..?

* 2014 60kWh Model S listed for $50,600
* Grey Metallic Paint
* All glass pano roof
* 19” Silver Cyclone Wheels
* 19” Michelin Primacy Tire Upgrade
* Free supercharging
* Smart air suspension
* Subzero weather package
* Black Nappa Leather w/ Piano Black
* Tech Package

Things I didn’t expect but were included on delivery

* Parcel Shelf
* Parking sensors! I thought I read the early 2014s didn’t have these. Mine does

**Ordering**

After last week’s announcement that it would be 6-8 weeks until non-employees could start designing their Model 3s I somewhat impulsively decided to buy a used Model S instead. I found a 2014 S 60 in LA with no transportation fee to San Diego. Upon ordering my sales advisor told me that the car had already completed reconditioning and was ready to be transported to San Diego. After that initial interaction he didn’t respond to any of my questions throughout the week. My delivery specialist was great though.

**Financing and Insurance**

I financed through Tech CU. I got quotes from my local credit union and a few others but their terms were the best. My insurance is going from $60 per month (old Honda with no collision coverage) to $190 per month.

**Fees and Down Payment**

The DMV fees were a little higher than expected. Sales tax and registration fees were an additional 9.2% on the sale price. For the down payment, I was happy to learn I could make multiple payments from a few online savings accounts. I had been saving for my Model 3 in an Ally account with 1.2% APY and recently transferred some money to a CapitalOne 360 account to collect a sign up bonus. Once the delivery appointment was scheduled the payment option was available and I paid on Wednesday.

**Delivery**

I put together a detailed checklist to go through during delivery.",4403,True,1508026234.0,2017-10-15 02:10:34,22,4,GreenBSTRD,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/76frgb/my_cpo_experience_and_home_charging_installation/,True,0.85,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Full text below :
> This was supposed to be Tesla’s moment of triumph. The California electric car company had confidently predicted it would be pumping out 5,000 of its mass market Model 3 vehicles each week by the end of 2017. That volume would allow it to move out of its high-end niche and compete head to head with traditional automakers.

> Instead, Tesla has been beset by a series of production snags — some workers are having to build battery packs by hand, parts have been delayed because of late design changes, and production lines are frequently halted for quality inspections. As a result, it was only able to produce 260 Model 3 vehicles in the third quarter, and has pushed back its 5,000 car per week goal to the end of March. The company also reported a bigger than expected third-quarter loss.

> Tesla insists that these are merely teething problems as it remakes car manufacturing from the ground up. “There are no fundamental issues with Model 3 production or its supply chain, and we are confident in addressing the manufacturing bottleneck issues in the near-term,” a spokesman said.

> The company proudly noted that some of its manufacturing lines — including the seat assembly and paint shop — have “demonstrated a manufacturing ability” to handle 1,000 cars a week, and others have demonstrated “burst builds of about 500 a week”.

> That still puts its factories in California and Nevada a long way from 5,000 cars a week. Although deliveries of the high end Model S and X are up, the company recently removed references to scheduling test drives from its Model 3 information page. That suggests that it will be a long time before ordinary drivers get anywhere near a Tesla electric car.

> Tesla counters that focusing on production numbers misses the point because it is more than “just” a carmaker.",4675,True,1510311701.0,2017-11-10 12:01:41,121,87,quodo1,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/7c0fx6/tesla_risks_being_overtaken_by_the_competition/,True,0.81,2017,both,search,False,False,0,

In Tesla fashion, the truck is a sharp departure from the industry’s norm. The cabin is spacious enough for a driver and passenger to stand.

It is flanked by two laptop-size video screens providing navigation and scheduling data as well as images from blind spots and other areas around the truck.

It will be equipped with radar sensors, cameras and processors to enable drivers to use a version of Autopilot, the advanced driver-assistance system featured in Tesla cars such as the Model S and the new Model 3.""

post,7du8rv,,Get me up to speed on investing in TSLA,"I am not super educated on the Tesla-sphere and, I'm not in the shipping industry, so some advice from ""experts"" there would be appreciated. I was doing my research, and noticing the dip in price after I saw the Semi announcement. Now, when I saw that I was stunned as I'm sure many of you were. I immediately think to myself, this will change the world entirely. [Then I saw that Walmart will be ordering 15 units for testing](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/17/wal-mart-says-its-planning-to-test-teslas-new-electric-trucks.html) and got even more interested. I knew I had wished I invested in TSLA long ago before I started investing a little bit of money, and I simply could not afford to. Now with this release, I just wonder how this could NOT be the future? With the benefits listed, I can't imagine why a company wouldn't want this truck, as it is currently today. The cost savings alone seem to ensure that this is not only the best truck you can buy.. but possibly the cheapest truck you can buy. It appears possible that this could reduce shipping costs up to 50% (truck costs).

Then I read about their **[production problems](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16627528/tesla-perbix-acquisition-automated-factory-machine-builds-machines), [their missed deadlines with feature releases](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/24/16504038/tesla-autopilot-self-driving-update-elon-musk), and [financial issues](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16593582/tesla-model-3-production-q3-largest-quarterly-loss).**

If this semi is the gift from the gods it appears to be, perhaps that would solve their financial issues, but could they even produce them with the production issues they are having today?

post,7eb7hg,,Congratulations to Elon for two more successful crowdfunding campaigns. Are they worth it? [Discussion topic],"The Model 3 reveal generated $450 million in interest-free micro-loans from future customers with minimal transaction costs (credit card processing fees, reveal party, Tesla store staffing) and with lenders receiving priority upon delivery of the finished product. 

The biggest difference between that phenomenal outreach and a crowfunding campaign such as those managed by Kickstarter, Indiego or [a few dozen](https://www.inc.com/magazine/201306/eric-markowitz/how-to-choose-a-crowdfunder.html) other sites? No middleman. 

The success of the Model 3 campaign has been repeated with the Powerwall and the Solar Roof.  And now, the recent Semi and Roadster2 reveal came bundled with at least two new crowdfunding campaigns ... three if you count the two Roadster2 options as being distinct.  At $5K per BAMF semi, Meijer (4), Walmart (15), and JB Hunt (several) have plunked down more than $1 million of seed money so far.  It takes only four Founder's Edition reservations of the Roadster2 for it to hit the million dollar level.  

And yet, there are still liabilities and risks from this sort of activity.    
 Is this just the new way of doing business?  Is it sustainable? Someday, a proposed product is going to fail to come to fruition ... what happens then?  Does crowdfunding carry class-action or other risks that remain to be seen?

Over the past 12 months, the electric-car maker has been burning money at a clip of about $8,000 a minute (or $480,000 an hour), Bloomberg data show. At this pace, the company is on track to exhaust its current cash pile on Monday, Aug. 6. (At 2:17 a.m. New York time, if you really want to be precise.)

To be fair, few Tesla watchers expect the cash burn to continue at quite such a breakneck pace, and the company itself says it’s ramping up output of its all-important Model 3, which will bring money in the door. Investors don’t seem concerned. Tesla shares rose almost 3 percent to $317.81 Tuesday, giving it a market capitalization of $53 billion. Ford Motor Co. is worth $48 billion.

But still, its need for fresh cash came into high relief last week when Musk unveiled his latest plan to raise funds. He’s asking customers to pay him upfront to order vehicles that may not be delivered for years.""",1227,False,1511312566.0,2017-11-22 02:02:46,17,38,pscoutou,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/7emvkz/teslas_burning_through_nearly_half_a_million/,True,0.65,2017,both,search,False,False,0,

He looks a cool guy, but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVOJ88id-yo) really demostrates the cognitive dissonance that many ICErs have to the electric vehicle. In some moments, he's sometimes salty about the affair and hates on Tesla. But in other moments, he's loving the new Roadster. It's a surreal mix of love and hate. I've taken some of the juiciest quotes and posted them here for your reading pleasure!

----------

""It's just the annoying things that the people that buy Teslas buy them for power and think they have the fastest car, which now they do - they have the quickest car if you do buy it. I don't know, I kind of feel like it's gonna bring this kind of nerdy side to the car community""

----------

""I think it will destroy the car community sadly""

----------

""Does a quarter mile in 8.8 seconds which is absurd and I am honestly so shocked.""

----------

""<Raves about Mercedes Project One $2.7M hyper car for half a minute> ......... and the top speed of that doesn't even compare to the new Tesla. This kills me."" (250+mph versus 217mph)

----------

""As a car person, I've always hated Tesla but I do approve of this car, but it's really taking the characteristics of a car away""

----------

""But I think there won't be really any hyper car production in the next few years because this is such a setback since the 0-60 time <of the Roadster> is almost unbeatable without illegal mods""

----------

""So I feel bad for you guys that are in hyper cars or the car enthusiasts or the car community. I feel bad because this is gonna have to show that the car community's gonna have to come together. Gas cars have to come back and beat them. We don't know.""

post,7gg0s4,,Could the Tesla Roadster 2 have a KERS for fast launch,"I was reading a paper on Flywheel Energy Storage Systems (http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/8/10/10636/pdf) and got to thinking about maybe the Roadster 2 uses an F1 type KERS for fast launches.

It would not add much weight and it would enable Tesla to protect the battery from heavy current draws. The KERS could be spun up again either by the battery or from regenerative braking. Flywheels can deliver their power very rapidly for the boost. 

Finally, it would allow Tesla to build the 1.9s car using today's technology. Porsche, Audi, Jaguar and Volvo have already deployed these systems in race cars (as a hybrid not full electric).

post,7gy8hq,,Thoughts on electric super cars,"Posted a comment in the tesla subreddit, thought it worth exploring here too.

There's a lot of hype / discussion around the Tesla roadster recently, both positive and negative.  But its a car that's not going to go into production until 2020 and we don't know anything about it other than straight-line characteristics.  

The NIO EP9 has actually lapped the nurburgring completely, and done at 6:45 (albeit with slicks).  It did it in early 2017 and its (albeit limited production) ""available to the public"".

I guess my point is, I think a lot of ink has been spilled about the Tesla Roadster, but if we're talking about purpose-built hyper / super cars, it seems to me that the company with the 3 year headstart that already lapped the nuburgring in record time and competes in motorsports seems like the better bet to pull it off, at least from a performance perspective.

post,7hsm94,,Tesla Model Y Ideas And/Or Wishlist,"Hello! I’m a Tesla enthusiast like the rest of you and I am totally pumped for the Model 3, but 10 years of owning low profile vehicles as a tall dude (6'5) have made me think twice about reserving one. Until the Y is produced, I’m going to wait it out and see what Tesla has in store for me. That said, here’s some of the things I really want from the Y.

-	Estimated EPA range of at least 300 miles (LR model) 
-	Falcon wing doors (please…) 
-	Power operated liftgate (this just makes sense for a compact SUV crossover)
-	Towing capacity

That’s all I can think of right now. I flip flop on the falcon wing doors because I’ve heard of the absolute hell they were for a while on the early Model X’s, but I hope that by now Tesla have figured out all the issues in that regard. Not sure about the range thing either, seeing as even the MX gets lower EPA range than the MS.

Let me know what you guys think!

post,7klr43,,Tesla's Semi,"Just doing some research regarding the hype for Tesla's semi, and thought I post my... thoughts here. 

With the initiatives that the Ontario government is providing for Tesla's electric semis, the price is reasonable for companies compared to other semi's on the market. With the rising cost of fuel, the savings are very attractive and should provide a good incentive for companies to buy electric semi's. 

The limitations are two items: range, and charging times. 

With electric vehicles, charging times are relatively long, and has never been an issue with gasoline vehicles. Using a supercharger, we have a charging rate of [22 miles per hour](https://www.cars.com/articles/2013/11/how-quickly-does-the-tesla-model-s-battery-charge/). Their semi has at most a range of 500 miles. That's a charging time of 22 hours and 43 minutes. I'll let someone more qualified figure out the impact to logistics, but my impressions is that even though it might be feasible, they would need to have spare semis to compensate for this charging time. This would decrease the robustness of the system, but they might still retain their gasoline fleet as backup. 

From Detroit to Sudbury, we have a driving distance of 441 miles, which is well within the operating range of said semi's. Looking at only the GTA area where the population is concentrated, this range is further decreased, rendering electric semi's to be feasible in this region.  

Overall, realistically speaking, electric semi's aren't a universal solution to transport over highways, but rather a niche solution pertaining to local deliveries. With these two points in mind, we can narrow down the market for these vehicles to a more realistic range.",2091,True,1513609699.0,2017-12-18 16:08:19,0,12,Nullrasa,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7klr43/teslas_semi/,True,0.5,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,7ku5q6,,"Looking for some advice, considering swapping out my OEM Speed3's suspension a more comfortable setup.","So I’m thinking about doing something that seems to go against the ethos of /r/cars & MazdaSpeedForum by swapping my Speed3’s suspension bits for something more comfortable & increasing its height, and would like some advice with some questions/concerns. Post regarding this topic all seem to go in the opposite direction of what I want to achieve.


My commute is now over some of the worst maintained roads I’ve come across and include big dips, abrupt rises in pavement, raised and lowered manhole covers, crossing rail tracks multiple times a day, poorly patched potholes, etc. When I lived in Miami, I was able to deal with the stiff ride. Then I moved to Washington D.C. and the roads were bad enough that I swapped my 18-inch wheels for 16-inch wheels to give myself a little more rubber between me and the road. But now living in Baltimore, the ride quality on the OEM springs & dampers can best be described as uncouth at best. While it never crashes through to the bump stops, coming out of a steep parking lot I’ll hear the bottom of my bumper scuff against the asphalt. That being said, that’s the only complaint I have about my car. I love every other aspect of it, from the turbo, LSD, practicality, fuel economy, the feeling/feedback of the: steering, brakes, manual transmission, and yes even the clutch. So instead of selling it and buying a “more comfortable” car, I’d like to see if swapping the suspension bits will allow me to better enjoy every other aspect of my car. 

With all of those complaints in mind, I’m thinking of changing my suspension bits for something with a prioritization of comfort over sportiness. This is the setup I’m considering:

**Stock Mazda 3 springs** 

Easiest/cheapest/”most comfortable” and will give me 0.5 inches more of ground clearance.

**Koni FSD Dampers**

Decently price, and I think frequency dampening will work great to keep body roll in check while dealing well with the rail tracks & expansion joints.",2966,True,1513699405.0,2017-12-19 17:03:25,7,5,AuntieMamesTravels,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7ku5q6/looking_for_some_advice_considering_swapping_out/,True,0.82,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,7l6gil,,Putting a new drive unit in a Tesla?,"I've heard that putting a new part (like a drive unit) into a Tesla is not as easy as just swapping the part, because the car checks the serial number of the part and won't run if it detects that a part has been swapped/removed.

However, I also saw a certain Tesla enthusiast (one might call him a guru) swap parts like this, and he apparently got help from someone who was able to ""re-flash"" the linux distro running on the MCU to accept the donor parts. How hard is this? Does anyone know who did that for him, and how he did it?

Edit: on further thought, if you had a car with a smashed drive unit, and a new drive unit to replace it, would it be possible to remove the board in the smashed drive unit that contains this serial number (assuming it survived) and swap it into the donor drive unit to trick the MCU into thinking nothing has changed?",852,False,1513823626.0,2017-12-21 03:33:46,0,7,jlittle988,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7l6gil/putting_a_new_drive_unit_in_a_tesla/,True,0.31,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,7lewjk,,Got rear-ended,"https://imgur.com/gallery/tpwwc

Sad sad day friends. Is the first time that I’ve ever been involved in a car accident where I was the driver. I was stopped on the highway in heavy traffic and a lady in a Porsche Cayenne slammed into me.

I’ve linked only a single picture, I think the entire rear fender needs to be replaced. It feels like the driver seat wiggles a bit, perhaps the bolts came loose for stretched. In the trunk probably needs to be realigned.

I’m so sad. This has been my dream for 10 years. I finally get the car in March of this year and right before Christmas some lady has to racket and probably take it away from me for a while.


It did it’s job. My family is safe. That’s the most important thing and one of the many reasons why I bought this car.

Can anyone tell me what I can expect? I’ve read stories that sometimes Tesla facilities don’t have parts and it can take months to get your vehicle back. Is that what I am in for?

I have the lady’s information and of course will be filing a claim against her insurance, but roughly what kind of costs are we looking at?

In case anyone is wondering how tough these cars are, she hit me probably going between 25 and 35 mph. I was at a dead stop. The only damage is what you see in that picture, and the car drove home perfectly. They are very solid.

post,7sny1a,,"Dad is Considering selling his business, can we stay on as silent shareholders?","I apologize in advance if this is the wrong place to post this question.

Long story short - 

My dad has been running a business for most of his life. It has done pretty well for our family and helped put myself and my two siblings through school, etc. It is by no means a huge company but has a lot of potential to grow under the right hands.

Someone has made him an offer to buy it. He initially said not but the offer has gone up and he is considering it. 

He is quite tired and would like to take that money and put it into other investments and semi-retire. To be honest, I think he only continued in this business so he could support us as best he could. I think he deserves to use the money to do something he enjoys.

My brother is a little against selling. He had hoped to take over the business from my father but he is young, a little reckless (I say that with love) and still has a lot to learn before he'd be ready to do anything like that. 

Question: Myself, my sister and my brother want to know if staying in the company in some capacity is realistic, i.e. as shareholders who are paid dividends.  
I mentioned this situation as a possible alternative to my brother but I don't really know how it would work.

Employees also said that quality control workers were not experienced, and two said that some batteries are leaving the factory with a potentially serious defect, a claim that Tesla vigorously denies.""

""Many of the company's quality control workers are relatively inexperienced, make sloppy calculations and don't know when they're looking at flaws, according to several current and former employees. They said many quality inspectors were temp-to-hire workers with no automotive experience who Tesla hired via a staffing agency.

Tesla acknowledged the relative inexperience of some employees, but said new hires involved in battery production receive ""extensive training, including safety training.""

Two current engineers told CNBC that they are concerned some of the batteries being shipped do not have the minimum gap required between lithium ion cells. These engineers warned that this ""touching cells"" flaw could cause batteries to short out or, in worse cases, catch fire.

These engineers said they raised the issue internally, but their concerns were shrugged off by managers.""",1307,False,1516909723.0,2018-01-25 20:48:43,104,153,dvdmovie1,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/7syrms/tesla_employees_say_gigafactory_problems_worse/,True,0.86,2018,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,7tmirt,,An Idiot's Guide to Tesla's Lineup,"#Lineup

* **Roadster** 2-door roadster that's no longer sold. Replacement is coming in 2020
* **Model S** 5-meter long hatchback, competes with Mercedes CLS, Audi A7
* **Model X** 5-meter long SUV. It's the one with gullwing doors (Falcon Wing doors)
* **Model 3** Sometimes referred as M3 in Tesla forums, has no correlation with BMW M3. It is a 4.5-meter long sedan. Competes with Mercedes C-class, Audi A4.
* **Semi** (unreleased) I wont cover it in this guide, it's a semi truck.

#Models

* The **number** indicates the battery capacity. For example, Model S 60 means it has 60 Wh battery
* D after the number means it has **dual-motor**, which also means it is AWD. Example: Model X 75D
* P in front of the number means it is the **performance model** which has ""Insane mode"" acceleration available to choose from the center touchscreen. Example: Model S P85
* **Ludicrous mode** is an option on top of the P model. Contrary to popular belief, a stock P100D does NOT have ""Ludicrous Mode"". You can spot this model on the road by looking at an underline below the badge (e.g. underline below P85). People sometimes refer to this model by adding L to the end of the name. Example: Model S P100DL

Unlike self-driving features, none of the options listed above (dual motor, Ludicrous mode) are available as an upgrade later down the line. You are stuck with what you got from the factory.


Note: In the Model 3, Tesla has steered away from using battery capacity for describing the tiers. Instead, you get the ""Standard Range"" model with 50 kWh battery, and ""Long Range"" model with 75 kWh battery.

#Self Driving Hardware Features

* Models prior to September 2014 has zero self-driving capability in the sense that the steering wheel can't turn by itself at any given time.
* Models between September 2014 to October 2016 has **AP1** hardware, or Autopilot generation 1.

post,7vbevv,,For those wondering why people choose Model 3 over Bolt,"I'm sick of people saying the Bolt is basically the same car as the Model 3 *but available today*. No it is not, and let's not pretend it is. 

Let's start with a simple question:

# What's special about the Bolt if it had a petrol engine?

Meanwhile the Model 3, even if it was petrol, would offer:

* **Attractive, luxurious-looking design.** Design is something subjective, but we can at least agree that it looks like a Model S, a car costing twice as much, combined with a nose that looks like a Porsche Panamera, also a car double the price. The Bolt looks like a bloated version of a Chevy Spark, a 10k car, literally the cheapest GM offering today.
* **Unique interior design.** I'm not going to say it's better or worse than the competitors, because its a matter of personal preference as well, but I'm going to say its a minimalism design that we have never seen before.
* **Rear window that goes further than other cars**. Same here, you may not like it, but you can't argue that it's something new.
* **Alcantara, wood panel in the interior.** This signifies a more luxurious interior. I haven't been in either cars, but I wouldn't be surprised the plastic material is better on the 3 than the Bolt
* **Significantly smoother, larger touchscreen.** I would argue it is better than Mercedes S-class, Audi A8, even Model S and X, or actually, *literally any car*. The Bolt has something similar to other economy GM vehicles
* **Autopilot**. Hardware that is ready for full self driving
* **0-60 time in 5 seconds**
* **RWD (or AWD)**, as opposed to FWD
* **Multi-link rear suspension** (fully independent) vs. torsion beam on the Bolt (same kind of suspension as Ford Fiesta, less advanced than Ford Focus)
* And with it, comes **sporty handling characteristics**, as the reviewers mentioned.",2130,True,1517795806.0,2018-02-05 02:56:46,0,60,ptrkhh,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7vbevv/for_those_wondering_why_people_choose_model_3/,True,0.18,2018,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,7won9d,,[Discussion] I attended The Boring Company's Culver City Presentation. I'm concerned about its ability to win public trust.,"I attended the Boring Company's January 22 presentation to the City Council of the City of Culver City (this is legitimately how they refer to themselves), where they pitched their plan to burrow underneath the town as part of their “Phase 1” 6.5 mile tunnel. I went with the intention to simply gather information for my podcast, and left with the sinking feeling that the company is biting off more than it can chew.

The Boring Company presenters themselves were competent, capable, and as well-prepared as I imagine they could have been, considering the circumstances. (I'll get to that in a bit.) My two main takeaways from that City Council meeting were:

**1.)** There's a vast difference between selling private goods and winning public trust

**2.)** Any company will struggle to succeed when their CEO (by his own admission) dedicates ""2 or 3 percent"" of his time to it.

Let's backup, and discuss how the Council meeting went before The Boring Company gave their presentation and fielded questions. It shines a light on how much of public work is a slow grind of competing interests, and a stark contrast to the ""move fast and break things"" mentality of many technology companies.

A Boy Scout was invited to the front of the room to lead all of us in the Pledge of Allegiance. And after Vice Mayor Thomas Small discussed the upcoming ""Kindness Week"" at Culver City Middle School, eight residents were each given two minutes to speak on their chosen topic. (I'm not sure how these eight were chosen specifically.) A selection:

One man complained about Film LA’s (the organization that oversees film permits in the Los Angeles area) abuse of Culver City parking. He was quite emotional and infuriated.

Another speaker - a poet - read a couple poems she had written, one comparing Congresspeople to Baboons.

Yet another discussed permitting requests for proposed cannabis retail stores.

post,80d897,,UPS Dip,"I'm considering buying the dip, do your DD and tell me what you think. Here are my thoughts:

A correction was definitely expected after amazon announced their plans for last-mile delivery. But, from what I found, Amazon deliveries make up between 5-10 percent of UPS revenues. Therefore, the 25 percent drop in UPS since mid January seems a bit harsh.

With e-commerce on the rise, there will continue be a growing demand for logistic companies. 

Also, UPS has been making great strides towards electrifying their fleet. They just announced they will be partnering with Workhorse Group, and sampling 50 electric vans. Tesla has also announced that they will be partnering with UPS to provide them with electric semi trucks. With electric vehicles becoming the cheaper alternative to gas and diesel, these  partnerships could be the beginning of something great, and really improve UPS's bottom line. 

I'm curious to see how Amazon goes about obtaining an electric fleet. Workhorse is a small company, and will have their hands full with the UPS partnership. I cannot imagine Elon partnering with Bezos, but that's just a gut feeling, and would love to hear everyone's thoughts on that. 

Will UPS continue to dip? Or is it ready to pop? Let me know what you guys think. 

Edit: I have positions in workhorse group and Tesla. I also decided to buy UPS earlier today.

post,80tyfa,,How can I make at least 50 dollars daily consistently?,"Okay before I get the angry, hateful comments let me tell you guys a quick story of where I am at in my life.

I am 24 years old, I have an electrical engineering degree, and my biggest passion in the world is playing soccer/futbol. My biggest dream is to play at least at the semi pro level. I won't get into it too much but I have struggled with injuries most of my life and due to those injuries, I decided to focus on my engineering career rather than on my futbol career. But recently I came to realize that we are all going to die one day... and I don't want to die with a lot of ""what ifs"" on my mind. So I found a great personal trainer that is helping me reach my athletic goals. I train with him twice a day for about 6 hours in total.

Anyways, I can go on and on about my athletic goals but I'm here to seek financial advice. I was working around 60 hours a week at my old job(Controls Engineering). I was able to save up a bit but I'll eventually run out if I don't start getting some income soon lol.

What do you guys suggest I should focus on? What has worked for you guys? I've been doing some research on dropshipping items from amazon and walmart on ebay but I'm open to suggestions before I pull any trigger.

I just want to make enough money to survive right now. I pay 500 a month for rent, 100 for my training sessions and about 300 on other bills(phone, gas , groceries). 50 dollars daily should be sufficient to survive.

What I've tried so far: -Dropshipping items from aliexpress through shopify and facebook ads -- Results: Sold one 9.99 item after spending 3 weeks and 40 dollars of facebook ads. Also, didn't like the fact that my customer had to wait 2-4 weeks to get their item.

""People who have worked at Tesla say Mr. Musk’s ambition and vision are inspiring. But the hard-charging culture can be exhausting, they say.

Brett Foster, a former Tesla engineer who redesigned faulty retractable door handles on the Model S, recalls a profanity-laced email in mid-2013 in which Mr. Musk prodded managers to soften their communications with lower-level employees. “ ‘Don’t be an a—’ was the gist of it,” Mr. Foster says. “I actually kind of liked that he did it.”

Some managers tried to emulate Mr. Musk’s never-say-no style, but “without being as smart as Elon,” says Mr. Foster, who didn’t interact with the CEO regularly. “I struggled with the culture and am extremely happy I am no longer there.” He now works at Samsung Electronics Co.""

**SWCH is a data center, colocation business that has more growth potential than its peers. This is because it is a data center company which is not structured as a REIT. REITS have to pay 90% of their earnings as dividends to remain classified as a REIT and reap those tax benefits. The large data center companies like EQIX and DLR are REITS because of the large amounts of properties they own. SWCH chose to be structured a different way, as a UPC, so they can reinvest their earnings back into their company.**


Switch has their main data center facility in Las Vegas, Nevada, and this facility has an interesting story. In 2002, the CEO Rob Roy attended an Enron auction for this facility. The facility was built with millions of dollars, and Roy bought it for $930K. This was a clear and very strategic move by Roy, and these strategic moves have continued through the life of his company. I like this because it shows the CEO is very strategic, and his decisions have been smart and executed so far.


Comparison's of their locations to two large other colocations businesses, Equinix (EQIX) and Digital Trust Realty (DLR):


* SWCH has a fully operational campus called Core in Las Vegas. This is their primary revenue campus with a utilization rate of 94%, gross square footage of 2M, and power capacity at 275MW with construction of another facility bringing it up to 315MW. Their other campuses are a bit unnerving. They have a campus in Tahoe Reno with one operational building with a total of eight buildings planned.

>RATINGS RATIONALE

>Tesla's ratings reflect the significant shortfall in the production rate of the company's Model 3 electric vehicle. The company also faces liquidity pressures due to its large negative free cash flow and the pending maturities of convertible bonds ($230 million in November 2018 and $920 million in March 2019). Tesla produced only 2,425 Model 3s during the fourth quarter of 2017; it is currently targeting a weekly production rate of 2,500 by the end of March, and 5,000 per week by the end of June. This compares with the company's year-earlier production expectations of 5,000 per week by the end of 2017 and 10,000 by the end of 2018.

post,8a8ts4,,More specific valuation question,"In a previous post I confessed I struggled with the idea of valuation. Particularly, I struggle with understanding how the price of a stock is tied to the value of the company. I got some great feedback. 

I've been told that when I buy a stock, I buy a percentage of the company, including its debts and revenues. But more than that, I buy a share of its expected earnings. Moreover, I was reminded that Graham famously wrote that in the short term the market acts like a voting machine, while in the long term it acts like a weight machine. Basically, that while a stock like Tesla may be overpriced in the short term, the stock price will eventually meet with the company's true valuation in the long term. So I set out to test that theory. 

I backtested the stock for Ford Motor Company. Using this site: https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio . If I invested $10,000 in Ford Motor Company in January of 1986, I would have $99,137 by March 31, 2018. Adjusted for inflation, it'd be more like $43,518. 

This suggests that Ford Motor Company is worth over 4X what it was worth back in 1986. However, as I understand it, the American auto industry has been in decline and is a shell of the monolith it used to be. I can't understand how a company that is weaker today than in 1986 is valued at 4X what it was back in its hey day. Hey day might be a bit of a stretch, but I think it's safe to say that the American Auto industry was doing much better in the 80s than today.

post,8as5ek,,Tesla and Apple,"Hi all,

I know, I know, one more post about Tesla, but I'm currently trying to build a model to see at what valuation it would be interesting to buy, but I'm starting to think I'm wasting my time. Tesla is almost tripling their net losses yoy while not even doubling their revenue. Even with the recent drop, Enterprise Value is 60 billion.
Then I'm thinking WTF? OK, they may be the next Apple, but even then, that's hell of a lot of risk for the possible reward. They are crippled with debt.

Now I remembered, at some point Apple almost went bankrupt. And we can draw many similarities between Apple and Tesla. Are there any similarities regarding the financials? Was Apple that bad financially back in the day? I'm thinking I'd be willing to take a risk on tesla if the EV was around 20 billion, but that would imply a stock price of ... less than $70 with current debt levels.

Seriously, even with amazing futuristic prospects, solar roofs, vertical integration, etc. and I'm personally super hyped about the company and their products, I just don't see how this makes sense?

post,8en3im,,"The BFR: too big, too soon?","Or not?

The most important and most remarkable development in the human breakout into Space is SpaceX. What SpaceX and Musk are doing is what the general space community had been longing for, and tried to develop in fits and starts for many years. But I have to observe the whole BFR issue from the standpoint of having worked in and watched the unfolding history of space transportation development. BFR looks like a “bridge too far” after the very savvy and practical approaches of the Falcon series to date.

BFR is “too big,” and “too soon,” because there’s no market emerging in the near future for it. Also, the underlying premise behind BFR is to accelerate Musk’s dream of colonizing Mars. This is a mistake. Evidence and documentation is emerging that implies humans, in their present evolution, are not likely to thrive as permanent residents off of Earth. Long-term visitors, yes, but a lifetime, or even being born “out there?” Not likely. I can elaborate on that at another time, but suffice it to say that Mars is not a sober goal for having 1 million humans by 2100. And building a civilization on Mars with chemical rocket transportation, even if that is just meant for a first phase, is highly questionable. But that is what drives Musk, and why he, ultimately founded SpaceX.

Meanwhile though, he’s developing what’s turning into the most successful space transportation system ever. That comes first. And Musk knows that if BFR is to succeed, it must first fulfill actual needs much closer to home. Hence such schemes as the “point-to-point” ballistic transportation idea. That was something first advanced by Robert Heinlein. But generally, one starts “small” with such ideas. BFR is not small.

post,8g8uk6,,"Elon, The third Industrial revolution, and cryptocurrency","For each industrial revolution, there were advancements in communication, energy, and transportation 

1st=Print, coal, steam engine

2nd=Telephone, fossil fuels, cars

Future revolution=Internet, cheap renewables, and self-driving vehicles

The future supply chain will be powered cheaply by advanced solar and wind energy, run by AI machines all connected and controlled through the internet. This will make almost all business more efficient thus allowing an economic boom.

Elon will be involved in all these areas with Starlink, solar city, Tesla, and SpaceX.

In addition to supply chain improvement there will also be big improvements for consumers:

Housing bills- (Solar City) install a solar roof to supply your energy or buy energy from your neighbor with excess energy from his solar roof. Blockchain technology (power ledger) allows the peer to peer sale of solar energy thus eliminating the middleman, saving the consumer money and reducing effects on the environment. All house appliances and heating could be run on this energy. In addition to power and heat, your internet/phone/TV may also be supplied by Starlink depending on its success/cost. (optimistic)

Transportation- (Tesla)You could either own an electric car and charge it via the energy mentioned above or use driverless taxi service. For long distance use BFR earth to earth to fly across the globe in less than an hour. Or to Mars!!

All of these systems can be implemented anywhere in the world. In this future, a portion of the global spending on bills and travel could be paid indirectly to one company/ companies owned by Elon. Why not make your own global currency to allow ease of entry to all citizens of the world and reduce fees? Enter cryptocurrency.

post,8j63s5,,"When people Who have No actual Experience Write Crazy: ""Apple Buys Tesla? Amazon Buys Sears? 3 Dream Mergers That Just Make Sense""","https://www.thestreet.com/opinion/apple-should-buy-tesla-and-amazon-should-buy-sears-dream-deals-14586350

Even a cursory examination of these ideas show no business or tech common sense at all!  I guess given the author doesn't have an MBA or any actual business experience, I should cut her some slack but she's built up as supposedly knowing something.  Honestly not so much.

Apple Buys Tesla:

The first problem is core competency and how Apple has historically been loath to enter areas where it well knows it has none.  

First there was the iPhone and staying at arm's length with all carriers either in terms of investment or buy-out - Apple knows the telecom business model is something it knows **nothing** about and would never be good at.  

Second is Business computing - why doesn't Apple continually avoid that market?  Because their business model involves selling and support direct to end users but in business IT is the buyer and the end-user gets no say is what computer is put in front of them; this break Apple's business model and company strengths so they beg off.  

Third is televisions and Apple TV - why did Steve Jobs say he'd ""figured it out but couldn't actually crack the nut of TV?"" - because TV HW is low margin which doesn't fit the Apple business model and cable companies present the same problem as telecom carriers - low margin, diffuse markets, race-to-the-bottom with the wrong business model.  So why not Tesla?  

These are the same problems as a Tesla acquisition would entail - the business model of mass production of cars has neither the margins nor the business model fit to what Apple does well.

Amazon Buys Sears:

Ah no.  A cursory investigation of the recent history of Sears shows it has become a poison apple - the guy who owns Sears has sold of its most valuable assets, the real estate and key brands out, and merely leases the same back to Sears.  That includes all stores and  key brands like Die Hard and Craftsman Tools.",6356,True,1526238378.0,2018-05-13 21:06:18,0,0,mantrap2,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/8j63s5/when_people_who_have_no_actual_experience_write/,True,0.5,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

post,8srw0z,,Questions about the Chevy Volt history,"I have a father-in-law that is an EV-skeptic (or at least is someone who prefers the status quo). Whenever he wants to talk about EVs he only brings up the negative headlines like Tesla AP crashes and single-day TSLA stock price drops.

But most of all he likes to harp on the Chevy Volt. He enjoys touting a claim that the government bought 10,000 Volts to boost sales numbers. He also said that a lot of the Volt batteries caught fire. Is there any truth to these claims?

A quick Google search shows there was a lot of controversy surrouding the Volt when it arrived in 2011. A lot of talk about government subsidies, etc. But my question is, is the Volt really deserving of all this controversy? Or is all that old news and is the Volt now able to stand on its own two feet, so to speak? Is my FIL just using old headlines about the Volt to convince himself EVs are bad?

\*\*EDIT\*\*

Thank you everyone for all the information! I'm glad to know that the voice of reason at the back of my head telling me that the ""government buying 10,000 Volts"" doesn't sound accurate, was correct.

Unfortunately, I don't own an electric vehicle and none my close family or friends have one either, so I don't have one in the driveway for him to try out. I like the idea of taking him to the dealer for a test drive, but the trick will be getting him to believe it is worth his time. I'm hoping to get an EV soon.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk elicited quite a bit of [skepticism](https://bgr.com/2018/06/25/lamborghini-vs-tesla-roadster-battery-speed-terzo-millennio/) when he [boasted](https://electrek.co/2017/06/13/tesla-roadster-next-gen-elon-musk-maximum-plaid/)  in June 2017 that the electric automaker’s next-generation Roadster  would be able to accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in under two  seconds — a feat that [Musk said](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/11/17/tesla-unveils-electric-big-rig-truck-amid-manufacturing/) would make the vehicle the “fastest production car ever.”

Now, a Tesla test driver is saying Musk’s boast might have even been “conservative.”

“I think I can say  without getting in trouble that those are actual figures,” says Emile  Bouret, who says he's test-driven the new Roadster. 

""Those aren’t theoretical. Those aren’t calculations. We’ve done those numbers,"" Bouret says in a [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=242&v=UcI-5AzPlr8)  posted to the VINwiki YouTube page on Tuesday. ""And I probably  shouldn’t say that those numbers are even conservative, but they are.

 “That thing is going to be a proper weapon.""

It’s been another rough quarter for the rollout of [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US)’s Model 3. The factory was shut down at least twice for [extensive upgrades](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-06-08/tesla-model-3-photos-of-elon-musk-s-factory-in-fremont), a new production line was hastily erected in a [tent in the parking lot](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-25/the-future-of-tesla-hinges-on-this-gigantic-tent), and Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk moved from sleeping on the couch to [sleeping under the desk](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-races-to-exit-teslas-production-hell-1530149814). He was [even seen personally torquing bolts](https://twitter.com/S_Padival/status/1009956753272782848) on an assembly line, alongside a summer intern. 

Now the mad scramble to meet a self-imposed production deadline—a rate of 5,000 cars per week by the end of June—is coming to an end. The quarter concludes Saturday, and Tesla is expected to report its production figures for the last three months before the July 4 holiday. Tesla has repeatedly fallen short of its own manufacturing targets. Now investors will find out exactly how many cars Tesla made, sold, and stockpiled and what sort of weekly rate they were finally able to achieve.

Here’s our rundown of what to expect. 

## Seeing a Shortfall: Bloomberg’s Model 3 Tracker

post,8vu4mx,,Historical context on the tax credit phase out - Toyota Prius,"Most folks waiting for their Model 3s believe (or at least hope) Tesla delayed selling the 200,000th car to July to extend the full $7,500 tax credit to December 31, 2018.  I feel that's likely, though others disagree.  There's some confusion (a least to me) when and how we'll find out what the deal is.  

I've read nothing is official until we see the *official* IRS form, which should be something like [form 30D.  New Qualified Plug-in Electric Drive Motor Vehicles - Tesla, Inc.] (https://www.irs.gov/businesses/30d-new-qualified-plug-in-electric-drive-motor-vehicles-tesla-inc), whcih I don't believe will be updated until 2019.  Hopefully, we'll get word from Tesla or even the IRS sooner than that.  


I thought a good guide might be to look at what happened with Toyota in 2006 when they each hit the hybrid limit and began the similar tax credit phase out.


According to this [Sept 29, 2006 IRS Press Release](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/additional-toyota-and-lexus-vehicles-certified-for-the-energy-tax-credit), Toyota reported hitting it in 2006 Q2.  So this release came out about 3 months later.  It appears word got out before then, as evidenced by this [August 12, 2006 Tax Blog](http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2006/08/toyota_prius_is.html), but I haven't found an earlier source.  So that's 1.5 months after the quarter ended.  I didn't have any luck finding references from earlier.

Incidentally, I found an [Inside EV article discussing the Prius History in relation to Tesla](https://insideevs.com/toyota-prius-history-paints-picture-tesla-future/), but not tax credit specific.

Any thoughts?  Should we just Tweet at Elon Musk to ask when they hit 200k?",1689,False,1530639227.0,2018-07-03 19:33:47,19,12,SodaPopin5ki,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/8vu4mx/historical_context_on_the_tax_credit_phase_out/,True,0.91,2018,both,search,False,False,0,
post,8vxnz0,,PSA for US buyers: arbitration clause,"I just bought the model 3 (I get it this week!) and saw there's a binding arbitration agreement in the ""Motor Vehicle Purchase Agreement."" I just wanted to make sure everyone was aware of this and that you can opt out. You must opt out within 30 days of ""signing"" the Purchase Agreement.

First, to opt out, write a letter to:

    Tesla, Inc.  
    PO Box 15430  
    Fremont, CA 94539-7970

Your letter needs to include:

* Your name
* Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
* Intent to opt out of the arbitration provision

If you paid your $2500 deposit on 6/27 when the remaining reservations opened, you should notify Tesla by 7/27 to be safe, so mail your letter by 7/23.

## What's this about?

Normally if a company harms you, you have several avenues to resolve the issue: negotiation, non-binding arbitration, individual law suits, class-action (group) law suits, and more. You can also appeal the courts decision if necessary. However, mandatory binding arbitration limits your options to just individual arbitration, so it's much more difficult to get resolution and much more likely that they would win. You can't appeal a binding arbitration decision.

This agreement forces arbitration for any issue with Tesla, including privacy, safety, warranty, and lease problems.

Binding arbitration is not consumer friendly. Here are a few articles about it.

Not all EV's coming out before 2020 are on the list. I've mostly focused on long range \~250mi or greater, North American availability (and a bit of Europe), and large production volumes. I've also ignored start ups as they have a short history filled with missed deadlines and retooled schedules.

post,8xlozj,,How Silicon Valley stops Innovation,"Silicon Valley promotes their amazing ability to build innovative products and services that change the world. The reality is that this is for the most part a lie.

The most “innovative” companies have actually done very simple things that for the most part aren’t very special. This isn’t usually fault of the founders, rather, the ignorant “investment” community whose real purpose is to hold back amazing people.

Uber should’ve released self-driving cars in 2012. Google Fiber should’ve been in the USA everywhere by 2010 and global by 2011. Apple’s products are absolutely trash considering the amount of bugs they have, yet they have “all the money in the world” for development. This isn’t the fault of Travis Kalanick (he’s a fucking smart person, and people that call him arrogant are jealous) or every team member at Fiber. It’s more the lack of imagination and creativity (along with jealousy) that many “wealthy” individuals have regarding the future.

I’ve found that in Silicon Valley, you will develop an up and coming world-changing technology (or have a full idea and plan for it), and jealous investors will take control of the company and screw it over (this is just one example). There is so much fraud with products (MagicQueef being one of them) and the announcements made in general. Snapchat is a joke that I will not even bother discussing.

God forbid an actual self-made teen (as I was) comes along and tries to make a name for himself. Almost INSTANTLY I was ousted by frauds such as Vinod Khosla (who is an ignorant, broke, and sad person) whose life depends on his false billionaire title.

Tesla cars are made in China, their mileage is about 1/3 of what is advertised (sorry unless you drive like an ignorant Tesla driver), and you’re not saving the world by driving the car. I’ve lived in China and there’s nothing wrong with having cars made in China, but you can’t make it such a selling point (I know that “made in USA” is not the main reason people buy Teslas).",2718,True,1531198469.0,2018-07-10 06:54:29,1,2,advncdfinesse,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/8xlozj/how_silicon_valley_stops_innovation/,True,0.54,2018,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,8xqgcg,,Cars We Might See On US Roads 2019-2021,"**This post was one of my posts from** r/Future_Cars**.**

We know what's coming for 2018, but we don't know what is coming later, yet. But I have searched far and wide on the web to figure out which cars may be coming to the US in the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.

* **Alfa Romeo Alfetta**

The Alfa Romeo Alfetta was a fastback coupe and sedan sold 1972 to 1987 but was sold as the Sports Sedan in the US. AR wants to bring it back as a mid-size or full-size luxury sedan that would fight MB, Lincoln, Audi, BMW, Cadillac, and Jaguar sedans. If it does come out it will revive the Alfetta nameplate, but won't be as similar to the model.

* **BMW i4**

Nobody knows what the upcoming BMW i4 EV could be. Some say hatchback, some say sedan, and some say wagon. I am pretty sure it would be 4-Series-based sedan that would have a wagon variant. I can be wrong, but, you know. It isn't coming until somewhere in between '19 and '21.

* **Chrysler Atlantica/Aspen**

The Chrysler Aspen was the slow-selling version of the Dodge Durango. I don't know why, but it was. Just like the Pacifica crossover. It is rumored that there will be a new Aspen, possibly called Atlantica, that would go up against the Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia, Buick Enclave, Mazda CX-9, and the upcoming Hyundai Palisade. Just imagine a Chrysler SUV with pieces of those others mixed in.

* **Honda Passport:**

The Honda Passport wasn't much other than just a rebadged Isuzu Rodeo sold from year 1993 to 2002. It didn't sell that well. But Honda is cooking up a new Passport that might sell better. It is rumored to be a coupe-like crossover based on the Honda Avancier/UR-V sold in China.

* **Jeep Wagoneer/Grand Wagoneer**

The Jeep Wagoneer was such a great seller at the time that it lasted in the same looks for a few decades, but it just got old and sales started to slow down. So, Jeep wants to make a new one (possibly succeeding the ageing Grand Cherokee) which might be based on the China-only Grand Commander.",3946,True,1531237998.0,2018-07-10 17:53:18,0,13,WaddlesJP13,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8xqgcg/cars_we_might_see_on_us_roads_20192021/,True,0.49,2018,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,8zef4k,,Longtime muscle car guy and r/cars reader's thoughts on a weekend with a Tesla Model 3,"As a lifelong car guy, one of my foundational rules is that if someone offers me time behind the wheel of something I've never driven before, be it an econobox or an exotic, I take it. I may lend up liking it, I may not, but at least I can say I've driven it. It was with this mindset that I said ""yes"" when a friend offered to let me babysit his Tesla Model 3 while he was away for a weekend.  As I find many of the critics on here seem to have never actually driven a Model 3 for an extended period, I thought I'd offer my longtime car guy thoughts.  I'm also not looking to debate aspects of Tesla's cult, or Elon Musk as a person; this is about a car.

The car in question was a Rear Wheel Drive Model 3, with the (currently mandatory) premium upgrade package, upgraded battery, and Autopilot.  First thing I noticed is that the Model 3, while not as pretty as the Model S, does look better in person than in photos, although that's not saying much.  I poked the awkward fulcrum-based, different-for-the-sake-of-being-different door handle and got in.  Seats were comfy, although the floor seemed higher than a normal car due to the batteries underneath, which made it tough to find a comfortable seating position.

I'll save the missives about no-dashboard-screen-only argument and just say that during the day, I got used to having to look over to get my speed without much issue.  Climate controls were anchored to the bottom of the main screen such that I could safely adjust the temperature while driving, while other simple things were reserved for redlights.  And while the blank slat in front of me was less offensive than expected during the day, the one thing I didn't get used to, at all, was having just a void of darkness in front of me during nighttime driving.  Ironically, in a car that requires you to go into a touchscreen menu to open the glove box, that void in front of my eyes at night ended up being the one thing I couldn't get over.",4692,True,1531772308.0,2018-07-16 22:18:28,729,437,ViperRT10Matt,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8zef4k/longtime_muscle_car_guy_and_rcars_readers/,True,0.91,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

>Remember that Tesla was sitting on upwards of [35,000](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/26/tesla-motors-incs-meet-model-x-tour-begins.aspx) Model X reservations. So Tesla has probably already worked through over 10% of its order backlog. But if a greater portion of the remaining backlog had already confirmed their orders and entered the production queue, the quoted delivery timeline for new orders should seemingly be farther out.

>For instance, even if Tesla has prematurely hit its peak expected production rate of 1,000 X units per week *and* all of those production slots were taken, that would theoretically represent about 7,000 additional confirmed orders through the beginning of June.

As usual, Tesla’s vehicle deliveries drive most of its earning results since vehicle sales represent the automaker’s main revenue stream at the moment.

[Tesla already confirmed its second quarter 2018 deliveries: 40,740 vehicles](https://electrek.co/2018/07/02/tesla-official-model-3-production-numbers-q2/) – a new record for the company thanks to the Model 3 production ramp starting to produce decent numbers.

The delivery breakdown for the quarter was:

* 18,440 Model 3’s
* 10,930 Model S vehicles
* 11,370 Model X SUVs.

Those numbers are adjusted slightly during the release of the earnings.

Additionally, Tesla has a high number of vehicles currently in transit: 11,166 Model 3 vehicles and 3,892 Model S and X vehicles were heading to customers at the end of Q2.

Here are Tesla quarterly global deliveries of all current vehicles in production since their launches:

post,93rji3,,Clarification on business vs entrepreneur,"This seems obvious. It also seems arrogant to some. But it is just a genuine (possibly rhetorical) question, to make a point on a view I have and hopefully debate and learn.

TLDR; Q: What is the difference between r/Entrepreneur and r/business? Or, what is the difference between entrepreneurism (besides that its not a real word) and business?

Long (boring) version

My opinion, well, first, my brief background:

I am a Mechanical Engineer with masters degree who worked as a professional in the power generation industry for 10 years and then emigrated to the US recently, half (unsuccessfully) looking for a job and half (looking at starting a company). I have too many eggs in too many baskets. I have done Udacity's Self Driving Car and FullStack Developer Nanodegrees, and learned with pramp and 'cracking the coding interview' to appreciate data structures and algorithms and the kinds of problems developers must solve. So I can code and build stuff. I like data (eveyone does) and have spent a lot of time building stuff with tableau public. My money I have saved (not a lot, when converted to USD from my '3rd world' upbringing) is all in Tesla, as it is the most logical place to put it (please don't debate me on that in this forum - just sharing my background).

I want to build a company and understand the obvious leveraging that software allows one. But no matter where I go, from indiehackers, to reddit, everything about entrepreneurism is either: start with basics mow lawns, and then buy the mowers and have a yard service to........... make billions!

The the only thing in between are not tangible - seo, marketing, saas, following leads, productivity apps, selling courses on online marketing and branding, selling courses on coding interviews, selling courses on self improvement, etc. Anyway, I am not selling anything and have nothing to get you onto (I do have a tangible business which I hope will work, but who knows).",4056,True,1533147724.0,2018-08-01 20:22:04,1,0,supalist,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/93rji3/clarification_on_business_vs_entrepreneur/,True,1.0,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

""Goldman Sachs Group Inc. hadn’t been formally tapped as a financial adviser by Tesla Inc.’s chief executive officer when Musk revealed plans last week to take the automaker private and said he’d secured the funding for the transaction, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Musk said on Twitter late Monday that he’s working with Goldman Sachs and private-equity firm Silver Lake as financial advisers to take Tesla private. Such a statement from a public company CEO typically signals a formal agreement. And in a normal go-private process, a senior executive like Musk would have detailed plans from those advisers on funding sources before disclosing the take-private effort. ""

""Silver Lake appears to be in a similar situation. Reuters reported Monday that the firm hasn’t been hired as an adviser in an official capacity, and the Financial Times reported that Silver Lake was unaware of Musk’s plan when it was announced last week.""

post,99fjgi,,Tesla. Bought 100 shares at $305. Why so much hate.,"30 years old. 60% of net worth in Wealthfront/Betterment/Vanguard indexes, 15% cash, 15% stocks, 10% gold and other assets.

I own 3 stocks now (up from 2). I buy stocks to sell in my retirement (obviously if they are big short term gains I can swap out at LT gains). JNJ, Alphabet, and now Tesla.

&#x200B;

So I just bought Tesla shares against the advice of what seems like everyone here.

Here are my reasons for buying:

1. Everyone I know with a Tesla says it is the best car they have ever driven in and will likely get another Tesla as their next car.
2. I would say the vast majority of people I speak to about their next car all say the same thing 'if I had the money my next car will be a Tesla'. 
3. Battery technology/production capability. I would say the odds are high that Tesla has a breakthrough innovation in the space of energy storage.
4. Home battery + solar systems is the future of the energy grid. 
5. Has anyone driven in a Ford/GM lately. They are literally JUNK on wheels. Plus the debt, legacy costs these companies carry. German/Japanese/Korean auto manufactures are good quality, but they lack either the technology innovation (electric/self-driving), or are anchored down by legacy. They can't compete with Tesla on the dealership model.
6. Smart people work at Tesla. I can't tell you how many times I meet someone who would have trouble putting a square peg through a square hole, then find out they work at a Fortune 500 (in a senior position). I've met two Tesla employees and they were very impressive. Same experience with Google.
7. Oil, environmental regulation (maybe no batteries) resistant.

post,99sweh,,Investing in Green/Alternate energy!,"I am finding it really difficult to invest in this area. Investing in solar specifically has so many moving parts. You have installers like Sun Run backed by Comcast,Costco, and even MLB i believe. Sounds good but the contracts they bind you to for leasing extends 20 years. Say your panels arent fitted right (Dont put out enough power) for your place you could end up paying more for electric/solar combined. 

In regard to the tariffs. They seem to have been implemented to help companies such as First Solar, yet First Solar had a recent drop of 25%, along with Canadian Solar (these are manufacturers) . I THINK this is because even though they are American, or Canadian based, their panel manufacturing is overseas (Canadian solar is anyway but they trade similarly so im thinking its the case for both). The tariff in theory was only supposed to affect the competitors of First Solar. First Solar uses a different material that is not included in the Tariff. Maybe the uncertainty of this whole thing is what drove the market down, and Tariffs just accelerated the process. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnOdSmNQJfc - about tariffs. 

Another moving part is the price keeps dropping and the panels are getting more efficient. This seems great, but it cuts into profitability. Not only that, it also incentivizes people to wait and eventually own their solar panels. Which brings up a battery/storage issue. Tsla was supposed to be going after that with the powerwall. 
I will say in my findings, Owning a Solar panel seemed like the best way to go. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cS8d1jc3Lvs - Same guy. Talks about how he recouped his investment in 6 years? but now you can start making money back in 3. But its a big down payment.

post,9alhxg,,"WSJ: Funding Was Secured, but Elon Walked Away","[https://t.co/5tINyqqTRb](https://t.co/5tINyqqTRb)

&#x200B;

The Tesla Inc. board convened Thursday at the company's factory in Fremont, Calif., in a conference room where Elon Musk often spent the night. His sleeping bag was still on the floor. 

The agenda was Mr. Musk's audacious plan to take Tesla private, which he had sprung on the investment world 16 days earlier via tweets. He was joined in the room by board members, lawyers, bankers and advisers, members of a Wall Street transaction machine put into motion by the entrepreneur's idea. 

Mr. Musk's plan turned out more shaky than his tweets suggested. He had told the world he had funding ""secured,"" and one tweet elaborated that the deal was so certain it needed only a shareholder vote. 

As the team hustled to put form to his idea, lining up investors willing to put up the tens of billions of dollars required for the deal, Mr. Musk was having doubts, according to people familiar with this thinking. 

A buyout, even if accomplished, would force some of the technology mutual funds that had been ardent supporters to trim their stakes. It might mean allowing competitors inside his tent -- one of the investors his bankers had lined up was Volkswagen AG, people familiar with the matter said. 

Taking Tesla private also would displace legions of small-fry stockholders -- a merry band of electric-car fanatics willing to look past Tesla's rickety finances and its struggle to master the skill of mass-producing automobiles. Taking their place would be more sophisticated investors tugging on a tighter leash. 

Then there was the photo emailed to him last week from an elderly couple, dressed in Tesla Inc. T-shirts and baseball caps. The couple held up a handwritten sign congratulating Mr. Musk for producing 7,000 electric cars in seven days. Their message: ""Thanks, Elon! Two happy stockholders!"" 

Mr. Musk forwarded the email to a friend. ""Made my day,"" he wrote. It also nagged at him.",10132,True,1535339064.0,2018-08-27 05:04:24,482,188,mayurthaker,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9alhxg/wsj_funding_was_secured_but_elon_walked_away/,True,0.94,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

post,9dw4fr,,Why Tesla Energy should and will make an Air-Conditioner,"Elon on JRE last night suggested he has definitely thought of developing a new air-conditioning system. See below for the link to the video @ 2:04:20 and a quick transcription:

https://youtu.be/ycPr5-27vSI?t=2h3m4s

JR: ""Have you thought about creating an air-conditioning system?""

Elon pauses and makes a funny face as to suggest that's he definitely has...

JR: ""I think you have... trick question...""

EM: ""I cannot answer questions about future potential products.""

Perhaps this was just a whiskey-infused Elon doing what he does best, creating speculation about nothing. But, lets assume this will happen within next 5 years. Here's why this would be a smart move for Tesla Energy:

Heating and air conditioning accounts for ~50% of the average U.S. household’s energy bill each year.

$52 Bn = North American air-conditioner market estimate for 2020 by Radiant Insights, Inc

Even small advancements in tech, resulting in minor efficiency improvements would significantly decrease the size and capacity (and thus cost and materials supply/demand) of residential solar and storage products.

Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. Besides transportation, residential and commercial building energy usage is the #1 source of emissions (at least in the U.S).

The # of AC's is expected to triple from 1.6 bn units to 5.6 bn units globally by 2050 due to a warming climate and development in the Global South. Source: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/climate/air-conditioning.html

Analyst Ryan Brinkman reiterated the underweight rating he’s had on the stock for at least three years, and his price target of $195, which is 37% below Thursday’s closing price.

The SEC’s suit could “hasten the inevitable transition of Tesla shares toward being valued based upon fundamentals alone (fundamentals which we have long held do not support a value close to the current trading price),” Brinkman wrote in a note to clients.

[Elon Musk](https://youtu.be/uslpOMGdyhU) 

I have been an avid supporter of Tesla since placing an order for my Signature Model S.  I can not, in good conscience, stand by and watch Elon succumb to the unjust strong arming by the questionably motivated SEC.

I plan to form a [petition](https://www.change.org/p/sec-exonerate-elon-musk?recruiter=902740854&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=share_petition&utm_term=Search%3ESAP%3EUS%3ENonBrand-Tier%201%3EDiscovery%3EBMM); and would like to know what else I can do to support Elon... this is absolutely insane.  

In the recent fan made video, a clip highlighted Elon saying that he would never give up!  I realize the weight of the world has been put on his shoulders, but kowtowing to the SEC in this matter is 100% wrong; it also signals a victory for the cancerous oil lobbyists that have been gunning for Elon since they realized they are 5-10 years behind the curve.

I am absolutely devistated, as an owner and a shareholder, that Elon would agree to admit he was wrong when he has already emphatically stated that he rejects the SEC’s claims of acting unethically.

The intent must be examined; and there was never an intent for his tweet to manipulate the market.  The only manipulation has, for YEARS, been the greedy short position holder that constantly spew negative stories, unsubstantiated claims, and target attack without merit.

I stand by Elon, Tesla, and the world view being held by so many of your supporters.

Please! Do not let Elon lose this battle... he deserves better!

post,9k9167,,Elon Musk's Volunteer Army Out in Force at Buzzing Tesla Outlets,"
Elon Musk got sued and quickly settled with the SEC? Whatever. The big news for Janet Beach was finally getting her hands on the wheel of the Tesla Model 3 she ordered 18 months ago.

“I bought it without driving it, that’s how much confidence I have,” said Beach, who picked up her sedan in Bellevue, Washington. She hasn’t lost faith in the company that made it, or in its chief executive officer. Controversy is to be expected. “There’s to be a little bit of negative commentary as he pursues his dream of changing the world.”

There was a lot of that kind of talk over the weekend, as Tesla Inc. counted down to the final hours of the quarter ending at midnight Sunday and tallied the numbers of how many electric cars it could churn out and deliver to customers. Will Tesla show there’s enough demand for electric cars for them to enter the mainstream -- and as money-makers?

Musk has given assurances that the company is on the verge of being out of the red after reporting its largest-ever loss in the last quarter, and that production of the Model 3 is finally humming. He told employees in an email obtained by Bloomberg News that profitability was in sight. If the last push to boost deliveries beats the clock with big numbers, he said, “we will achieve an epic victory beyond all expectations.”

He had been as upbeat as ever going into the weekend, seemingly unperturbed by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s fraud lawsuit accusing him of falsely claiming in a tweet that he had the funding lined up to go private. A settlement agreement reached Saturday requires Musk to relinquish his post as chairman for three years while allowing him to stay on as CEO.

“Ignore all distractions,” Musk said Friday in an another email to employees obtained by Bloomberg News. “One more hardcore weekend and we will be victorious.",6001,True,1538334568.0,2018-09-30 21:09:28,184,40,Potatochak,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9k9167/elon_musks_volunteer_army_out_in_force_at_buzzing/,True,0.9,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

post,9kobe4,,Are the short sellers running a campaign to lower TSLA stock price?,"I am pissed about how Elon Musk is being treated. Am I not getting it, or is this how it is?

Here is my semi-informed opinion. 

&#x200B;

Elon Musk and Tesla Motors have done amazing things so far. They have revolutionized vehicle design and manufacturing in a very short time, and singlehandedly created the market for electric cars.  


At Tesla, he set seemingly impossible goal and consistently meets it, although usually a little later than his original ambitious plan.  


They have revolutionized the auto industry and vehicle design, and are now about to earn more revenue than they are reinvesting in new vehicle design and their charging infrastructure.

&#x200B;

After a nine-month delay, they are finally meeting their ambitious production targets for the Model 3 (estimated at 53,000 for the third quarter 2018 vs 50,000 to 55,000 target).  


So, Tesla and Musk obviously deserve to be celebrated for a stunning victory for American design and manufacturing.  


But instead, they are being hounded by media, wall street and the SEC.  


That's because some very powerful people bet against Tesla, and don't want to lose money. So, they are using the government people and media that they own to bring down the company.  


If they succeed, the next American success story is less likely to happen.  


Musk and Tesla need our support.  


Reach out to your representative and Senator to let them know that you notice what the SEC is doing. Ask them why the perpetrators of the 2008 financial crisis that put about 10 million people out of jobs and their homes haven't been held accountable after 10 years, but after 1 tweet, Elon Musk has to step down from as Tesla's Chairman of the Board (and perhaps be replaced with someone of their choosing?)",1765,False,1538461591.0,2018-10-02 08:26:31,22,13,pizzamanisme,elonmusk,https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/9kobe4/are_the_short_sellers_running_a_campaign_to_lower/,True,0.9,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

post,9pb3wf,,Model X needed in San Jose for TwitchCon 2018!,"Good Morning, enthusiasts!   


I am reaching out on behalf of my client, Goodtimeswithscar (social links below). He will be traveling to San Jose, CA for the annual TwitchCon, which will be taking place October 25th through October 28th. Ryan (“Scar”) is in a wheelchair, but his companion will be helping him get to the panels he is a guest on, as well as his other speaking engagements while he is in town. The entire TwitchCon trip will be vlogged, and uploaded to his various social channels - some will even be live-streamed when necessary. He speaks on gamers with disabilities, and how he has overcome the obstacles and how others can, too. He is a member of the most successful Minecraft server community in existence, HermitCraft, which collectively sees millions of video and stream views per week across YouTube and Twitch. He also has a charity through St. Jude that provides gaming console stations to both children and adults whom have been hospitalized for serious conditions.   


He is an avid supporter of Tesla, as well as fascinated by Elon and his many endeavors. Scar wears his Boring Company cap proudly, as can be seen in some of his YouTube videos. That considered, the guy has never even sat in a Tesla!   
To make TwitchCon 2018 extra special for him, I am looking to Tesla, as well as the Tesla owner's community to see if there is any chance that you’d would be able to provide a Model X for his transportation? We would need the vehicle from Thursday afternoon (10/25), through Sunday Afternoon (10/28) - arriving at SFO, and departing from SJC. I would be the person driving him, and hold a valid California state driver’s license. The vehicle would be discussed in a positive light in some of his vlogs and live streams, which would include showing how accommodating the Model X can be of a wheelchair and travel luggage, among its many other incredible features.   


Most importantly, this would be a dream come true for him.",3303,True,1539882022.0,2018-10-18 19:00:22,0,5,Boygunasurf,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9pb3wf/model_x_needed_in_san_jose_for_twitchcon_2018/,True,0.49,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

post,9pnn1z,,Tesla makes significant changes to Model 3 versions and nixes Full Self Driving option ordering,"So as of last night Tesla made some significant changes to the actual versions of the Model 3 that can be order going forward.  They aren't selling the LR version anymore and you need to get an AWD or Perf version for the biggest battery pack.  There's now a Medium Range version with a slightly smaller battery and slightly smaller price ($45,000 w/ 260mi EPA estimated range vs $49,0000 w/ 310mi range on the prior LR version).  

Source: https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1053060766771761152

Additionally the option to order the FSD package has been completely removed.  With Elon Musk stating it was because it was causing 'confusion'.

Source: https://electrek.co/2018/10/19/tesla-removes-full-self-driving-capability-package-confusion/

This is a pretty big shakeup, perhaps even more than Elon Musk buying $20M worth of stock.  Naturally speculation is running rampant on both these issues.  If LR demand has crashed, why it was removed if this about better segmentation, etc.  And even more so on the FSD front with concerns over regulators potentially getting involved about Tesla taking money for a product they flat out haven't been able to deliver in 2 years or alternatively concerns over upgrade costs for their new hardware and chip going forward.

post,9qk2ps,,Tesla Miles Travelled vs ICE Miles Travelled per kg CO2 in California,"Eventually, we'll all have this conversation right?  Someone who knows you have a Tesla will repeat the story they've heard somewhere, ""Yeah, your Tesla's electric.  But when you take the *entire cycle of creating electricity* into account it's not as good as an efficient ICE car.""  A co-worker today challenged me.

Well, I live in California.  So I ran the numbers for California, using statistics published by the US Department of Energy.

So, according to the US Energy Information Administration ([www.eia.gov](http://www.eia.gov/)) “How much CO2 is produced per KWH?” is a FAQ. Here: [https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=74&t=11](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=74&t=11)

And they publish generation and emissions statistics per state:

[https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/emission\_annual.xls](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/emission_annual.xls)

[https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/annual\_generation\_state.xls](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/annual_generation_state.xls)

So, in 2016 California produced a total of 197 Billion kWh of electricity from all sources. (197 Million mWh)

In 2016 California emitted 47 Billion Kg of CO2 from the total electric power industry. (47 Million Metric Tons)

So, 197/47 or 4.2 kWh per kg of CO2.

On my recent road trip to Tahoe and back, I used 282 Wh per mile.  Not particularly great for a Tesla.  But it \*is\* Tahoe.

4200Wh / 282Wh/mi = 14.9 mi

*So, 14.9 miles per kg of CO2 produced.*

That’s ignoring any transmission losses, and any losses in charging the car (but the main losses are \***generation**\* losses, reflected above, not \***transmission**\* losses in the grid itself)

So, how much CO2 is produced by burning gasoline in an ICE car?

According to fueleconomy.gov – from the US Department of Energy:

**Deliveries**

As usual, Tesla’s vehicle deliveries drive most of its earning results, since vehicle sales represent the automaker’s main revenue stream at the moment.

[Tesla already confirmed its third quarter 2018 deliveries: 83,500 vehicles](https://electrek.co/2018/10/02/tesla-q3-production-deliveries/) – a new record for the company thanks to the Model 3 production ramp proving effective in yielding great numbers.

The delivery breakdown for the quarter was:

* 55,840 Model 3
* 14,470 Model S
* 13,190 Model X

Model 3 not only did well, but Model S and Model X deliveries were also both significantly higher quarter-over-quarter (those numbers are adjusted slightly during the release of the earnings).

Here are Tesla’s quarterly global deliveries of all current vehicles in production since their launches:

post,9sgfga,,If Tesla sold modular ICE conversion Kits.,"It occurred to me Tesla could pivot the entire existing 'auto - repair' industry to accelerate sustainable mobility if they started a catalog of ICE replacement components. This would allow struggling old mechanic shops to turn into 'conversion' shops, giving them a foothold in the future instead of slowly falling off the EV cliff.

* Maybe 2 sizes of motor unit that fit the space of a normal rear-axle transfer case.
   * (doesn't have to be premium power size)
   * could even include EV drive hybrid conversions that drop the transmission & but keep the existing ICE to power a much smaller battery.
* A bolt-in gas tank replacement battery pack. (not enough on its own.. but easy to fill space)
* A battery + control electronics 'block' that can replace engine + transmission of an average size.
* An 'auxiliary belt' small motor mount kit to drive AC / Pressurized systems.  (or simply electric motor driven steering / ac pumps)

Tesla is definitely the only manufacturer close to a battery cost to make 'kits' like this workable.. but if they did they could launch a whole new industry  .. once again accelerating the transition to sustainable mobility.  and at the same time picking up all the 'body & option' packages of all ICE competitors.


edit: Terrible example that probably doesn't help.   Auto-Shops become like 'Car-Toys'  replacing mechanical Tape-decks & CD players with  MP3 / BlueTooth audio decks.

post,9sk4vh,,Annoying AC compressor shutdown noise - afraid service center will tell me it’s normal,"Hey everyone! First time posting on here! I’d say I’m a pretty big Tesla enthusiast; I have an AP1 S P85D and an AP1 X P90DL, and just recently added an AP2 X 100D! The first two Teslas were absolutely perfect when I got them, so I could never really identify with all of the build quality complaints I’d seen when it came to Tesla. 

But this Model X was built right in the middle of the great Model 3 ramp, and it’s lacking in many aspects. I’ve given it to the service center to get these issues sorted out, but based on the feedback I’ve gotten from the service center thus far, I’m afraid they might refuse to fix the most annoying of them: a [very loud and deep whirring noise](https://youtu.be/DTlHod4Nbgc) that happens on its own EVERY 3-5 MINUTES when the AC is active, but can also be provoked by cranking up the AC all the way, letting it run for a bit and then shutting it off. 

In a call today, the service center representative told me that they are still in the process of determining whether or not this sound is normal. I know that this sound does not happen in neither my other Model X nor my Model S, but I don’t know what to do if they say it’s “within specifications”. 

The X is really amazing in every other way, especially with AP2 and V9, so I’d hate for this to ruin my experience. Do you have any experience with or information about this issue? Do you know what causes it, or what I can tell the service center to get it fixed?

Thanks!

SOLVED: Got it back from the service center, this is resolved now.

post,9v2xeo,,The electric future has arrived,"One of my coworkers is thinking about buying a new car. Naturally I was trying to convince her to buy the Model 3. It fits the approximate budget she and her husband have for their next car, and as a Tesla investor I took it upon myself to convince her to at least consider the Model 3. She and her husband like cars but I think they share an ignorance that the general public has about how far Tesla has come in the past few years. Her first response to the suggestion of buying a Tesla?


**""Yeah but electric cars don't have as good of performance as gas powered cars.""**


I opened up YouTube and showed her videos of the P100D beating a Ferrari, Porsche, or any number of other supercars in quarter mile drag races. Her response?


**""Oh that's interesting, but don't Teslas cost like a hundred grand?""**


Next I pulled up the Tesla website, showing the Model 3 with a 0-60 time of 3.3 seconds and a base price of $46k (edit: at the base price the Model 3 does 0-60 in 5.6 seconds). Her next line, which I knew was coming...


**""Okay but that would never work because the range isn't good enough. I couldn't drive home to visit my parents.""**


I pull up Google Maps to find the distance between her place and her parents house (DC to Greensboro, NC). 309 miles. Almost exactly the range of the Model 3.


**""That's pretty good but where do I charge it? I need to wait another 5 years or so for all the charging stations to be built!""**


I open the Tesla supercharger map and show her that there are no fewer than 8 charging stations already open along her route, conveniently located just off the highway where she is already stopping for food, bathrooms, etc. At this point she was pretty much out of rebuttals, but I could tell she was still not convinced.

post,9wlpcd,,King Copper’s Ghost: The Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Natural Resource Curse," The Democratic Republic of the Congo is currently in the midst of an Ebola outbreak that has cost the lives of 191 individuals. Although a vaccine for Ebola has finally been developed, constant warfare makes it all but impossible to distribute treatment. The recent history of the DRC has been marked by brutal series of wars that has cost of over 4 million lives, and the DRC has a per capita income under $800. This dismal picture is shocking given that Congo is blessed by rich deposits of copper, diamonds, cobalt and other national resources. Today’s podcast episode is going to focus on why Congo has been unable to translate this natural resource wealth into prosperity for ordinary people. In part one, I will discuss the paternalistic policies of the Belgian Congo and how the left the country unprepared for independence. In part two, I will discuss the corruption of the Mobutu regime, and how the mining industry collapsed under his rule. Finally, in part three I will discuss the current transformation of Congo’s mining industry, and the pivotal role the Congo will play in the rise of electric cars.

Many of my readers are likely familiar with the ruthless rule of King Leopold in the Congo Free State that cost the lives as many as 8 million Africans. If not, I strongly recommend reading [King Leopold’s Ghost](https://www.amazon.com/King-Leopolds-Ghost-Heroism-Colonial/dp/0618001905), by Adam Hochschild.

By 1960, the Belgian Congo had eradicated the tsetse fly from populated areas, and the highest literacy rate in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there was a very real dark side to Belgian rule in the Congo. Exploitation and coercion where everywhere.

post,9yku57,,Failed Delivery Process - Need to Vent and Need advice,"I've been a lurker on this sub for a while and I need to vent about the past 24 hours and ask for advice for what to do next.  I was a reservation holder for a model 3 since the day it was announced but in the last few years, my family has grown with the addition of a new child and dog.  So after much deliberation, my wife and I decided to get a new 2018 Model S 75D instead.  We were very excited for our scheduled delivery yesterday afternoon. However, we never got our car yesterday.
First, after the initial check in process and signing of paperwork, we waited at the Mt Kisco site for just under 2 hours because they had trouble registering our new car at the DMV site.  Fine.  Finally got new plates and we were shuttled over to a warehouse where they said our car would be.  It wasn't there and we had to wait there another hour until they realized it was back at the original site where we checked in.  
They finally got us to our car over 3 hours after our initially appointment time.  We were going through our walk through of the car when both screen blacked out and failed to reboot.  A couple of representatives tried rebooting the system to no avail.  Due to the fussy baby and with closing time approaching, we were told that it was probably just a software update and they would try the update in the morning and deliver it to us to our house in the afternoon.  
Got a phone call this morning saying they were ""running diagnostics"" and they should be still ok to deliver it in the afternoon.  No more updates for the rest of the morning.
I called the delivery center back and find out that they need to replace a part and now won't get delivery until Wednesday at the earliest.

post,9zsww8,,"How different people perceive value in a car, an essay of sorts.","So I realize it may seem like im talking on a soapbox here but this is a thought that i've had these thoughts in my head for a while now so I figured why not put it out there for some discussion. Think of your dream car, think of the car that makes you go ""one day!"" and then think of the price tag and why that price is justified. You ask enough people this and you will get very different answers because people have very different wants and needs when it comes to cars which is something I feel like a lot of people forget.

Here's an example, look at a new base Mustang and then look at a new base Miata. Both cars start at around 25k but both are valued for different reasons. The Mustang starts with 310 hp while the Miata starts at only 155 hp. Someone looking for 0-60 times might call the Miata a rip-off but the people who buy Miatas aren't looking for 0-60 times, they're looking for handling. While the Miata has less horsepower than a new Toyota Camry they have become almost synonymous with handling with few cars in its price range being able to handle themselves in a turn like the Miata. On the flip side the Miata would be easily destroyed in a straight drag race by the base level Mustang.

I feel like a lot of car enthusiasts view the car world only through what they desire in a car which can lead to a lot of toxicity in the community. Yes a challenger scat pack can easily beat a Lexus LS500 in a race for a fraction of the price but the $75,000 price tag of the Lexus is a result of its luxury features such as rear seat massages, climate controls that read the occupants body temperatures, etc. With the Tesla model 3 a $55,000 price tag for a car that at its slowest option only goes 0-60 in 5.5 seconds may sound like a rip off but is justified by the cutting edge tech in the car. 55k for a 5.5 second car is a ripoff but what about 55k for a car with autopilot and the ability to predict and dodge accidents on its own?",2580,True,1543013099.0,2018-11-23 23:44:59,15,19,AutumnMuffin,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/9zsww8/how_different_people_perceive_value_in_a_car_an/,True,0.8,2018,tesla,search,False,False,0,

I’m a **fanboy from Europe** since around 2014 and, as lot of You, my daily life can not be satisfied without some new video, interesting thread or news article about anything related to Elon, Tesla and SpaceX. I was a shareholder for some time, but bailed out due to me being overly emotional on **untruthful and harmful** information about person and companies I love like a family members since 2015, when Elon [with his bs promises about landing orbital rockets and delivering electric car that I can afford] kept me rooting for life.

During this period I realized that most of information Youtube and other influencers put out there is lacking a lot of facts with regards to ‘pre-this year’ information and written first hand interviews like Elon’s autobiography by A. Vance (He’s actually trying to make a movie now). The guys that actually make a good insightful information (Teslanomics, Rian, Clean Technica) does it in a way not interesting for some demography.

Also,
 I’m a biology bachelor and climate change issue for me is very personal due to first hand research experience (with regards to freshwater ecosystem).


However, what I realized is that my knowledge and enthusiasm could actually be redirected towards useful stuff during the time, when complete  content is lacking and there isn’t an easy to understand and interesting source for people who seek it. Thus, I will try to make YouTube videos (e.g. like autopilot footage explanation for people not familiar with it or are confused by its other use in planes, where it has been in development since 1912 and only recently started accomplishing such tasks as landing).

I try to maintain a running list of the current economic situation at all times since I trade based on current global news.  I'm looking for some commentary on my current list:

  

**Pros**

Super cheap oil - this helps consumer spending and emerging markets, but hurts the S&P and oil exporters (a segment of the US now). Google the article “The American Consumer Is On Track To Save $40 Billion In Annual Energy Costs”. Every one cent decrease in gas prices saves the consumer $1 billion in yearly energy costs!

Corporate tax cuts are permanent unless congress repeals them - why are people under the impression that this is a one-time stimulus and will wear off?

Potential for at least a temporary trade deal and cut in tariffs to see if China makes due on its promises (my hunch)

Low unemployment - historically this means we’re closer to the next recession though

Some pockets of potential stock value

Historically low interest rates

Household debt ratio is OK

**Cons**

Trump instability.

Russia investigation. 

Strong dollar - hurts US exports and emerging markets. Where will this be in 2019?

Market pessimism and downward momentum

Global growth worries - will these prove to be well justified in affecting US corporate profits?

Yield curve is flattening, though historically it has been this flat and growth continues for years to come

Fed balance sheet unwind - Fed needs to sell lots of securities. Low treasury prices drive up safe yields and make bonds look more attractive, driving down stock prices. 

Fed raising interest rates, though rates are still low historically speaking.

QE unwind. Will bonds end up getting crushed eventually?

Trade war - who long will it go on and what will be the effect? Will Trump fold because of the stock market crashing?

Brexit

Isolationism getting popular hurting trade and the global economy

Isn't an all-EV car supposed to be simpler to make and repair than a conventional ICE car and certainly easier than a hybrid (which has both technologies)? If I remember correctly hybrid tech became available in 1900 and some hybrid tanks were even made during WWII. The technology has been reliable and available to consumers since at least as far back as the Gen I Prius (2001). Seems to me that these days cars don't change much except in terms of gadgets and onboard 3G/4G LTE with the exception of some new transmissions being tried out (Nissan Versa CVT) and in the case of EVs new battery tech, but I don't think Musk invented any new battery tech, they just copied the most modern commercially available tech to get the most energy density. So my questions are:

1. Why are EVs still so expensive? It's literally not worth it to buy them unless you're a cab driver stuck in stand-still traffic daily.
2. Why did Musk have so much difficulty perfecting the car for the factory when logically it would seem an EV would be easier to make?

Does anyone know of a disassembly reference for Model 3's? Chilton's doesn't write manuals for Teslas.

* * *

Tesla disappointed investors Tuesday, saying it delivered less vehicles than expected during the fourth quarter despite efforts to ramp up production.

Its shares fell by about 5 percent in premarket trading.

Tesla previously gave investors hope that its production rates would improve, saying that the number of labor hours to build the Model 3 fell by more than 30 percent from the second to the third quarter. The company also told investors in late October that it took less time to build than the Model S sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle — another first for the company.

""We will focus even further on cost improvements while continuing to increase our production rate"" during the fourth quarter, the company said at the time.

CEO Elon Musk announced Oct. 23 that the company planned to limit certain options on its higher-end Model S sedans and Model X SUVs to streamline production. The company also announced plans during the fourth quarter to start selling a $45,000 version of the Model 3, before raising the price $46,000. It has yet to produce the base Model 3, which it has promised for a price of $35,000 before incentives.

The fourth quarter marked an end to a $7,500 federal tax credit that Tesla was able to use to lure buyers in the past. That was cut in half to $3,750 starting Jan. 1.",1406,False,1546436557.0,2019-01-02 14:42:37,845,361,closingbell,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/abti79/tesla_misses_wall_street_estimates_with_90700/,True,0.93,2019,both,search,False,False,0,

post,adxl0r,,C7 Grand Sport Owner's Review of a 2016 Tesla Model X,"So I got married this weekend and my friend decided to rent a 90D Tesla Model X for the wedding to help chauffeur family members around. I ended up driving the car for about (3) days and here are my impressions on the following: Power, Handling, Practicality, Style, Build Quality, and Overall Driving Experience. 

**Power (Powah!)** 

I drove a Model X 90D a few years ago at a Tesla dealership when looking for a new car for my dad. I was impressed with the power then, but the dealership driving experience was only about 15 minutes and was very much about showing all of the car's features so it was hard to really get a grasp for the car's power. 

In driving it around the past few days I got a much better sense of the car's power delivery and it is pretty enjoyable. 

The electric motors and AWD system give the car a near instantaneous and perfectly tractioned power delivery at all times. You put the pedal down and you begin to feel the car surge forward in proportion to how much throttle you are giving it. 

We've all heard the stories of Teslas slaying other cars in drag races and torching nearly everyone from 0-60. The 90D has a 0-60 time slated at around 4.8 seconds, which is fast but nowhere near legendary, but to be honest the car felt much stronger than that. 

A big reason for this is because the Model X doesn't have to change gears and can respond to throttle input very rapidly. Sure other cars can do 0-60 in say 4 seconds, but they have to be in the right gear, with the right surface, and with enough traction to make that pull possible. Too much throttle input and the car breaks traction, too little and you missed your shot at the perfect 4 seconds. 

With the Model X when you put your foot down the car immediately goes ""alright this is the maximum amount of power I can give you without breaking traction"" and I've never seen a car react so quickly to driver input.",28641,True,1546973685.0,2019-01-08 19:54:45,50,70,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/adxl0r/c7_grand_sport_owners_review_of_a_2016_tesla/,True,0.73,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,am7nz5,,Business Start Up - Clean Out/Clean Up Crew - Willing to Trade Expertise,"To begin, I managed the day to day operations at a small transportation company, specifically semi trucks, for about 7-8 years and still manage the company's financials from home. I basically pay the bills, make sure the day to day manager has money to make the business function properly for the week, and balance the checking account. It's something my dad started while I was in school and I took over in 2008 when I graduated. It has had its up and downs but I can't complain, I put about two hours a week into it and it pays almost all our bills.

&#x200B;

Late 2015, I noticed I was playing on my phone far more than I was actually working. My dad raised my brother and I doing construction and home remodeling. I asked him to teach me because I was no longer needed at the trucking company on a regular basis. Fast forward about 3 years and here we are building pole barns, remodeling/flipping homes, and doing almost everything you could do under a residential roof five days a week. He's 62 years old and has really dropped out of the work lineup for us as of late. He is suppose to cap some windows tomorrow but we'll see if it really happens. He deserves a nice retirement. I like him being able to come and go and not worry about the jobs. I owe him a lot.

&#x200B;

Another business venture I have been reading about is working with banks and homeowners and cleaning out repossessed homes. This led me to researching crime set cleanup (murder, suicide, drugs, etc). I'm not even sure what the proper name of the profession is called. However, I'm interested.

&#x200B;

Why I am posting here is because I want to expand myself. I want to start a clean out/clean up business but I know little of how to get started. Of course I am going to need a vendors' license, insurance, bond, etc. but I am not too sure how I could get my foot in the door quickly.

post,apd855,,Discussion - How Will Enthusiasts Modify Electric Vehicles?,"What follows below are my thoughts on how you can modify EVs for better performance after doing some research online. Obviously, I want to hear from you guys about how else you could go about modding an EV. I know a lot of you out there are quite knowledgeable. That being said, here's my two cents:

As electric vehicles take over pretty much every market segment - everything from commuter cars to high performance side-by-sides (Nikola NZT) - there will eventually be those who wish to modify electric vehicles for better performance, and thus, an aftermarket will form to cater to them. This will probably become commonplace as more used electric vehicles enter the market. The question is, how do you go about modifying an electric vehicle in the first place? In comparison to an ICE vehicle, EVs are very simple. There isn't as much to modify in general. There are certain mods that will be exactly the same as they are today; weight reduction, suspension, wheels, gear ratio changes, etc. But what about the powertrain itself?

\- REFLASHING:

Similar to ECU tuning  today, software modification could allow for better performance as many EVs come de-tuned from factory. The Nissan Leaf Nismo is an example of this. The only difference between the standard Leaf and the Nismo is a body kit, wheels, and a software reprogram.

\- HIGHER VOLTAGE CABLES

As you begin working with more power, the rest of the drivetrain will need to be up to par. Higher voltage cables could be a ""Stage 1"" mod in the future, similar to installing new valves/valve springs as you build an engine. 

\- AFTERMARKET CONTROLLERS/COMPUTERS

The EV equivalent of a standalone ECU (like a MoTeC). These would allow you full control over tuning the car yourself rather than needing to reprogram the stock computer. An example of this today is the EV West Tesla Motor kit which comes with an aftermarket controller that allows for fine-tuning.",3481,True,1549864603.0,2019-02-11 06:56:43,10,24,SquidBonez,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/apd855/discussion_how_will_enthusiasts_modify_electric/,True,0.73,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,aqyaw5,,Converting Gas Stations to Energy Banks?,"So I've been playing with the idea of BEVs taking over in the coming years and the drawdown of ICE support like old fashioned fuel pumps. 
Given how it's uncertain if gas stations will be able to afford staying open, I had a thought that electric converted gas stations (equipped with powerwall type storage options) could plug into local utilities and act as the neighborhood failsafes like in the case of surges, blackouts or high demand.
Additionally you could add solar to the gas station and/or top up the on-site storage overnight (lower rates if sourced from utilities) to resell at higher rates later. 
A way for the owners of these stations to make money from the failsafe service could be a monthly fee paid by utility customers. This would be in combination with the BEV charging stalls.

* The U.S. represents 55.1% of the equity market, versus 44.9% for international, as of Sept. 2018. [Image](https://i.imgur.com/9C0RIpU.png).
* U.S. stocks have the lowest volatility of any country, but a **global market provides the lowest volatility**. [Image](https://i.imgur.com/xUGAI4a.png).
* Vanguard's data suggests **maximum volatility reduction was achieved with a 40-50% international allocation** (but why not just invest in a global market cap weighted index?).
* **Emerging markets should be market weighted, too**. They have delivered ""higher average returns, albeit with higher volatility, than those of developed markets."" However, individual EMs are uncorrelated, so the risk of investing in all of them is lower.
* **Currency exposure risks from international investing are minimal**, and in some cases, reduce volatility.
* **U.S. investors don't benefit as much from international as investors in other countries**. Vanguard's ten year, forward-looking model showed maximum volatility reduction in the U.S. at 4%, the UK at 9%, Canada at 11%, and Australia at 15% (roughly). [Image](https://i.imgur.com/9qudtX3.png).
* **Over-weighting U.S. or international stocks leads to sector overexposure and risk**. U.S. companies skew towards technology, biotech, and software, while other countries have more ""old world"" industries such as electrical equipment and automobiles (Vanguard's 2012 study).

**How to use it?**

1. Choose the cars you want to compare or analyze the entire market. You have a whole set of filters at your disposal. Filter by body style, price, make, status, drive type or DC charging capability.
2. Select the specs to be shown on each axis. The following options are available: Range, Battery pack capacity, Acceleration, Engine Power, Engine Torque and Efficiency.
3. Watch how do different electric models compare on your custom chart and discover interesting interrelations and trends.
4. Hover on a car to see more info. Click on it to go to the model page, which contains detailed a description, high-quality photos, video reviews, safety ratings and Disqus widget to share your impression with other EV Compare users.

**Interesting observations  at a glance**

 1. Range and battery pack capacity are closely related (what a surprise). But look how far the Tesla Roadster concept has gone!

2. There is only a slight correlation between range and MSRP. So the higher price does not necessarily mean greater range. What’s more, there is a noticeable gap in the middle, which signifies a lack of mid-range EVs.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said they are sending teams to investigate a fatal crash in Florida on Friday involving a Tesla car and a semi-trailer.

The two agencies are investigating several crashes involving the use of Tesla's driver assistance system Autopilot including another fatal crash in California in March 2018.",705,False,1551536668.0,2019-03-02 15:24:28,15,27,coolcomfort123,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/awi88c/us_safety_agencies_to_investigate_fatal_tesla/,True,0.67,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,awl9v5,,Unpopular opinion: Manuals are overrated and crap for daily driving,"Upfront disclaimer: I own two cars, both are manuals.

Driving a new Audi A3, the current BMW or Mercedes (they never had good manuals, I know) I still think a manual transmission is completely overrated if you drive your car as a daily that brings you to work and the shops.
Manuals suck in traffic, they can’t have all the nice things (like autopilot-ish features) and they got even worse in the last years with manufacturers trying to improve them with some clutch assistants and so on.

post,awnza4,,Fatal Tesla Model 3 Crash in Florida Prompts Investigations by Federal Agencies," ""A preliminary police report from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office obtained by [Electrek](https://electrek.co/2019/03/01/tesla-driver-crash-truck-trailer-autopilot/)  said the collision occurred at an intersection off Florida State Road 7  near Pero Family Farms. The 2018 Tesla Model 3 was reportedly headed  southbound at the time that a tractor-trailer, pulling out of a driveway  leading to Pero Family Farms after stopping at a stop sign, attempted  to turn left onto the highway headed northbound. 

At that time the tractor-trailer entered the path of the Tesla, and  the latter hit the driver’s side of the trailer, “resulting in the roof  being sheared off as it passed underneath the trailer,” the report said.  The 50-year-old Tesla driver died on the scene, per Reuters. It is not  clear whether the Tesla’s Autopilot mode was active at the time of the  collision.

Per the police report, the Tesla Model 3 continued for  nearly a third of a mile before coming to a complete stop. As several  reports have noted, the incident bears remarkable similarities to [another fatal crash](https://gizmodo.com/fatal-tesla-crash-proves-full-autonomy-is-the-only-solu-1782923424) involving a Tesla Model S that occurred in Florida in 2016.""

What will we look back on several decades later and say ""That's so 2020s."" When people watch 'retro' movies from the decade in the 2060s, what about cars in the old movies will stand out to them as being characterized by that decade? In the same mold that tailfins = 1950s and giant slab = 1970s, what will be X = 2020s.

post,ayqhd1,,Discrimination against Tesla Owners at KC Auto Show!,"Wednesday a group of automotive enthusiasts (myself included) brought random cars that we own to Bartle Hall in Kansas City to put on display at the annual Kansas City Auto Show (think LA or Detroit Auto Show but smaller, although Bartle Hall is huge). Since the auto show doesn't fill the entire hall the group that runs the auto show (Automobile Dealer Association of Kansas City) granted the south end of the exhibit hall to the Kansas City Auto Museum to bring in cars of interest to attendees. The museum reached out to the local auto enthusiast community and were able to get volunteers like myself willing to bring our cars and leave them from 3/6-3/10 for the show.  The cars would hopefully attract people at the show to the KC Auto Museum booth and in turn the museum itself.

Unfortunately two individuals brought Teslas, one Model S and one Model X and about an hour after bringing them, parking them and getting them display ready someone from the ADAKC came by and said that because Tesla isn't a member of the ADAKC (basically meaning Tesla has no dealerships so therefore we don’t like Tesla) that the two Teslas on display would have to leave, they were not welcome at the show. The owners subsequently had to remove the cars that they are enthusiastic about. There were other cars on display whose manufacturers are also not part of the ADAKC, for example Noble, Pontiac, Ariel and Lamborghini to name a few, but those cars were not asked to leave. Since Tesla was being singled out I authored the following email to the two directors of the association: (I’m hoping Reddit can draw attention to this matter)

[https://i.redd.it/dm2xei0ch7m21.png](https://i.redd.it/dm2xei0ch7m21.png)

How does that objectively compare to the Hyundai Kona?

**Kona Pros:**

* The Model Y will have 230 miles of range, while the Kona has 258
* Comparing base model prices, the Kona is about $2,000 cheaper
* The base Kona is becoming available now, while the base Model Y won't be for another 2 years

**Neutral Points:**

* The Model Y has longer ranged & faster options, but at significant additional costs

**Model Y Pros:**

* Access to the Tesla Supercharging Network
* Slightly faster acceleration with the base model
* The Kona has very limited availability, even if it is considered a 2019 model year vehicle

You could even compare the Chevy Bolt to the Model Y, where the Bolt was providing a bit more range for less price in a crossover style years ago. I know there are more factors -- and I'm curious to here what you consider important -- but I'm rather unimpressed with the Model Y reveal. Competition will be heating up with VW & Chevy putting more resources into electric vehicles, in addition to Electrify America programs (which is all a good thing) -- makes me wonder how ""on top"" Tesla will continue to be (investors also seem to be worrying the same, taking a look at the stock after the reveal).

**Don't get me wrong.

Edit: Automod said to include some information, not sure if I need to include a synopsis, but basically the article is going into detail about what the headline makes pretty clear. After the store closings, non store closings, layoffs, and recent bond payments, this looks like another piece of evidence for Tesla running out of cash.

Kind of a shame too, I love Elon Musk as a visionary and I think his companies are overall doing good things for the human race and the planet. Unfortunately, that alone doesn't pay your creditors. I wish they would have taken things slower and kept their focus on the luxury market until they were really ready to attack the mass market, or maybe do some kind of incremental or regional releases until they can scale properly.

Edit 2: A family member is a contractor for Tesla and hasn't received this email so it must be strictly to payroll employees. Waiting to hear back from him to see if ""volunteer"" means you still get paid normal wages but move over to deliveries temporarily, or if it means work for free.

_________________________
Edit 3: Since people can't get past this argument on what ""volunteer"" means and Tesla has not made it clear yet, I suggest you all look to the past implementation of this (since many of you are also claiming this has been done before and so it's okay). An article from [March 2018](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/elon-musk-wants-volunteer-employees-to-help-prove-teslas-haters-wrong) explains how the ""volunteering"" was carried out:

post,b2od88,,PHEV Buy or Wait Advice,"I realize this is probably overdone, but hoping to get some advice for my specific situation from the experts and enthusiasts here.

Here's my situation:  I live in an area with abysmal EV charging options. There is exactly one public, non-Tesla charger in our city of 80,000 (three more at a few hotels) and it's reportedly broken the majority of the time. Likewise, the dealerships here rarely sell (or service, which is important) PHEV/EV options and when they do, they have no clue how they work. I commute \~21 miles round trip 5 days a week to work. I own my home, can install a 240V Level 2 charger without an issue. About once every two months, I'm driving about \~300 miles round trip to one of two major metro areas nearby (Houston and New Orleans). Both seem to have some charging infrastructure, but I'm not sure if I can get over my anxiety about having to plan trips around where I'm going to park or how to get my car charged when I valet parked it downtown. My wife's anxiety about this is about 100x worse than mine. We also have kids, but we take our van everywhere for them. I'm committed to getting either a PHEV or EV as my next vehicle. I'm aiming around the $15k-25k mark for something lightly used. My current daily driver is a 2011 Sonata with 110,000 miles. My tax liability last year was very low, not enough to make the tax incentive attractive.

There's a good deal on a 2017 Chevy Volt Premier (no ACC) with low mileage at a local dealership that I'm eyeballing for $20k. I wish the legroom in the back and the trunk space was larger, but it would work. I'm overwhelmed with all the other PHEV options out there though and still considering going all-in with an EV.

Thoughts? Should I just wait it out another 1-2 years and let the used market get a bit more flushed with options?

post,bjphfc,,I test drove A Tesla Model 3 Standard Range here is my Review.,"**Experience**: Everyone at the Jacksonville Tesla Showroom were very friendly and they appreciated that I showed up to the test drive early. They answered any questions I had with no delays. The test drive went smoother than expected Friberiro (employee at Showroom) helped make this a test drive to remember.


**Previous car**: 2013 BMW 328i ZF 8-speed ( I really don’t miss this car)


**Current car**: Honda Civic EX-T’16 CVT



*Note*: This is my opinion based on one test drive. If I said the wrong information for the touch screen or anything else please correct me.



*Duration of test drive*: 1:05 pm to 1:45 pm 40 minutes 



*Type of driving*: Mixed driving intercity traffic, interstate driving and the suburb's 



**Cons**



**The doors closing**- When you close them it makes a loud clank sound. The showroom Model 3 actually made a louder sound than the test car I drove. The sound makes it seem like the doors are going to break every time you close them. 



**The ride quality**- I expected the quality to be slightly better. ( it may have to do with the tester riding on 19 in chrome wheels). Did not ride over bumps as well as expected. I felt light thuds when riding over bumps or road inconsistencies sometimes.




**Neutral**



**The Higher floor**- The higher floor of the car (due to the battery being low in the car) bother me in the first minutes of the test drive but I got used to it. The higher floor will hamper back seat room, I'm 6'1 sitting in the back seat I felt I had solid knee room and 2 inches of headroom I have a 3-inch tall Mohawk (although the front seat at that current setting was somewhat of a tight squeeze). The higher floor helps with visibility.




**The Speaker** - The sound system in this car is solid. But I don't get to test cars to often also I had the stereo volume low throughout the ride.

post,bkho9j,,Tesla Model 3 AWD vs. C7 Corvette Grand Sport,"I’ve been daily driving Corvettes for the past (7) years or so. I had 5 years in an old C5 Corvette and spent the last two years in a C7 Grand Sport. While I *love* Corvettes my life has slowly become more complicated to the point where daily driving a C7 Grand Sport has been less and less of a joy.

Now don’t get me wrong, Corvettes are the most daily-able sports cars you can get. Plenty of trunk room, an honest 30mpg if you drive them calmly, the cars are reliable, and they are generally affordable to repair/maintain. For me though, I just recently got married, moved to a place that made for a commute that was a bit more tedious than it was fun, and in general was beginning to feel a bit limited/stressed out when driving my Corvette (more on that later). So I decided to trade in my C7 Grand Sport for a Tesla Model 3 non-performance AWD. Here are my thoughts!

**Buying Experience**:

Buying a Tesla is a generally seamless and enjoyable experience, but there are some points that are a bit unnerving.

Test driving a Tesla is literally as easy as walking into your nearest store and saying“Hi I want to test drive this model”, and 5 minutes later you’re behind the wheel of whatever models they have available. The sales staff is generally pretty friendly, helpful, and polite, and there is very minimal if any sales pressure.

Compared to your typical dealership experience, where you often have to deal with a salesman sizing you up, etc. This is a much better way to test-drive a vehicle. For instance if you want to drive a 100K+ Model S P100D the answer is “Absolutely, let me grab your co-pilot and do you want any water while we wait?” as opposed to “well let’s see if you can afford it first”

The actual ordering experience is a bit odd/sketchy at times.

 I can see the massive amount of money being spent on long term infrastructure and when you think about it, who else has a network of superchargers like Tesla’s ? There’s a possibility competitors will need to use Tesla’s supercharges and they’ll have to reach an agreement with them. Demand for the Model 3 is massive, their problem is not being able to pump them out in time, which yes is a problem but it’s better than having them all finished and no one buying ?

""**Motor Mouth: These days, Tesla’s biggest problem is its fan club**

**The real impediment to growing sales of electric vehicles is the intransigence of the clientele**

by [DAVID BOOTH ](https://driving.ca/author/motocanada) | 15 HOURS AGO

It’s time to finally acknowledge as fact what many of us have long suspected — Tesla groupies are perhaps the kookiest cult this side of the Jim Jones fan club.

Now, blind loyalty in the face of facts does have its benefits. After all, it just got a U.S. president elected. Indeed, burying your head in the sand is the most common of human reactions to adversity; just ask any man confronted — stand up and take a bow, *former* president Bill Clinton — with seemingly irrefutable evidence of infidelity. But the last few days have seen the Teslarati raise the stakes in aberrance. Indeed, considering Elon Musk’s latest prognostications, the reaction of the faithful is akin to Reverend Jim, suddenly beset by something approaching a conscience, tossing away his pitcher of Kool-Aid only to have his devotees cook up another batch themselves.

This latest divorce from reality started about a month ago when Lord Elon, not content with his latest exaggerations of electric car dominance and space-time travel, upped the ante with predictions that Tesla would have “a million cars with full self-driving” capabilities on the road by next year and that, in two years, “we’ll make a car with no steering wheel or pedals.”

Now, never mind that deadly crashes directly attributable with the company’s Autopilot system are at least partly responsible for the recent chilling in autonomous automobile development, devotees cheered the news as yet more tablets from the mount. ARK analyst James Wang said Musk’s decision to bring autonomous chip design in-house would put Tesla four years ahead of its competition.",5891,True,1558505332.0,2019-05-22 08:08:52,0,17,skidz007,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/brl50l/wow_just_wow_who_is_this_david_booth_anyways/,True,0.47,2019,both,search,False,False,0,

To: Everybody

As of yesterday, we had over 50,000 net new orders for this quarter. Based on current trends, we have a good chance of exceeding the record 90,700 deliveries of Q4 last year and making this the highest deliveries/sales quarter in Tesla history!

In order to achieve this, we need sustained output of 1,000 Model 3’s per day. Almost all parts of the Model 3 production system have exceeded 1000 units on multiple days (congratulations!!) and we’ve averaged about 900/day this week, so we’re only about 10% away from 7000/week.

&#x200B;

There are many speculations what this could be, and I find it interesting that they aren't announcing it through Twitter, [tesla.com](https://tesla.com) or any other mainstream way. To me, this looks like an ""under the radar"" announcement. Could ofc. be hyped up more until Friday.

The China factory is expected to be completed soon, and there are rumors that they are starting to hire for Shanghai Giga. Last time they made a ""surprise announcement"" like this, the stock had some bullish days before it took a drop after the announcement of model Y.

This announcement seems to be China only, and even if you look at the teaser picture, it looks a lot like a vehicle (in my view). To announce the whole factory like this is also a little weird.  Is this a new model, or eventually an own version of model 3 for the Chinese market? Tesla Roadster or more info on model Y?

The pick-up truck seems unlikely since it should be aimed at the US market. Tesla semi I still possible, and we haven't heard too much of it.

The Chinese text on the picture apparently states "" preparing for quick release of accumulated power "". Sounds a like it could be about super-chargers, but the picture doesn't make too much sense in that regard.

post,by0g2p,,Need some advice from fellow car enthusiast when it comes to deciding between your head and your heart,"This might be a longer read so I appreciate anyone who actually bothers reading this. I thank you.

For everyone else

**TL;DR**\- Discovered my love for cars. Got myself a 2018 Honda Civic Type R. Traded it in for a Lexus IS-F half a year later thinking I made an upgrade. Realized after months that I made a huge mistake. Have a Hyundai i30 Fastback N now and like the car but don't really love it. Heart still beats for that Type R that I foolishly gave up but getting one in the near future would be another irrational decision.

&#x200B;

So I used to own a Toyota Yaris Hybrid and it was a good, reliable and cost efficient car and I paid it off completely in the end. For other people that would have been the end already but of course it wasn't very exciting to drive and I discovered the car enthusiast in myself so I traded it in for a brand new 2018 Honda Civic Type R and financed the rest. I was a JDM fan since I was a kid so getting one of those shouldn't be that surprising. I don't think I have to talk to much about the car because what basically every review or person who has driven it has said is true. It's just a marvel and I never had such a good time as when I owned that car. All kinds of strangers would check out the car or would walk up to me and ask me about it and would even talk about their own cars. Fellow car enthusiasts who you wouldn't even recognize as such and would never come it contact with otherwise. Truly a great time.

&#x200B;

Then the Lexus IS-F happened. I saw one at a dealer near me for roughly the same price as I paid for the Type R. Just with the difference that the Type R was new while the IS-F was a 8 year old used one that was well taken care of though. On paper it was an upgrade in so many ways and after the test drive that I did out of curiosity I was basically intoxicated so I traded my 6 months old Type R against that car.",6314,True,1559944853.0,2019-06-08 00:00:53,4,6,the-real-Galerion,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/by0g2p/need_some_advice_from_fellow_car_enthusiast_when/,True,0.83,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,c06af6,,A year of owning a Model S and why I'm ditching it for a Model 3 now.,"Bought a 100D Model S last June after a long time waiting for a good performing electric car to come out and compete, eventually deciding that real competition was still too far away for me to wait.  I am absolutely not a member of the Cult of Elon and quite frankly think he's a little unhinged.  That said, I do like the cars and what they offer, even with their issues.  I weighed the options of getting a 100D or a long-range Model 3 at the time, but ultimately landed on the S because the wait for a 3 a year ago was still a big unknown to me, and they were still fairly new and untested, versus the ""more mature"" Model S.

I scored what seemed like a decent deal on an end of quarter inventory S at the time, so I was pretty happy to start with.  Looking back, I wish I had done a little more research and put more thought into it before going with inventory vs newly built.

Issue #1 was that instead of a 2018 model, this was a late 2017 build (November specifically).  So that probably hurt its overall value a fair amount, but the discount was deep enough I figured to make it worth it.  I was well aware of all of this.  Issue #2 that I wasn't really aware of was that this late 2017 build car meant that it was still an ""MCU1"" car, meaning it was built with the older, inferior computer driving the infotainment, nav, etc.  The autopilot hardware was current for the time though (AP 2.5).  The older MCU wasn't really a noticeable issue for the first 4 or 5 months with the car, until it got the big version 9 update that came with a reworked UI to more closely match the Model 3's UI.  After that, performance issues have been a way of life.  Stuttering music streaming (Slacker sucks, BTW), slow navigation response sometimes, voice control rarely ever works (won't even initialize and listen for a command half the time), etc.",5849,True,1560435021.0,2019-06-13 16:10:21,154,351,Algeradd,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/c06af6/a_year_of_owning_a_model_s_and_why_im_ditching_it/,True,0.78,2019,both,search,False,False,0,

Service Summary: they replaced the charge port carrier assembly, seat belt buckle, high voltage controller, 12v battery, and the TESLA battery.

Before leaving I asked a couple questions:

\- Immersive sound: I originally ""complained"" saying the rear deck, A pillar speakers, and side mirror speakers do not output any sound with or without immersive sound and that immersive sound did nothing. (I know SR+ doesn't have the extra speakers, just wanted to see what they said). Technician said they tested everything and their pc showed ""all green"". He personally said none of the techs could hear the difference with immersive sound on or off and that's just how it is. He mentioned it could be for future audiophiles who want to upgrade/add sub+amp from TSLA which kind of made sense. Kind of prepares you for it...??

\- FSD Refund: I am one of the people who bought FSD before the 'supposed' price hike on May 1. Purchased on May 1 in the morning. Later found out it's 6k flat before or after delivery. I complained to the SC that I deserve a refund due to the fact that my car has been with them for over 2 months and I was not able to experience FSD due to delay after delay. After I picked up my car today, the manager called me saying they'll be issuing me a check for partial refund on FSD (\~$1500; $7k+fees - $6k)

&#x200B;

post,c0oc9o,,How owning a Tеsla changed my life <in a energy/soul crushing daily commute>,"This story was posted by the user xtheory on a certain other sub, but I thought a few of you may find it interesting if your commute is as stressful as this guy.

I guess it's more a praise of AutoPilot rather than Tesla per se, so it's very possible other cars with advanced self-driving (either existing or in future) will have the same benefits.

-----------------

Many of us here talk about the features of our cars, the newest firmware update, the little problems (and sometimes big), and nuances of owning and driving a Tesla. But I want to shift the conversation for just a moment and speak to how owning a Tesla has impacted my life as a whole. I emphatically encourage anyone else here to share your story, good or bad, as well. So here goes...

I commute about 3 hours a day in heavy LA traffic. Next to NYC, it's probably the most grueling nightmare of lane changes, starting and stopping, praying to the Gods of Sidestreets that you can make it home with a fraction of your sanity still intact in the US. The HOV lanes are a small reprieve at times, but often just as congested as the regular ones. On any given day, most of us that live here probably in jest wish for a quick death to end it all just so we don't have to sit in another hour of traffic; yet somehow we prevail to drive another day. We drove our dumb cars, in dumb traffic, with dumb people, and even dumber gas prices. This was our plight, and yet we were resigned to it, even though with every breathe we said ""Dear Lord, why me? What did I do to deserve this?"" We returned home fatigued, haggard, with barely enough energy to cook a good meal for ourselves or our families. We fell asleep during movie night with our significant others because the road took what life we had left in us at the end of a long work day.

post,c2wc90,,"There aren't a lot of Model 3 reviews from ""traditional"" car enthusiasts, so I wrote my own","While I know the Model 3 has been out for 2 years now, it seems a lot of reviews are from Tesla fans and not so much “traditional” car enthusiasts, so I thought I’d write a review voicing my opinions. That, plus I want my thoughts recorded for my own posterity.

For some time now, I’ve been considering purchasing a Tesla Model 3. I’m generally a more frugal car enthusiast, and spending $39.9k on any other car would be nuts to me, but the Tesla at least on paper offers a lot to like: there’s of course the instant acceleration at any speed, but there’s also the super low CoG, lack of distractions in the cabin (so you can focus on driving!), no warm-up and cool-down procedures, OTA updates that occasionally bring performance and range increases, and no guilt associated with lots of unnecessary driving, which I personally do value. I was also very tempted by Autopilot, since there are times I just don’t care to drive and would be perfectly happy to let the car do the work.

So, to assuage my curiosity, I rented a long-range RWD model for two days from Turo. I spent a couple minutes adjusting settings, drove off, and… instantly hated it. Right off the bat:

* I could not for the life of me get the seat into a comfortable position. The seat bottom was bolstered too much and cut into my thigh, the pressure on my back was awful no matter where I put the lumbar support, and the headrest intrudes forwards and *doesn’t adjust at all* so when sitting upright, your head actually touches the seat before your shoulders do. Try to put your shoulders against the seat too, and you end up sitting like a hunchback. I absolutely *hated* this, and despite frequently adjusting the seat throughout the two days, I couldn’t make it any better.

* The driver’s mirror doesn’t adjust far enough out.

The business made absolutely no money (it actually lost money considering start-up cost, and bank fee for low balance). I lost contact with the other owner (let's call him Bryan)  about 3 months ago, and I found out that the bank account is negative $600 and the bank contacted me to pay since I am 50% responsible for financial transactions. I talked to Bryan and he has been using the money for some purchases and has not been taking proper care of the business. I now want take full control of the business and he want's $700 in claims that's his investment back for the business. I only am offering him $100, because he didn't do shit with the business while I was putting in most of the work. Now he wants to pay me $100 to give up my equity so he can take full ownership. I stated no, because I would want my full investment back as well. We both own 50/50 and it's a 2 member managed LLC in Florida. He lives in Rhode Island,  but I live in Florida and I take care of most of the business operations. Now that I am making money in my other ventures, I want to take this business and change it up to make money as well. I can't when he is eligible for 50% of everything that comes in.

post,cowzl5,,Lithium market flood and Panasonic stocks & strategy,"TLDR: Do you consider Panasonic a good stock to buy?

I am setting up my portfolio and am looking into the exposure to the Electric Vehicle, Battery and Energy markets. I was looking into some stocks and put these pieces together. Please tell me if it sounds farfetched.

My rationale: Panasonic produces batteries in partnership with Tesla, signed an agreement with Toyota to produce EV batteries starting 2020 and the stock is down to 2016 levels. Lithium is predicted to flood the Market coming from China, Australia and Latin America, cutting the price of the raw material considerably (\~50%). Panasonic - being a major consumer of Lithium for its production - expects a major increase in output (Toyota partnership and Teslas' Gigafactory expansion) and a drop in raw material cost. Also, Panasonic produces competitively-priced solar panels, which may see an increase in demand due to the energy requirements of EVs (shifting from gas to electricity) which shows no sign of slowing down.

So, I am inclined to buying some Panasonic stocks while still expecting some initial downturn (as to not try and time the market).

post,cww5d2,,Why Investors Should Forget About Nuclear Power (xPost from /r/uninsurable),"https://www.energyandcapital.com/articles/why-investors-should-forget-about-nuclear-power/93263

""They say Hollywood is to blame.

They say producers played it “fast and loose” with the technical details.

But even if that were the case, it doesn’t change the fact that the 1986 Chernobyl disaster was caused by human error that resulted in nearly 20,000 cases of confirmed thyroid cancer with no real accurate tally of deaths connected to the accident.

To put that in perspective, that’s more than twice the population of Park City, Utah.

Lackluster safety protocols and flawed reactor designs, which were not uncommon under communist practices that oftentimes didn’t include accuracy and precision, led to this disaster. And while I maintain that it is not the splitting of isotopes that’s the problem, but rather the inability of humans to responsibly operate nuclear power plants in an economically feasible manner, nuclear power has been a very effective form of baseload power for decades. But at least in the U.S., those days are coming to an end.

The bottom line is that nuclear power is simply not economically sustainable.

This, dear reader, is why Exelon recently announced that it would be retiring the Three Mile Island nuclear power facility 15 years early.

It has nothing to do with Hollywood, and it has nothing to do with the Three Mile Island emergency that scared the crap out of us all back in 1979.

Plain and simple...
It’s All About the Money

There is one main reason nuclear power no longer has a future in the U.S.

And I’ll tell you about it in just a moment.

But first, let’s dispel this myth that nuclear power is cheap, as it’s never been able to survive without massive subsidies.

As reported by UCS, the nuclear industry is only able to portray itself as a low-cost power supplier today because of past government subsidies and write-offs.",6222,True,1567053906.0,2019-08-29 06:45:06,0,6,dongasaurus_prime,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cww5d2/why_investors_should_forget_about_nuclear_power/,True,0.21,2019,elon,search,False,False,0,

Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) says a former employee who allegedly hacked its confidential manufacturing operating system and leaked trade secrets to media caused a $167 million drop in Tesla’s market capitalization during a two-day period June 2018.

The alleged stock dip is claimed by Tesla’s expert CPA and damages analyst in an exhibit filed by Tesla this week in a pending federal lawsuit in Nevada against the former Gigafactory technician, Martin Tripp.

“In the brief period of trading that took place between the publication of each of the June 4 Article and June 6 Article and the close of the NASDAQ trading day, Tesla’s market capitalization declined by $34 million and $134 million, respectively, or $167 million in total over those two short time windows,” the filing states.",869,False,1567231568.0,2019-08-31 08:06:08,358,46,coolcomfort123,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/cxsi78/tesla_says_its_exemployee_caused_167_million_drop/,True,0.97,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,czve4f,,Suggestion: Indicate inability to communicate with sensors as part of the self-test when shifting out of park,"I took delivery of my Model 3 SR+ a week ago and about 2 days in noticed a lack of external temperature and some other issues. Posting here and searching the web indicated it was likely the front bumper was unplugged. Took the car in today and this was indeed the issue and thankfully a quick fix. 

What confuses me is why the car passes the ‘startup’ self-check (safety lights appear then disappear when built in checks pass) if it can’t communicate with several sensors. It would be useful to know if something happens to those sensors or the connection without having to guess based on what features work or don’t. In my case (and many others recently based on TMC forums) this would have saved a lot of time for Tesla Inc and buyers spent diagnosing, coming in for service, etc. for something forgotten during manufacturing. Lean engineering, fast feedback, etc. 

Also, I can’t for the life of me find an official email, form, etc. on the Tesla site to make suggestions. Something else they could improve.

post,d48wyg,,Is Kia Telluride's driving assist system as good as Tesla's Autopilot? It's actually pretty close. Here’s an in depth review from a Tesla owner.,"DRIVING ASSIST

I recently got a chance to drive a Kia Telluride ""S"" for a day and spent a fair bit of that time testing out the driving assist system in it, which is likely to function the same in its Hyundai counterpart, the Palisade.

Coming from owning a Tesla Model S with Autopilot 2 hardware, I've been interested in the Telluride/Palisade's driving assist system since early reviews. After seeing the Straight Pipe's review of the Telluride (https://youtu.be/v8bqw7qjwus), calling it the ""best lane keep of any car they've driven this year"", I knew I had to find out if a rarely talked about feature in Kia's new flagship vehicle could really meet or beat the gold standard for driving assist; Tesla's autopilot.

The two features I'm specifically interested in are the ""Lane Following Assist (LFA)"" and the ""Smart Cruise Control w/ Stop and Go (SCC)"". The first applies to the steering by keeping you centered in the lane, the second handling the acceleration and braking. Plenty of cars I've driven have good adaptive cruise control systems, and barely noticeable lane keeping systems, but few have come close to the magic of Tesla's autopilot in keeping you a safe distance from cars and objects, and centered in the lane.

THE SYSTEM IN USE

After enabling Kia's ""Lane Following Assist"" in the driver's settings menu from the steering wheel, it will only reveal itself on the dashboard once the adaptive cruise control has been turned on and set. A little steering wheel icon will show up colored white to the right of the adaptive cruise icon in the dashboard. It seems that the ""Lane Following Assist"" will be available and activate on just about any road with good lane lines. This is one of Tesla's Autopilot's best features, as you're not limited to preordained highways like in Cadillac's Supercruise. It was available and active for me most of the time I was using the adaptive cruise control.",11328,True,1568485330.0,2019-09-14 20:22:10,71,21,humanwire,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/d48wyg/is_kia_tellurides_driving_assist_system_as_good/,True,0.83,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,d62t6w,,Why I'm bullish on tesla off the top of my head,"I know on paper tesla looks terrifying but the vast majority of drivers drive I.C.E. cars (internal combustion engine, another word for gasoline vehicles). Currently in 2019 I think only less than 2% of cars on the road are electric, this means there is A LOT of room for growth. On top of this Tesla already produces the best of the best electric vehicles and old car manufactures are unable to compete. Tesla is decades ahead on technology compared to the rest of the world when it comes to electric vehicles. It quite funny, other car companies are releasing electric vehicles in 2019 that don't even beat Teslas very first car that came out in 2012! I'm very bullish on this case alone but tesla has so many other avenues for growth it's truly mind boggling. I'll quickly summarize the other growth factor and can go in more detail if you're interested.

1. Self driving vehicles, tesla is working on self driving vehicles which could allow them to have their own ""uber"" company in the future. Once again, tesla is wayyyyy ahead on the competition when it come to self driving. (They also plan on selling self driving semi trucks within the next few years and Elon estimates that car will be 100% self drivable in less than 5 years. (I'm really excited for this because self driving cars are a lot safer than human driven cars, and less traffic because self driving cars are also statically proven to be much more efficient!

2. Self driving cars leads me to my second point, tesla insurance. Elon has his own insurance for Teslas because Teslas are statistically way safer cars (and will become safer as self driving is implemented) I don't know much about insurance tbh but I know Warren buffet got rich off of buying an insurance company and Elon has his own the far exceeds what other companies offer (only for Teslas which is kinda creating its own ecosystem, same with their tesla ""uber"" service

post,d7i02d,,Anyone else excited for the Model S Plaid?,"Without starting another blatant Porsche VS. Tesla pissing contest, is anyone else excited that Tesla is attempting something like the Model S Plaid? 

I'm a current Model 3 AWD owner, and before that was a C7 Grand Sport owner. I like sporty high performance vehicles but the driving characteristics and convenience of an EV are really hard to pass up. Since getting my Model 3 AWD, I've been very happy but have also been yearning for something with a bit more performance to it. 

I was cautiously optimistic about the Taycan as it seemed to offer a more sporty alternative to Tesla's EV offerings, but the super high starting price tag, lack of self driving functionality, and comparatively limited range made it less of an option for me. Especially considering that you could get a Model 3 performance and a C8 combined for less money.

Though there's a lot of debate about how legitimate the Model S Plaid's times are, I think it's really exciting to see some straight up competition like this. Likewise, even if the Model S Plaid only matches the Taycan's performance on the track it is still going to be cheaper, have better range, have autopilot, and a more established charging infrastructure to go off of. 

What's really compelling to me is that the Model S Plaid really could be the first car that could legitimately nail great track performance with unparalleled day to day convenience, and though it will still be expensive, it will be at a more obtainable price point comparatively speaking. 

I just think the fact that we're coming out with cars that look to be so capable is something to really get excited about.",1632,False,1569107199.0,2019-09-22 01:06:39,2,25,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/d7i02d/anyone_else_excited_for_the_model_s_plaid/,True,0.51,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,das2jn,,Tesla Model 3 AWD vs C7 Grand Sport Road Trip Review,"  

I recently took a trip from Los Angeles up to San Francisco in my Tesla Model 3 AWD. It was my first time road tripping in an electric vehicle and I did a similar trip in my old C7 Corvette Grand Sport so I figured it would be worth sharing my experiences. 

**Routes:** 

My trip in the Model 3 was straight up I-5 from Los Angeles to San Francisco. 

On the C7 I took a more scenic PCH/101 route up to San Francisco and then took the I-5 home. 

Though not exactly an apples to apples comparison on the way up, I think each route played to the car’s strengths. 

The C7 route was made more for of an enjoyable/scenic driving experience, whereas the Model 3 route was made to be very safe with Tesla supercharger infrastructure in mind. 

**Driving Experience:** 

**C7:** To be honest my road trip experience in the C7 left a little to be desired. On the way up I picked a fairly enjoyable route along the California coast with enough beautiful views to make for a memorable experience, and with enough fun road for the car to stretch its legs. Here’s what I ran into. 

**-It was a little harsh.** Though my car did have magnetic ride shocks and we traveled primarily in “tour” mode the C7 did beat me up after a little while. For reference I’m a 27 year old so it’s not like this is some old guy complaining who’s expecting Cadillac ride quality in his track-focused sports car. This also isn’t to say that the car is too stiff to be enjoyable on road trips…it’s just that the sporty setup does wear on you after a few hours. 

**-The car was a little hard to enjoy in the spirited sections of the trip.** This isn’t to say that the C7 handled bad, wasn’t fast in delivering power, etc. It’s just that the C7 Grand Sports’ limits are so high that street legal and street safe speeds don’t really excite it. So driving some of the spirited sections on this trip was a bit of let down because it felt like I was only using a fraction of the car’s potential.",15390,True,1569741944.0,2019-09-29 09:25:44,31,38,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/das2jn/tesla_model_3_awd_vs_c7_grand_sport_road_trip/,True,0.69,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Updated Oct. 23, 2019 8:07 pm ET

Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.35% posted a surprise profit for the third quarter, easing investor fears that the electric car maker’s pursuit of growth and record production figures would come at the expense of the bottom line.

The electric-car maker said Wednesday that it would continue to be profitable, but cautioned that new products could affect the company’s margins.

Tesla’s shares climbed 20% in after-hours trading.

The company said trial production of its compact Model 3 car has started at a new facility in China, and production on its new Model Y compact sport-utility vehicle is ahead of schedule, with a launch set for next summer. The China facility is another sign of Tesla’s ambition to become a global force in car production.

Tesla posted earnings of 78 cents a share for the three months ended Sept. 30, upending analysts’ predictions for a loss of 46 cents a share. For the year-earlier quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.75 a share.

A record delivery figure helped lift Tesla’s bottom line, as customers largely flocked to the lower-price Model 3.

But even as Tesla ramps up Model 3 production, sales of its premium cars have declined.

Third-quarter revenue fell to $6.3 billion from $6.82 billion a year earlier, as deliveries of the Model S and Model X vehicles dropped 37%.

Analysts polled by FactSet had predicted revenue of $6.43 billion.

The company said it is on track to deliver more than 360,000 vehicles in 2019, the lower end of its targeted range of 360,000 to 400,000.

Tesla has had back-to-back quarters of record vehicle deliveries this year after failing to meet estimates earlier in 2019. The company needs to deliver at least 104,800 vehicles in the three months through Dec. 31 to meet the lower end of the projected range.",4761,True,1571878282.0,2019-10-24 02:51:22,5,2,beck2047,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/dm8uit/tesla_delivers_a_surprising_profit/,True,0.64,2019,both,search,False,False,0,

Serious stuff is happening in Shanghai, the site of Tesla’s second manufacturing facility, company executives said on a phone call with investors. The carmaker’s “low-cost” Model 3 vehicles are already moving through assembly lines on a trial basis, and Musk heralded the “massive” stamping machines and in-operation paint shop. He also confirmed media reports that a second building is under construction in the Shanghai complex to handle battery and module production. Tesla hopes to produce 1,000 Model 3s a week from the factory by the end of the year. It will also produce Model Ys, its affordable crossover model, at the plant.

In its earning report, Tesla said it is working to finalise its local manufacturing license and to meet “other governmental requirements” before ramping up production in Shanghai.

That’s good news for Tesla, because China is vital to the carmaker’s future. Though the country’s economy has been buffeted by a trade war with the US, it still has among the most electric-vehicle-friendly regulations on the globe. Chinese car buyers shelled out for one million electric vehicles in 2018, and should buy two million next year, according to a report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

post,dqpewh,,9 Clever Solutions if the .com Domain Name of Your Brand is Taken,"After countless hours refining your brand story, brainstorming names and designing your marketing materials you have finally come up with a stellar brand name for your business. You complete all the official paperwork to register your business under this name. Finally, you go to the registrar of your choice to register the .com domain name that matches your brand name. To your shock and horror you find that it has already been registered. You are not alone, this happens to countless new businesses every day. You can’t go back in time. So what do you do?

1. Try to buy it

This one seems so obvious, however, many people just give up when they find that the domain name is registered. Type the domain name into your browser and see what it resolves to. If you get a landing page indicating that the name is for sale then contact the owner to see if you can acquire it. If the page is parked at a registrar or the domain does not resolve to a website then use [Whois](https://www.whois.com/) or [ICANN Lookup](https://lookup.icann.org/) to find out who the registrant is and contact them.

The above is actually a good situation to be in because at least it means that the domain name is available. If there is a business using the domain then it can be extremely difficult and even impossible at times to acquire it. Many business owners say “we will buy the domain later when we become a big company and can afford it”. Even if you’re a unicorn and can afford it, the business might still not want to sell it to you due to the value that it provides to them. What do you think is happening with [Cruise Automation](https://getcruise.com/) which was [acquired by General Motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_Automation) and [Cruise.com](https://www.cruise.com/). There are numerous other cases exactly like this one. Would you sell a domain name that your entire business depends on?

2. Rebrand

All your marketing materials contain this name. All your customers know you by this name.",8364,True,1572724312.0,2019-11-02 20:51:52,0,3,DotEvoke,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/dqpewh/9_clever_solutions_if_the_com_domain_name_of_your/,True,0.38,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,dxo5ww,,Racial bias in Investing? Just look at the data.,"“But I’m not a racist” 

is a constant refrain in Silicon Valley — a place where 91% of venture capitalists are men, 98% are white or Asian, and almost 90% of their funding goes to white-male led ventures.

It seems like if you buy the pint of vanilla ice cream over the chocolate pint 98 out of 100 times you walk into the grocery store, you might have some ingrained preference for vanilla, no? Maybe you think you have open taste buds, but if vanilla is on the front of the shelf, and it’s a brand you recognize, it’s just the easiest thing to pick up and move on with your day. You’re not looking to see if something else might be available, and equally or more delicious, hiding in plain sight. You’re moving on autopilot, and thus eating a lot of vanilla, whether or not it’s good for you. And that’s what’s most tragic about the status quo – it not only hurts those who aren’t getting chosen, but also the person doing the choosing. 

Venture capitalists, and the asset owners and managers who fund them, pride themselves on being open-minded when it comes to allocating capital: “I don’t care if they are black, blue or have purple spots, as long as they are great managers who can make money.” They view themselves as fully available to new flavors, spotting trends before others do in order to capture the best returns in a competitive market. 

But they are forgetting about the notion of unconscious bias, the ingrained habits we get from society that are extra difficult to root out. Like breathing while sleeping, they happen so naturally we don’t even acknowledge their existence. We only see the outcome — that we don’t die in our sleep (if we are lucky), and we wind up with portfolios of predominantly white fund managers and entrepreneurs. 

This not only means that we as capital allocators perpetuate the vast racial and socioeconomic inequality of our society, but also that we are missing out on massive sources of innovation in a majority-minority country.",13632,True,1574006060.0,2019-11-17 16:54:20,0,9,hugebiggiant,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/dxo5ww/racial_bias_in_investing_just_look_at_the_data/,True,0.1,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,e0o0gm,,Has your view on the Telsa truck changed since the reveal?,"When I watched the Cybertruck reveal I was in shock.  I thought it was so ugly. When the ""unbreakable"" windows broke the whole event seemed like a complete disaster.  Someone made the joke of ""what if John Delorean designed the El Camino"" and I laughed my ass off thinking that was dead on.

But a day or so later, after watching several in-depth youtuber videos of the truck from the test rides, seeing the interior and how massive and spacious the whole thing is, seeing the 16 inch ground clearance (this thing is NO El Camino), looking at the specs, utility features and price I have completely done a 180.  I have decided it's going to be my next vehicle and almost can't wait to get one.  

I'm curious to see what your thoughts are.  What was your initial impression of the Telsa Cybertruck and has that changed as you've taken a closer look?

In the biggest-ever takeover in the luxury-goods industry, lvmh, a French global conglomerate, announced its acquisition of **Tiffany**, an American jeweller founded in 1837 and known for its flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York. lvmh is paying $16.9bn, more than the roughly $14.5bn that was suggested when the transaction was first mooted in late October. The deal represents a success for Bernard Arnault, lvmh’s boss and controlling shareholder, who had courted Tiffany for some time. See [article](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/11/30/lvmh-tests-the-limits-of-luxury).

## The magic trick

The flotation of **Alibaba’s** shares on the Hong Kong stockmarket raised $11.2bn, making it the most valuable share offering this year, ahead of the $8.1bn that Uber raked in at its ipo in May. The stock rose by 6.6% on the first day of trading in what is a secondary listing in Alibaba. Its shares are also listed in New York. See [article](https://www.economist.com/node/21775688).

**Uber** lost its licence to operate in London, again. The ride-hailing company has 45,000 drivers in the city, one of its biggest markets. London’s transport regulator raised more concerns about safety, including 14,000 fraudulent trips by unauthorised drivers.

post,ea513r,,Twelve Days of Pre-Recession GM Christmas: Saturn's Red Line,"**What do you mean 'Pre-Recession'?**

After the year 2000, but before the economic recession of 2008, GM was making some weird cars. Retro styled cars, cars with high performance trims (for seemingly no reason), cars with LS motors mounted sideways, and of course, Saabs.

Why these cars came about is complex. If somebody is willing to offer a theory, I'm all ears. However, I'm not here to explore the roots of this issue, only what fruit it ended up bearing. While many of these cars may have continued production after the recession of 2008-2010, most if not all were born of the white heat of stupidity that lost GM $82 billion before this time. I say stupidity of course, because most of the following vehicles I would like to own one day.

**Saturn's 'Red Line'**

[Saturn](https://i.redd.it/0aqpdkbm8of11.jpg) lived fast and died young, having only made cars for twenty years. Set up to compete with the flood of small, superior Japanese cars entering the U.S. market, they made small, inferior American cars. A few of these vehicles managed to claw their way out of obscurity via forced induction, or because they made you think, ""Why?"".

""Red Line"" was like Saturn's BMW 'M'. Knowing what Saturn was, you can kind of string together what that really meant. It's like a joke where the setup and the punchline are the same.

""Saturn says they're making their own version of BMW's 'M' division. Critics say they're expecting it to be like if Saturn made their own version of BMW's 'M' division.""

The vehicles that received the Red Line trim were the Ion, Sky, and Vue. I'll start with the Ion.

The Saturn Ion ""coupe"" is a strange car to begin with, just as Saturn was a strange brand. Similar to the Mazda RX-8, it has an extra set of miniature doors to accommodate the rear passengers. GM called this a, [""quad coupe""](https://archive.fortune.com/assets/i2.cdn.turner.com/money/galleries/2011/autos/1110/gallery.three_door_cars.fortune/images/2004_saturn_ion_quadcoupe_2.",9154,True,1576249229.0,2019-12-13 16:00:29,743,130,Aelmay,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/ea513r/twelve_days_of_prerecession_gm_christmas_saturns/,True,0.98,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Veteran executives and financiers helped fuel WeWork’s spectacular rise and fall, pouring in capital while ceding control to its founder

By Maureen Farrell and Eliot Brown
Dec. 14, 2019 12:00 am ET
 
In early October, WeWork’s board of directors trickled into a brick building in lower Manhattan where the startup had an office. After they took their seats around the conference room table, Mark Schwartz started to vent.

“I’ve stayed silent too long,” the 65-year-old former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner told the six other men on the board, including WeWork’s co-founder and chairman, Adam Neumann.

Mr. Schwartz aired his frustrations about the state of the company, which was perilously low on cash after years of freewheeling spending and had become the butt of jokes on Wall Street, according to people familiar with the meeting.

No more fantasies, he said, as advisers and others looked on. Now, he said, they needed to make decisions that would save the company.

Even more remarkable than the content of Mr. Schwartz’s blistering rebuke was the fact that it came so late. The banker had stayed silent so long that the story was almost over.

We Co., as the parent company is officially known, was already a distressed asset by then, undone by conflicts and the dawning realization that it was just a hip real-estate sublessor—not a tech company. A few weeks earlier, WeWork had shelved its disastrous attempt at an initial public offering and Mr. Neumann had subsequently stepped down as chief executive.

It was a spectacular fall for the company that months before had been America’s most valuable startup.

Little of WeWork’s trajectory would have been possible were it not for the collection of veteran executives and financiers from the upper echelons of Wall Street and Silicon Valley who enabled Mr.",34647,True,1576340063.0,2019-12-14 17:14:23,48,4,TheDitkaDog,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/ealke8/wsj_weekend_the_money_men_who_enabled_adam/,True,0.9,2019,elon,search,False,False,0,

post,eb8y2i,,So many people keep asking me: How will Maxwell DBE technology help Tesla?,"Well, here is the answer:

1. Panasonic has X square feet of space in GF1. And has the maximum capacity to produce 35 GWH of battery cells in a year, with the current technology.

2. Maxwell DBE technology doesn't change the chemistry of cells produced. It only changes the process how the material is applied to the cathode.

3. Put simply, presently, Panasonic dissolves the material in a solvent, applies it to cathode, then dries the cathode, treats the residual solvent.

4. Maxwell DBE process makes a kind of paste of material to be applied on cathode. Applies it on cathode. And dries it up (faster, as paste dries up faster than a liquid). No need to treat any residual solvent (as there is none). So the whole process of manufacturing the cathode takes 1/16th of time & 1/2 of space. So in the area presently occupied by Panasonic, with the appropriate equipment, Tesla can produce 35x16x2 GWH of cells in a year. That is roughly 1 Terra Watt Hours (1TWH) of cells in a year.

5. Additional advantage of DBE technology is that 20% more material can be applied to each cathode in the dry process. So it increases the capacity by 20%.

6. Since the DBE technology process is simpler, cost to produce each cell is 10-20% less.

7. So, in future, Gigafactories may be renamed as Terra factories.

8. This will help Tesla produce more cells for stationary storage (mega packs etc) as well as for vehicles (Model Y, Semi, Roadster 2.0, Cybrtrk etc), without needing to build more Gigafactories in the near future, in USA.",1525,False,1576464209.0,2019-12-16 03:43:29,7,8,vinodjetley,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/eb8y2i/so_many_people_keep_asking_me_how_will_maxwell/,True,0.82,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

1) How does Tesla manage charging in homes with PV panels and Tesla batteries? Are they providing DC straight from the PV/battery combo or is electricity being converted to AC before being delivered to the car so that it can be converted again?

2) AFAIK, the only available domestic DC charging solutions for EV’s are based on CHadeMO, which actually feature V2G capabilities, but these are not widely available yet and virtually all domestic solutions are AC. I believe that the type 2 plug has some sort of limited DC capability even without the extra CCS pins but I have not been able to find any info for type 1 plugs.

2) I need to have payment on delivery. I'm not financing, so I presume that is a cashier's check? Does it matter who it is made out to? (e.g. ""Tesla"" or ""Tesla Motors"" or ""Tesla Motors Inc"") Can I assume that the price in my account is the correct final price (see # 4 below)?

3) I got an email asking which dates I couldn't take delivery. I gave them as many dates as I could, including this Sunday. If they contacted me and wanted to deliver this Sunday, the I would have to go get a cashier's check today (as the bank will be closed over the weekend). How far ahead will I hear about delivery?

4) I have a trade-in. I was quoted a price for the trade-in, but they didn't ask anything about the car. Can I assume they will still honor this price if the trade-in doesn't run (which is why I'm buying a new car!). How will they pick up the trade in?

5) My wife is listed on the title of the trade-in. She leaves town on the 27th. What happens then?

post,efivfm,,Tesla v World on Autonomy,"Disclaimer: I own TSLA, work at Tesla (not on autonomy), and this is purely my opinion. Everything I talk about is public info.

-Background-

Basically every company doing autonomy is using lidar and simulated driving with a small amount of real world miles with their own vehicles. Tesla does not use lidar and has 100x  the amount of real world data than everyone else combined because of its massive fleet.

-Lidar

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucp0TTmvqOE&t=2h16m48s

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucp0TTmvqOE&t=2h33m33s


-Real world data

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucp0TTmvqOE&t=2h02m45s

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucp0TTmvqOE&t=2h04m40s


-Levels of autonomy

https://www.truecar.com/blog/5-levels-autonomous-vehicles/



Heres my thoughts on autonomy from Tesla's perspective

1. Best case: Maybe lidar is first to l4 but Tesla gets to l5 first.
-The moat is disgustingly large. If tesla wins autonomy how does anyone catch up? All the data from billions of fleet miles and millions of robotaxis already on the road. Cheaper due to customers putting in the capital, no lidar costs, and infrastructure taken care of (park in customer garages and customer charges maintains etc.). 

2. Middle case: Lidar gets to l5 first but Tesla follows a few years later. 
-Once Tesla gets there they will be far cheaper and eat Uber, Lyft, Waymo, and whatever other burgeoning autonomy companies exist, not to mention other automakers.

3. Worst case: Lidar gets to l5, Tesla never gets there and has to install lidar on the fleet and replan their autonomy division, whether because Elon admits his hubris or by lawsuits pouring in from customers who purchased FSD. Depending on how easy it is to do autonomy from this point, Tesla either never gets there or takes a much longer time but still ends up with a cheaper service. Tesla takes a bite out of the autonomy companies but they are so far ahead its insignificant.",2669,True,1577293612.0,2019-12-25 18:06:52,82,120,stackpack,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/efivfm/tesla_v_world_on_autonomy/,True,0.86,2019,both,search,False,False,0,

* What work is done. Do they just put in a new roof, or do they redo the framing, etc. to support the added load?
* How much flexibility do we have? I don't like my roof, and have been considering e.g. adding dormers or lofting the roof. Are those the sorts of things it supports?
* What's the quality of the workmanship? They used to have a forever warranty, and now it's 30 years. Does it look like it will last that long without problems?
* How long it takes.
* Generally, what experiences have been like.

I'm also a bit confused about how to talk to Tesla. My local roofer can chat with me for an hour. Is the way to get Tesla to talk to me to place an order with a refundable deposit?

Googling, I see a lot of blog posts talking ABOUT the product based on press releases, but I've found a disappointingly small number which are by people who've had them installed themselves. Of those, very few go into the level of detail I might hope for when considering a product.

post,ehlq1t,,Why I think Subaru doesn’t change the STI,"I was reading [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/ehfcif/name_one_underrated_car_and_one_overrated_car_but/fciy65e/), and something clicked. It has to do with the discussion post the other day (yesterday?) about Dodge knowing their target/printing money with their geriatric lineup. 

The STI doesn’t really cost Subaru as much if it stays the same. 

It’s an enthusiast car. Soccer moms in Missouri aren’t buying STIs. So to begin with, it is a small market of car enthusiasts that the car even is applicable to. It’s also only a manual-transmissioned car, so that narrows it even further. Further still, it’s car enthusiasts that LIKE what it is. There is a much larger slice of car enthusiasts that want a two-door, RWD car with a large V8. 

Back when it had the Lancer Evolution to battle with, it made news. It was on magazine covers. It was at the forefront due to the competition, and on the larger radar of the automotive world. But when Mitsubishi axed the Evo, the STI is facing a conundrum: with nothing to beat (sorry, Golf R) why innovate? Additionally, with no reason to innovate, why not cancel it as well?

Subaru is a very interesting car company. Mazda (and time an extent, Tesla) is similar in this regard - as a smaller manufacturer you need to give customers what they want. You can’t cancel your entire passenger car line like Ford because:fuck you, customers.  So, Subaru is keenly aware that the small, but vocal (and die-hard) enthusiasts for the STI deserve to have it remain in production. 

To do that, they need to cost-save as much as possible. EJ25 still work OK? Good. Body style still mostly liked by people? OK? Good. Can we get away with another year without a giant iPad dashboard? OK? Good. Let’s throw some different wheels on for 2020.

This keeps the STI in production, still giving fans and enthusiasts a car, versus another cancelled icon.",2042,True,1577710538.0,2019-12-30 13:55:38,179,265,LogicWavelength,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/ehlq1t/why_i_think_subaru_doesnt_change_the_sti/,True,0.87,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

- Increase production while reducing costs (Surprise Q3 profit - cost reduction was not 'Priced In')

- Go Global (Gigafactory Shanghai built in 10 months - 2 more months to 1000 cars/week rate with 1 6 day - 10 hour shifts)

- Give accurate Forecasts - needed to judge growth companies (Nailed it - predicted Deliveries 2 Quarters out)

And the real money on Wall Street seems to be in agreement - TSLA - $454/share Intraday High - All Time High

Beyond this it is anyones call, but I strongly believe Tesla's unique mission will allow it to expand into the entrenched Global Automobile Market as possibly an OEM for EV subsystems; drivetrain, batteries, Integration Platforms, Recharging Network, Patent Sharing, Autonomy Platform. With a negotiated profit margin on all inequitable partnership, say, 10-30% or more. 

Tesla behaves differently because it wants more than to return shareholder value, but to transition everyone to clean transport.  Lets see if Tesla's leadership in EVs pays off in ways that benefit everyone in the long term.

post,emyypl,,A New Year a New Car! Here's my 2020 Stinger GT Limited,"Most people get the practical car first then the weekend car, I did the opposite and after two years of no vehicle to drive during Canadian winter it was time to get another car.


My only requirements were that it have 4 doors and be more practical then the Corvette. With a budget up to 60k CAD that pretty much meant anything and everything under the sun was available. For the first few weeks I couldn't make up my mind, I considered sports sedans like the Stinger, G70 and the CTS/ATS-V. I considered things like the Civic, Golf, WRX and Focus all the up to their top performance versions. I even considered a new RAM 1500, ZR2 and a used Hellcat/392.


After many weeks I came to the conclusion I wanted something that was still fun but practical and AWD was heavily preffered. So that eliminated any ideas of driving a V8 charger, Hellcat or otherwise as well as the trucks.


I looked at the Golf R, STI, RS and Type R but I'm not a fan of hatchbacks and for the price the STI felt like a terrible deal.


This left the Stinger and the G70. God this was tough. First the value proposition of a Stinger in Canada is insanity. It costs top spec the same as a US Stinger, normally similar vehicles in Canada are around 13% more expensive in Canada vs the US. This played heavily into it, 52k for a loaded Stinger, 365hp, AWD and tech through the roof is ridiculous when you consider that the STI stickers for 49k CAD. Just no contest here.


I took a trip over to my local Kia dealer, they didn't have a GT, just the 4 cylinder so I took that for a spin and liked it a lot. The car overall should be similar to the GT so if I liked the 4 cylinder odds are I'd love the GT.


Next came the G70. Genesis does things differently in Canada. There is no dealer, they ship a car right to you. I scheduled a test drive, my ideal combo would be the top 3.3 trim with red stitching and Mallorca Blue. They didn't have it available but I got to drive the 3.3 regardless.",5337,True,1578698136.0,2020-01-11 00:15:36,126,73,The_Exia,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/emyypl/a_new_year_a_new_car_heres_my_2020_stinger_gt/,True,0.9,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,eocmz1,,Why is the long Tailpipe Argument not compared between combustion vehicles and EV's?,"So I'm a car person, and a lot of things with cars fascinate me, and in my lifetime one of the most fascinating developments has been the rise of electric vehicles.

I would like to add a note that I'm not in one camp or the other, as to me in a lot of aspects a car is a car, I'm more interested in the ""cool"" facets of technology and the ""cool"" things that certain cars have.

And I'm certainly not the type of person to bang my chest and say that every gas-guzzling vehicle needs to come off the road, because let's face it there is nothing more wonderful than the sound of a big V8, or the absolute scream as a rotary goes past you. Those cars have their own type of cool factor.

Plus the way I see it, is that if the people that don't need to have a combustion car, don't actually have a combustion car, then that means there's more fuel for the rest of us that have a passion with combustion engines.

Now one argument that I constantly see with electric vehicles, is what is known as the ""Long Tailpipe Argument""

Namely this means that during an electric vehicles life cycle, you don't factor in just the emissions the electric vehicle produces, but also the emissions produced in the mining of the raw materials, the production of the raw materials into workable materials, the production of the energy, the production of the infrastructure needed to carry that energy to the vehicle, and the end of life impact of the vehicle once it is no longer suitable for use on the road.

However I've never seen this same comparison done for a conventional combustion powered vehicle.

Now maybe I've been looking in the wrong places, but aside from the batteries, a conventional car would have the same mining and processing upkeep as an electric vehicle, and the end of life for a regular vehicle with a combustion engine would not be all that different from electric vehicle, especially when you factor in the both types of vehicle are generally recycled into their constituent components.",3625,True,1578959170.0,2020-01-14 00:46:10,27,44,Rumbuck_274,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/eocmz1/why_is_the_long_tailpipe_argument_not_compared/,True,0.72,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Edit:   Let’s also not forget about all the after market floor mats and pedal covers.

Edit2:  I see a lot of post saying let’s wait for the investigation.   To be clear NHSTA is still looking into the claims to see IF an investigation is even needed into Tesla.  You wouldn’t know it from the headlines.  Headlines like 500k Tesla may be recalled do not print that same picture. The fact that the claims were brought to NHSTA  and were spewed to the public by a short seller is questionable.

I would also like to remind people that Tesla has already proven its track record with safety and adding features to save people from themselves.   If they saw issues they would have already added features or made changes.

What happened when a kid took his dads car and crashed at 127mph?  Tesla released a speed limit mode.   What happened when a 4 year old pinned his mom against the garage wall?  They added pin to drive.

post,er6lkh,,Environmental protests in Germany over planned Tesla car plant,"On Saturday, January 18, around 250 German protesters spoke out in Berlin against American car manufacturer Tesla’s plans to build a Tesla Gigafactory, claiming that the construction of the plant will consume enormous amounts of water and endanger surrounding wildlife. 

The US automotive and energy company had announced plans in November to construct its first European car factory in Gruenheide near the Berlin Brandenburg International Airport located southeast of Berlin.

post,etsfa4,,Gigafactory 1 development not on part with capacity needed,"As seen on [satellite pictures of the Gigafactory 1](https://www.buildingtesla.com/compare/Gigafactory%201/10-08-2017/18-01-2020/) in Reno, Nevada, there has been no exterior expansion since around August 2017 (only part of the roof has been equipped with solar panels during this time). The original goal for the factory was for it to be completed in 2020, but as of this moment the factory is still only about 30% completed. In 2017 Elon announced the development schedule would change as they found a way to use the space more effectively. A new year of completion was not announced, so it was still expected to be finished this year.

In my eyes there would be no reason for Tesla to not complete or at least expand Gigafactory 1. Tesla announced the Semi, Roadster and Model Y with original start of production/release date of respectively 2019(!), 2020 and fall 2020 (not looking at the Cybertruck as it is 2 years out). All these announcements were made after Tesla finished building [part F+ of the Gigafactory](https://cleantechnica.com/files/2019/01/Building-completion-V3.png). With the Fremont factory bursting at its seams, needing the famous tent as an extra line for Model 3 final assembly and them cramming in a production line for the Model Y, there would be no way production lines of the Semi and Roadster would fit. And I don't expect them to fit in the unfinished Gigafactory 1 either, as I reckon they have been fitting that factory to the brim with all the battery and powertrain production for the Model 3 and Y. So where are they making the Semi and Roadster? Model Y's have been spotted a lot the past few weeks, but no sightings of new Semi trucks or Roadsters while these all should be ready within single digit months. Also, Elon has said on multiple occasions that the Model Y would probably sell more than the S, 3 and X together, but how would they produce these if there already wasn't enough room to produce Model 3's last year?",3682,True,1579967834.0,2020-01-25 16:57:14,34,57,_-q-w-e-r-t-y-_,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/etsfa4/gigafactory_1_development_not_on_part_with/,True,0.69,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

post,ey1kga,,Acceleration Boost Upgrade and Refund Experience,"**Update**
Refund posted to my card within 12 hours of making the request in app. Only regret is not buying $2k of TSLA on Friday instead of the boost :)

I decided to buy the AWD boost on Friday night and give it a go for the weekend. Seems there are a lot of questions floating around as to how the process works, so I thought I'd share my experience.

TL;DR Do it if you want to try it. Seems like Tesla thought this through and put in the work to automate as much as possible in order to minimize contact rates. Screenshots [here](https://imgur.com/a/a1ywUKC).

**Purchase**

Friday night, I purchased it in app using Apple Pay. Modal in-app says I have 48 hours to request refund. Apple Card was charged immediately, and the transaction cleared the following day. *Side note: I have no idea how anyone butt purchases this. I tapped Purchase, which loaded another webkit view where I had to tap Purchase again, and then I had to auth with Face ID.*

After purchase, the boost shows up in the purchased tab of the upgrades page, and there are links to view my invoice and request a refund. I go into my garage, and sport mode is on my car. Of course I go for a drive.

**Experience**

<48h time lapse>Lots of driving and smiles on my face. Boost is significant after about 35mph but very minimal from a stop. Would like to see same level of violence from 0mph as I did from 35+. Picked up a buddy with a non-boosted AWD and took him for a ride. He wasn't impressed from a dig, but he laughed like a girl from a roll.</48h time lapse>

**Refund**

Tonight I got home from a Super Bowl party (go Chiefs) and requested the refund. There are three options along with a comments box. I filled it out and had to double confirm to request the refund. The confirmation notification said I will receive a refund within 3-5 business days, and within minutes the boost was removed from my car (drive modes back to standard and chill). So far no activity on my Apple Card.",2272,True,1580704969.0,2020-02-03 05:42:49,132,76,an_urban_cowboy,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ey1kga/acceleration_boost_upgrade_and_refund_experience/,True,0.9,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,f1dlqh,,Autopilot rewrite with 3d labeling is only starting to use FSD computer’s potential,"Elon Musk revealed a [foundational Autopilot rewrite](https://youtu.be/_a6lF2Ss3G4?t=81) to combine planning, perception and image recognition trained on 3d-labeled data, and this departs from primarily focusing on individually-labeled main camera frames that has worked great for highway Autopilot optimized for HW2. This is likely to address the remaining concerns back in October from [2019 Q3 earning call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/24/tesla-inc-tsla-q3-2019-earnings-call-transcript.aspx): “Now we need to work on solving the intermediate portion which is traffic lights and stop signs, and navigating through … windy narrow roads in suburban neighborhoods.”

Notably windy roads are difficult because the lane edges can leave the view of the main camera, and similarly traffic lights and stop signs can be hard to see from the stop line when using only the main camera. Here’s a screenshot from a [greentheonly video](https://youtu.be/OdKA5Y7nXMY?t=25) where Fisheye camera has enough vision to predict the yellow lines while Main camera barely sees the right edge of the destination lane and fails to make a lane prediction.

Also from greentheonly videos, you can count the frames between neural network updates where Main camera updates every frame while all other cameras update every 4th frame. This sampling is likely limited by Autopilot optimized for HW2 to handle 99 total frames per second using up \~90% of the compute budget. But with FSD computer having 21 times the capacity, this sampled frame rate is only \~5% of the budget, and going to full 36 frame per second from 8 cameras would increase to \~14% of compute.

post,f5v3ek,,Tesla domestic battery production for EVs and the Westwater Resources (NASDAQ:WWR) source materials underdog,"I think we are familiar with the speculative but generally accepted rumor that Tesla will start producing its own batteries based on their acquisition of Maxwell technologies. 

Lithium Ion batteries have mostly two ingredients in them: lithium and graphite. Neither of those come from domestic sources, with most lithium coming from South America and most graphite coming from China. Westwater Resources (WWR) is a small cap publicly traded corporation that mines both, in addition to uranium which I won't comment on because it is not relevant to Tesla in the near term. WWR retooled a few years ago to do battery products by purchasing a graphite plant and exploring for lithium in what we would all consider in hindsight to be an excellent bet.

WWR owns the only near-term graphite mining site in the USA, and has several exploratory lithium brine sites in the country. Right now their plans are to create a pilot plant and process 20 tons of raw material they purchased in order to satisfy customer testing, and then by 2022 they will have completed their graphite mining and processing infrastructure. The graphite chemistry is incredibly important because that is where the energy is stored when the lithium ions are pulled across the electrolyte. There is also about 3x more graphite in a battery than lithium. 

The supply of graphite in the world is about static, with threats of export controls from China. We certainly don't want to be dependent on them for energy infrastructure. Our best solution is to get the graphite right here. If Elon puts out his battery manufacturing plans as we suspect we can expect there to be a massive demand for the source materials and for them to look for the best accountability path.

Right now the needs we are meeting are whatever Panasonic can put out, plus whatever is going into laptops and smartphones.",3196,True,1582046074.0,2020-02-18 18:14:34,28,24,dgcaste,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/f5v3ek/tesla_domestic_battery_production_for_evs_and_the/,True,0.77,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

post,ftu1oy,,Manifesto (in short some important stuff on the market),"Suggestion:
Dear manufacturers, car owners, carmakers and modders. In this post, I would like to give you an idea, a possible direction of making electric cars more affordable and better.
1* Please for the love of my parents unify the chargers. It's impossible to find a charger to fit your car. You have to carry 10kg of adapters for your car to drive freely. Please standardize the charging points and make them accessible licence free online for us to modify them to make them better (lighter etc.)
2* Better battery cells. Please don't pretend it's the early 2000. Use the latest tech battery cells. I recommend using LiFePo4. They are not that different to popular LiPo but unlike them, they are not flammable, and easier to use. They are nearly 3 times lighter than popular cells. The best representation of that is that Tesla 3 with these batteries would be 350kg lighter. Making it a 1t car.
3* Try using reusable energy sources to better the range. I installed solar panels on my friend's charging station to make it more affordable. It would be great if you installed solar panels on the car roof, boot or even front. They are affordable and bendable. They are already being used on campers and military vehicles so they are easy to buy. In my upcoming project, I`m using turbofan to charge my batteries on motorways (highways). That way the power comes from solar panels on the roof, fans being grill already cooling batteries and regeneration braking. And from battery and motor heat (want to know more ask me in the comments).
4* Make batteries easy to change for example so you can swap mustangs battery with chevy volt. Now when you break a battery you have to order a specific one and wait about a month for the shipment. That would make eco-driving more user friendly and would make companies compete in their cell qualities.
5* Use wheel hub type motors.",6223,True,1585859880.0,2020-04-02 22:38:00,7,13,Automatitiongeek,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/ftu1oy/manifesto_in_short_some_important_stuff_on_the/,True,0.89,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,fvj7or,,Someone on Quora made a really good point on why it’s a good idea to go all-in on Tesla.,"I was 50-50 on QQQ and VTI. However after reading this post I am gonna switch to all-in on Tesla. I think they’re gonna grow as big as Ford, GM and so forth one day. Below is the full post. 

https://www.quora.com/How-does-Tesla-continue-running-and-making-cars-if-they-lose-money-every-year-From-where-do-they-get-the-money-to-continue/answer/Steve-Baker-100?ch=10&share=3dd4d100&srid=uumtx


“You are falling for a common line put up by Tesla-haters and short-sellers.

Tesla does sell cars for more than the cost of making them. Some estimates say 30% more.

For people like you and me - we’d call that a “Profit” and by the standards of the car industry, it’s a very good one…but it’s not strictly profit if you go and spend it all.

Remember: For all the noise that’s made about them, Tesla are a TINY company. Ford and GM each make between 5 and 7 million cars every year. Tesla makes about 300,000 cars per year (2019). They are a tiny fly-speck of a company compared to VW and Toyota - both of which dwarf Ford and GM.

WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE EXCESS MONEY YOU MAKE?

So what should Tesla do with that “profit”? Put it in the bank? Use it as a stock dividend to pay back their investors? Pay back their loans ahead of schedule?

NO!!!

That would be completely, INSANELY, STUPID!!

Tesla, have Model Y owners who ordered a car and will have to wait a year to get it. As of February 2020, they had 550,000 pre-orders (and climbing) for the CyberTruck and they haven’t even chosen the site for the factory they’ll have to build to make it in!!

When you have a HUGE backlog of orders, the only sane way to proceed is to grow the company - and to keep growing it until you can meet the demand for your product.

Therefore, they should take every spare penny they make and every penny they can borrow and use the money to build more factories!!

More factories means more cars can be manufactured - which means MORE money to build MORE factories.",6737,True,1586113390.0,2020-04-05 21:03:10,0,11,Okmanl,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fvj7or/someone_on_quora_made_a_really_good_point_on_why/,True,0.36,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

by the way does anybody remember the stock going up dramatically because they met and exceeded Q4 2019 production results? Maybe daddy Elon knew the shit was hitting the fan and told the quality assurance specialists all to self quarantine months before everyone else in order to boost production flow? 🤷‍♂️ 


-edit-
Got my car back and things do look better. They cut out and installed a new glass roof.   Everything else is within Tesla specifications. Tesla is an adjective in that sentence.

Overall I knew what I was getting myself into. I was just hoping that the quality issues like I saw where a thing of the past. The car itself is every bit as fun as all of the car reviewers say it is, really incredible.

Coming from a car guy my whole life and never driven a Tesla before buying mine, I really have to also say (just like everyone before me) that it is a whole new driving experience.

post,g0502h,,How to choose which stock you should buy first ?,"Hi guys,   


New Stock investor here, I have been thinking about going into the stock market since the big dip of feb 27, but I didn't know anything about stocks, and I am not US citizen so the process was much more complicated for me, now I am ready to go in, I have 9k USD available to invest and 4k more within 3 weeks (I will still have about 20k USD in saving don't worry).   


I know dollar cost average is the way to go and I am planning to do that anyway, but since the market already regained a lot of the loss since the big dip I feel like a lot of the stocks are now overvalued as well, so I am not sure which stock should I start to buy first and which to hold off on, the more I read the more complicated everything seems to get. 

&#x200B;

I want my portfolio to consist of blue chip stocks with a lot of room for growth or with steady and increasing dividends, I am ok with the volatility in the short term but I want big gains long term (I will continue investing after the virus is gone), here is the list of stocks that is on my watch list that I thought match my criteria (most of them increased in double digits since I added them on the list so I am no sure anymore),    


DIS (Disney) (I know that the parks are closed and their Cruz ships are not operating, but I feel like that will quickly be fixed with vaccine/cure)

MSFT (Microsoft) (Pretty safe and have been growing for the past few years)

Qcom (Qualcomm) (it has a lot of ups and downs, but will likely have great revenue from 5G and Autopilot chips). 

V (Visa) (Pretty safe and have been growing for the past few years and I think will gain more internationally when people deal more with credit card instead of dirty cash)

MA (MasterCard) (same as visa)

HD (The Home Depot) (Good dividend, increases often, stock price is usually going up, dominant in its market).

post,g33o28,,Cars all electric in 30 years? The real numbers.,"Hi, just recently I tripped over a YouTuber who claimed that in 30 years petrol cars will be past. Being an electrician, I couldn't help myself and calculate the real odds for that. I'll be 62 at that time and it seems like a good number to go with. So, let's hop in to the numbers and see what we have here. For simplicity, I'll be calculating only the U.S.A. The numbers are actually relatively easy to extract from data.

In 2019 US have used 142.23G gallons or 538.4G liters of gasoline or almost 5PW of chemical power.

1L of gasoline = (roughly) 9kWh worth of power.

Our efficiency number for gasoline car will be only 20% (in favor of EV's).

9,000\*0.2=1800 = only 1.8kWh/L of actually delivered power.

538.4GL\*1.8kW=969.12TW per year or almost 1PW/yr to run cars at 100% efficiency. That's no heaters, lights, autopilot, power steering etc.

Now, let's match it.

One NPP block = 1GWh of power, that is 24GWh/day and 8.76TWh a year.

970T/8.76T=110.73 nuclear power plant blocks needed to match.

Yes, you need to build 111 nuclear power plant blocks just to cover gasoline cars. That's some 1,000,000,000,000$ of private sector investments in nuclear power over next 30 years if not counting inflation, or 46 Elon Musks.

But, this is fun, let's go ""ecological"".

Largest windmill: 10MWh that's 87.6Gwh per year and 11,073 gigantic windmills in NON STOP WIND to meet the demand. Windmills realistically cost 1M$ per 1MW so the largest one will ring at around 10M$, not counting delivery and installation. Full rig to meet demand will then cost  110,730,000,000$ windmills only. Realistically you'll need double that and massive energy storage network to account for weather shifts.

Let's go solar: 1m2 = 300Wh. Let's be generous and give them 12H full sun a day (not even possible), that is 3.6kWh a day and 1.314MWh a year/1m2. You need 738,204,957m2 of panels or 118,112,640,000$ to meet demand. Realistically though you'll need at least double that to actually cover demand.",3843,True,1587135770.0,2020-04-17 17:02:50,0,14,Paegaskiller,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/g33o28/cars_all_electric_in_30_years_the_real_numbers/,True,0.37,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

But yes, I think it is the first time Tesla market cap ever exceeds the sum of 3 German car makers.

Due to the tough situation for the car industry and around world pandemic, but it think it is worthwhile to mention.

post,gadhod,,$TSLA: some stats out of China autos recovering from COVID-19,"Analysts at Needham held an Expert Call on Monday which provided some interesting stats out of China and outlook for the global auto industry recovering from COVID-19.

1. In China, 2020 light vehicle production is projected to decline 5% to 12.5% y/y, according to rating agencies and industry sources. However, the auto market there is recovering, with OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers returning to pre-pandemic levels. By end of March, auto plants in China are operating at 97% capacity vs. 60% in February.
2. On the demand side, country-wide return-to-work appears to be strengthening consumer confidence and demand for vehicles. Adding to that demand are federal + regional stimulus programs for electric vehicles. Multiple Chinese cities have also relaxed restrictions on license plates for EVs (such restrictions have been used as a measure to manage congestion). However, total units are expected to still be below 2019 and 2018.
3. Behavioral wise, Chinese consumers have shifted more towards private vehicles to avoid shared vehicles (benefit to auto demand), but they're also leaving their homes less and have grown more accustomed to delivery (headwind to auto demand).
4. $TSLA has been by far the leader in China's EV market, selling 12k Model 3 alone in March, well ahead of second place BYD (sold 5k EVs), BAIC (4.5k), and BMW 5 Series PHEV and Ford Escape PHEV lagging behind (under 3k). Including both luxury EVs and non-EVs, Tesla was the 2nd best selling in the country after Mercedes C-Class, but the clear leader in Tier 1 cities (Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen). Chinese consumers also have a tendency to discount Chinese brands vs. global brands.
5. Caution against using China as a benchmark for recovery timeline in EU/US. China was able to flatten the curve and recover in 4-6 weeks due to its integrated coding system that identifies every person that needs to be quarantined based on their mobility patterns. Such an invasive surveillance system is not possible in EU/US.",2215,True,1588180899.0,2020-04-29 19:21:39,2,3,street-guru,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/gadhod/tsla_some_stats_out_of_china_autos_recovering/,True,0.75,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Ford, Lincoln, Troller, Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche, Seat, Skoda, Volkswagen, MAN, Scania, Ducati, Alfa Romeo, Dodge, Lancia, Maserati, Chrysler, Fiat, Jeep, Ram, Peugeot, DS Automobiles, Opel, Citroen and Vauxhall.

These are the brands of VW Group, PSA, Ford Motor Company and FIAT Chrysler, together they have over 300 factories worldwide, they have a combined turnover of $650 billion, they employ 879,000 people and they sell nearly 25 million cars per year.

Tesla currently have three factories, their revenue is $24 billion, they employ 48,000 people and they sell 350,000 cars per year.

As things stand today Tesla is valued at $130 billion, the other four companies combined are valued at $121 billion. I believe this proves beyond any doubt that Tesla is vastly overvalued, personally I believe its true value is around $15 billion.

post,genu1a,,Decoding Elon's Success,"So, I wasn't even a huge fan of Elon before I started researching him for a brand new podcast and article series which I'm calling *Success Decoded*.

I've wanted a Tesla badly ever since I watched the Model X unveiling live in 2015, and had a lot of respect for him, but just didn't know much about him except that he was part of Paypal.

I chose Elon to profile first as he is the most interesting, accomplished and visionary person in the world. 

Now, I would *definitely* consider myself a **huge** fan.

So the podcast is completely ad-free, just wanted to focus on pure value.

It's gonna be a 3-parter:

\- Part 1 is out, and it's 30-mins on Elon's early life up to when he sells Zip2 and becomes a multimillionaire. 

\- Part 2 will be about SpaceX, Tesla, and all the industries he's disrupting. 

\- Part 3 will be the analysis of his success and what lessons we can learn.

I've tried to make it as accurate as possible, using the Vance biography plus loads of interviews with him (especially ThirdRow one which was awesome).

I've also tried to make it a relaxing listen. It's the first podcast I've ever produced so any and all feedback welcome!

Up 242% YoY, I can't seem to comprehend what attracts investors and institutions towards this stock, as not much has really changed, fundamentally with this company. I am going to share my view on Tesla and try and debunk each bull theory, from my point of view.  


* Tesla is 5 to 10 years ahead of its competitors

If you had said this to me about 12 months ago, I would've agreed with you, back then, it felt like the moat around Tesla's battery technology and the supercharging network was simply too much for others to catch up in a reasonable time frame. The release of the Porsche Taycan however, changed everything for me. Despite what you may say about the car's price, the Taycan is simply an amazing car and shows that the VW group is just steps behind Tesla in terms of  EV tech. With a real-world range of \~280 miles and a price \~100k to 130k USD with options, it presents itself as a viable option for those who may otherwise be shopping for a Model S. Moreover, it showed that Tesla was simply not great at building cars. The Taycan has a much better chassis and cooling design than the ""compatible"" Model S and Model 3. This extends further to the build quality, where Tesla cars still suffer from large panel gaps and imperfect paint jobs, despite having had 2 years to iron out these production issues. Europe was a hot market for Tesla through 2019, but its dominance will fade with the introduction of EV from big German automakers that are targeting the same segment as Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y (BMW i4 2021, Audi Q4 2021, Mercedes EQA 2021, VW ID series, etc..)

post,gni8vc,,"Online companies threatening my brick-and-mortar store, should I team up with local competitor?","Im selling a product in my brick-and-mortar store that’s almost exclusively sold online. There are a lack of brick-and-mortar stores for this item, and took a chance to see if there would be a demand for in-person vs online. It’s been very successful. Many people like the convenience of being able to receive the item same day instead of waiting a lot longer. There are millions of people in the metropolitan area my store is in, and only two stores that sell this item (my local competitor and I). 

The online companies have been very threatened by this, to the point of trying to steal Local SEO by paying for sponsored articles/posts/ads. Let’s call the item “Item A”. Basically when someone searches on google “Item A near me” in my area, then my store and my competitors store pops up on google maps. The sponsored posts have titles like **Why you shouldn’t search for “Item A near me”****Why buying Item A locally is dangerous**. One company has even paid for an article in a local magazine (in my area) to write about how bad local Item A stores are. They talk about how local stores sell counterfeit “Item A” or how local stores aren’t knowledgeable about it. How online companies are superior to them in every way. 

This is complete bs. There is no difference in products between in-person vs online, In fact in-person can be better because they interact with a real life human instead of just through email. Anyways, it’s gotten to the point where the semi-defamatory articles are becoming a real problem and threat to my business. I’ve thought about contacting my local competitor to team up with them to figure out a way to combat this, an “enemy of my enemy is my friend” situation.

I thought a lot about the frameworks and mindsets that are needed to make decisions in the imperfect information world of poker, and how it would be extremely applicable to building startups.

Being able to think probabilistically, think long term, and not be results oriented are critical skills needed for founders and startup employees. I wrote a book about this, and I've made it free to read on Amazon until Thursday May 28th! I think this community will enjoy the book, it deep dives into these frameworks, and gives fun poker examples and real life business cases including Netflix, Airbnb, Uber, and more.

post,gs9bhc,,"$TSLA - Goldman sees price cut as a ""modest negative""","Tesla's website showed price reductions for multiple models as of May 26, 2020. It reduced the starting price for a base Model 3 by $2k or 5% to about $38k, and reduced the price for both the Long Range Plus and Performance Model S/X by $5k or 5-6%. Tesla made no change to the Model Y price.

Tesla said in late April it would reduce price of its standard range Model 3 in China so keep its eligibility for government incentives, and also previously said it would likely reduce prices more broadly as costs fell. However, Tesla didn't specifically mention a near-term price reduction pending for the US market. The street had been modelling ASP reductions more due to mix shift than outright price reductions.

Goldman believes the recent price reductions may be in response to: 1) more aggressive incentives in the light vehicle market more broadly (industry incentives in April were up more than 25% y/y to \~$4.3K per vehicle according to Autodata), 2) improved cost for Tesla, and/or 3) due to weaker end demand.",1017,False,1590682906.0,2020-05-28 18:21:46,4,21,street-guru,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/gs9bhc/tsla_goldman_sees_price_cut_as_a_modest_negative/,True,0.75,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,gvcuey,,Why you should buy TSLA before its too late,"For those who think TSLA stock is over valued, its only shoot up even more. So many people are buying DGLY as a spec stock for the protest, imagine the potential for TSLA stock. Imagine the potential cyber truck have on the market after the protest. Many of the police cars have there windows broken and lit on fire, as well as many other civilian cars. It will be logical to think that after the protest is over the police will buy something that will be more protective to prevent that from happening again like the cyber truck with the strong reinforced windows. On top of that many police and civilian cars are destroyed so there will be some demand for cars.

If you watch the jay leno video of the cybertruck at 1:00, you can hear elon musk jokingly say how when the apocalypse come we should be glad that its bullet proof, we are a leader in apocalypse technology

This is just not for the police, seeing all these video on police brutality, correct me if im wrong, but from what i recall, most of the deadly encounter with police occurs when there is only a single police officer. If you own a cybertruck and get pulled over by an aggressive police, you can always say im staying here until your supervisor comes to de-esclate the situation. What is the police going to do?  smash the window? that's not happening. On top of that, many of these incidents are gone unrecorded and require police complaince of turning on there body camera, there are also instances where it is not  on. Owning a Tesla, you have sentry mode to protect yourself.

In california, Model 3 not only outsell cars from its own segment, BMW 3 series, but they also outsold honda civic and toyota corolla.

post,h7ojke,,Intelligent drive systems,"I went from a 2016 SQ5 which had no 'intelligent drive' features apart from blind spot monitoring and parking sensors/rear cam to a 2020 C43. 

I have a lot of highway driving for my commute about 50 kilometres each way, and my work schedule requires me to often drive home late at night when I'm tired. 

I was very interested in getting a Tesla and the model 3 when was first being announced due to their autonomous driving features, but the look was not to my taste.

I put down a deposit on the Polestar 2 because they also will have ""autopilot"" and I like how it looks but their delivery estimate was Q3 of this year and I needed a car sooner. So I had to cancel it. That sucked as I was really looking forward to it.

In the end because I could not get an electric car that I wanted and I didn't want a big car but I wanted  awd I ended up on the C43.

I checked off the intelligent Drive option without really looking into it, I thought it would be the usual lane departure warning, adaptive cruise, 360 camera.

What I found over the past few months of driving it approx 6000 km,  is that I can't imagine how good the Tesla system must be if this is what Mercedes has in their 2020 model. 

My car on the highway basically driving itself, speeds up/ slows down, comes to a complete stop and starts up again, follows curvy roads, recognize the speed limit changes and then slows down to match the speed limit or speeds up. It even changes lanes!

I feel so much more comfortable driving home at night. It even has an attention assist.

I know autonomous driving is still quite far off but I I'm so excited to see in the next couple years when I have to send this car back what my options are going to be.

1/ TSLA EV like AAPL iPhone. Disruptive technology makes existing players obsolete
2/ New EVs don’t compete with other EVs. New EVs replace ICE.
3/ TSLA’s edge: integrated software and battery tech
4/ Strategy: Drive battery costs down to make EVs cheaper than ICE
5/ TSLA brand synonymous w/EV
6/ Huge runway: EV 3% share, 25%  by 2025, 100% by 2030
7/ Biz model: word-of-mouth, social media, customers as advocates
8/Growth driven by TAM expansion, leverage brand to new segments
9/ Competitive disarray: ICE brand taint, software deficient

Case for 2030 TSLA $8,000 PT:
1/ TSLA currently has 17% share of the global EV market, and EVs hold just 2.7% of the global auto market, so TSLA has just 0.5% share of the overall market of 80M veh/yr. By 2030, EVs likely to hold 100% of the market (remember stick shifts?)..

2/ If in 2030 TSLA still holds 17% SOM of EVs, TSLA will sell 80M x 17% = 13.6M cars. At $10K GP/car, less $10B of R&D & SGA/yr and 20% TaxRt, TSLA 2030 NI = $100B [(13.6M x $10K-$10B) x (1-20%)].  In 2019, AAPL had $55B NI and $1.6T MC.  For TSLA $1.6T market cap =$8,000 2030 PT

post,hq9xfh,,"Please, Don’t Get Your Hopes Up-","I feel it’s necessary for someone to talk about this.

Battery Day expeditions are so out of reality right now, it’s really concerning. This is mostly from new Tesla owners and uninformed investors. YouTube channels like (notably) TeslaBruh have been spreading disinformation about this for a while.
——-

“1. Battery day will have revamps and new cars”

I have heard so many theories about a compact coupe or a revamp of S/X.

There is no evidence to support any of these claims. 
——-

“2. Battery day will have immediate impacts.”

I see this a lot, YouTube videos like “Supercharging will be obsolete after Battery Day”

Density per square inch of a battery can only be so high. Right now, I think per square inch, electricity is 70% less efficient than gasoline. Physically, that number can probably only get to around 20% - in years and years. 

I don’t think you see physical battery impacts from battery day until Giga (Tulsa or Texas) is up and running. Nevada is (probably) not ready for an extra battery facility yet. Switching up the current supply lines could be a bankrupting mistake, especially without a fallback option.

[Giga Nevada Production ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/transportation/2018/11/30/18118451/tesla-gigafactory-nevada-video-elon-musk-jobs-model-3) 
———-

“3. Your battery will get ‘bigger.’”

I don’t know where to begin with this one.

Your battery will not get bigger. Chances are Tesla releases a software update that maximizes efficiency for older cars, maybe adding range to your car, but your battery ain’t getting bigger.

post,hvkkg1,,Tesla Battery Tech Advantages Widely Underappreciated By Market,"The battery is the heart of the electric vehicle, which is why Tesla puts a lot of effort and investment into its development. At the upcoming Battery Day, the company promised to provide investors with the results of its work in this critical area. However, Tesla's battery technology is already excellent and the gap will only widen over time, said Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster.


Munster argues that Tesla's leadership in battery packs is sustainable, and Tesla's competitive edge in batteries is currently underestimated by investors.

 

""We believe Tesla has a competitive advantage in batteries that is under-appreciated by investors. In the future, we expect that advantage to widen.

Bottom line: Tesla’s lead in batteries is sustainable and other auto OEMs will struggle to gain measurable ground on the company’s 80% US EV market share.""

Most of the lithium-ion battery cells used to make the Tesla battery are manufactured by Panasonic at Gigafactory 1 in Nevada. Loup Ventures estimates that over 60% of Panasonic's battery production currently goes to Tesla. The two companies recently signed a three-year pricing agreement for the production of battery cells at Gigafactory Nevada.

In addition, the Californian company has partnered with the Chinese battery supplier CATL and South Korean maker LG Chem. However, Tesla itself has proprietary cell chemistry that is different from the cell chemistry that Panasonic, CATL, and LG Chem sell to other automakers.

""That said, Tesla is experimenting with its own battery cell design through its 2019 acquisition of Maxwell Technologies. If those efforts yield a breakthrough in performance, Tesla would keep the cell design and chemistry proprietary. Separately, based on the company’s 2019 acquisition of Hibar Systems, we expect Tesla will begin manufacturing its own batteries in the next three to five years.""

post,i5jdxo,,"Sen. Sanders proposes one-time tax that would cost Bezos $42.8 billion, Musk $27.5 billion","Under the bill, tech and other business titans who have seen their wealth shoot up during the pandemic would take huge charges. Amazon and Walmart, for example, have both seen their stocks grow as Americans increasingly relied on their services during stay-at-home orders during the pandemic.

That added billions of dollars in wealth for their top shareholders, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT) founding family the Waltons, respectively.

Here’s how much some would pay under the bill due to wealth gains between March 18 and Aug. 5, according to a [release](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/make-billionaires-pay-fact-sheet?id=788A69A1-3162-4E3D-BC12-0BB8346423A0&amp;download=1&amp;inline=file) accompanying the bill:

* [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos would pay a one-time wealth tax of $42.8 billion.
* [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TSLA) and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk would pay a one-time wealth tax of $27.5 billion.
* [Facebook](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg would pay a one-time wealth tax of $22.8 billion.
* The Walton family would pay a one-time wealth tax of $12.9 billion.

Those figures could rise (or lower) as the effect of the pandemic on the billionaires’ wealth changes over the rest of the year.

post,ifgljn,,Don't take your Model Y on gravel roads.,"Long time lurker. Coming out of the shadows for a PSA.

I have a 2015 85D Model S

Heavy investor in TSLA (paid for both cars, thanks Elon!)

We purchased a Model Y to replace an old SUV. The girlfriend's parents live on a dirt road. A road we've taken many times with the S and all other cars we've owned. This damage is from a single trip! I kept the speed around 25mph.

The picture is after cleaning the car. Every single white dot you see is a paint chip. Unbelievable. I'm sure a clear bra would have mitigated most if not all of these but who knew I'd basically have to wrap the whole car?? Don't make the same mistake I did.

Don't buy a Model Y unless you stay in the city or get the rear doors wrapped.

post,ii4j0z,,‘It’s been priced in’ not so sure..,"I see this comment a lot when people are talking about buying a stock because of a future event. 

Gonna use Tesla as an example.

I’m long on Tesla and will be for a while, and I think this run up is partly to do with the split but also people realising they could literally be the biggest company in the world by the end of the decade. 

But I don’t really get the idea of the whole ‘priced in’ analogy.

The stock is at where it is now, and who knows, it might be there because people are excited on what’s to come. Let’s pretend it’s at 2200 because of all their future innovations. But what happens when Elon releases FSD, unleashes the robotaxi network, confirms first solid deliveries of the cybertruck and announces the new Roadster, the stock is just going to go up isn’t it..?

Regardless of what event is ‘priced in’, when that big event happens like any of the above, the news will still drive the stock price up, so no, it wasn’t really priced in. I think there’s a distinction between the excitement of something happening (driving price up), and the actually event happening, which will just put it up more.

Here's what I cover:

* The kind of content you need to convert prospects
* Shortcuts to creating great content quickly - so you can still run your business!
* Simple formulas for creating compelling blogs, videos and more
* A how-to system to set your content distribution to autopilot

post,ikmanx,,NIO,"Recently, 
I did some research into NIO. I know it has been operating at a loss, but I like their business model, in particular the battery swapping system and the recently launched BAAS( battery as a service); you can buy the car without battery at a huge discount and then subscribe to loan a battery. I think long term this model may be better than the Tesla supercharger system( it prevent the batteries from deteriorating). The problem I see is that it seems a business model difficult ( or at least expensive) to export outside China, and one that make impossible for them to sell cars outside China before building swapping stations in the countries they want to sell cars. Luckily , the chinese market may be big enough in the coming years.

post,inr451,,Intel : the big picture and why I'm bullish on it,"I will start off my discsussion using a couple of examples where investors/analysts missed the big picture and the company/stock has proven that they're much more than that.

**Microsoft**


In July 2013, Microsoft stock had the biggest drop of the century after reporting their earnings. The stock dropped because of investors disappointment in the Surface RT laptop. They ignored the biggest elephant in the room that is Windows Azure, now known as Microsoft Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing division and it has been the major growth driver for Microsoft. Of course, the CEO change from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella helped but Satya's vision was all about cloud computing and it was completely ignored by investors at that time. 

https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/19/as-shares-fall-12-percent-microsoft-experiences-its-biggest-drop-since-2000/

**Apple**

Back in 2018, investors/analysts were focusing on iPhone X sales figures. Warren Buffett saw the big picture. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said long-term investors of Apple’s stock shouldn’t obsess with near-term iPhone sales. “The idea that you’re going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point,” he stated. His big picture was looking at Apple as a brand and its ecosystem

https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/30/warren-buffett-says-he-bought-just-a-little-more-apple-recently.html

Look at where Microsoft and Apple stocks were then and where they are trading at now.


**Intel**

I'd like to use the same logic for Intel. It dropped 20% after the earnings call last quarter in July. The big picture  Intel's Investors/analysts are  missing is that they are ignoring this industry leader’s methodical transition into higher growth businesses and focusing solely on solvable supply chain problems ( 10 nm/7 nm transistor density issues). I will not be discussing the fact that AMD/NVidia are using 7 nm process and that Intel isn't.",7778,True,1599416734.0,2020-09-06 20:25:34,371,193,sk169,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/inr451/intel_the_big_picture_and_why_im_bullish_on_it/,True,0.88,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

[My electric journey](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/hhwgxr/buying_an_electric_car_my_journey/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

A few redditors contacted me to post a review once I got my car. So here it is: 

(P.S: Apologies for any grammatical and typo errors, I’m doing this from my phone and will edit if I spot them once posted)

Ive had the car almost a week now and have driven over 300 miles in it. I’ve driven it over a mixture of A and B roads (these are the more narrow twisty but fast roads in the UK), also motorways and country lanes.

The review will be as follows: 1: The first minute, 2: Outside, 3: Inside, 4: Handling &amp; Performance, 5: Technology, 6: Living with it. 7: Verdict.

The exact model I have is the A250 e saloon AMG line with premium pack. In white with black AMG 5 spoke wheels and black interior with red stitching.


1: The First Minute

The car was delivered from the back of the lorry, having only tested the hatchback version, even from looking at pictures I was not 100% what the saloon would look like “in real life”. After it rolled off the lorry and into my driveway I was in awe of its dimensions. It didn’t look like a hatchback trying to be a saloon, it looked like a car in its own right. I had to read the back of the car to convince myself that this is an indeed an A Class, the baby of the pack. But baby it was not. It’s as big the older CLA bar a few shavings here and there and was surprisingly wider than I thought. It’s sleek, the back end tapers off nicely towards the rear of the car giving it a pleasing aerodynamic curve.

Nikola ([NKLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NKLA?p=NKLA&.tsrc=fin-srch)📷) and GM ([GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM)📷) are teaming up to take on Tesla’s cybertruck.

The electric truck startup announced Tuesday it has selected GM to be its manufacturing parter for its electric pickup truck dubbed the Badger. The Badger will use GM’s widely acclaimed Ultium battery technology. Additionally, Nikola will hand over $2 billion in stock to GM — giving the automaker an 11% stake in the company.

“Nikola is one of the most innovative companies in the world. General Motors is one of the top engineering and manufacturing companies in the world. You couldn’t dream of a better partnership than this,” said Nikola founder and executive chairman Trevor Milton in a statement. “By joining together, we get access to their validated parts for all of our programs, General Motors’ Ultium battery technology and a multi-billion dollar fuel cell program ready for production. Nikola immediately gets decades of supplier and manufacturing knowledge, validated and tested production-ready EV propulsion, world-class engineering and investor confidence. Most importantly, General Motors has a vested interest to see Nikola succeed. We made three promises to our stakeholders and have now fulfilled two out of three promises ahead of schedule. What an exciting announcement.” 

Added GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra, “This strategic partnership with Nikola, an industry leading disrupter, continues the broader deployment of General Motors’ all-new Ultium battery and Hydrotec fuel cell systems. “We are growing our presence in multiple high-volume EV segments while building scale to lower battery and fuel cell costs and increase profitability. In addition, applying General Motors’ electrified technology solutions to the heavy-duty class of commercial vehicles is another important step in fulfilling our vision of a zero-emissions future.",2498,True,1599566389.0,2020-09-08 13:59:49,1018,438,addictedtostuckporn,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ios954/nikola_and_gm_team_up_to_make_900horsepower_super/,True,0.94,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,iq5wdn,,Question re: 2020/2021 outlook for Business (Import/Export)," 

Hi guys first time poster in this sub, I'm hoping for some additional insight.

My partners and I specialize in AI driven B2B Brokerage (connecting Supplier A with Client B).

We've recently successfully exited the PPE space, and want to apply our success there with the Manufacturing world in other markets. we've made headway with manufacturers in China, Vietnam, USA, Canada and Morocco who want us to connect them with buyers, and there's no shortage of options or demand.

which brings me to my question: we can essentially go in almost any direction with regards to sourcing, whether it be raw, semi finished or finished goods; we are a little overwhelmed with the vast options out there as a starting point/industry/product .

we're looking for products/markets that will have a significant demand/uptick throughout the next year either as a result of the pandemic and new production cycles, or not.

our interest is volume deals, and collecting a performance fee/commission on the deals we bring.

Which market (NOT PPE) would you propose to focus on for the next 6-12 months ?

TL:DR - Have an Artificial Intelligence company that is doing commission driven lead generation. Which markets/products would you suggest to focus on as they will be in high demand over the next year?

post,iw0dvg,,A Deep Dive into Nikola's FCEV Design and Price Model,"Hey everyone.  I'm a mechanical engineering student with a hobby interest in finance.  I've spent the last few days figuring out if Nikola's leasing model is actually possible.  There's some really wacky stuff going on in Nikola's presentations and financial projections, and I wanted to share my findings.

&#x200B;

This is an absolute wall of words, and I wouldn't be offended if you didn't want to read it all.  In the first half, I try to tease out the cost per mile of an actual Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) given the specification Nikola lists.   Next there is a portion where I look at the discrepancies between their Financial Projections and their Lease breakdown.   Then a quick little peanut gallery where I look at their unrealistic assumptions and the hypocrisy of their comparisons.  Finally, a more serious portion where I discuss the design, efficiency, and utility implications of Nikola's chosen power output and battery capacity.  Hope you guys enjoy!

&#x200B;

Let's get started:

Nikola claims that they have the industry first holistic leasing program, including maintenance, fuel, and use of the vehicle. They plan on leasing for $.95 per mile @ 30% margin.  This implies an expense of ~~$.73~~ $.67 per mile to Nikola.

**Hydrogen costs:**

According to the DoE, it currently costs $5.10/kg to produce, compress, and dispense hydrogen.  Nikola claims they can do this for $2.47/kg.  I highly doubt their estimate, and will elaborate on that later.  Hydrogen has a specific energy 33.3 kWh/kg.  A Fuel cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) has an average thermal efficiency of 55%.  A diesel semi tractor, which easily compares to Nikola’s offerings, consumes about 1.25 kWh of work per km (or 2.125 per mile) of useful work loaded.

This implies the Nikola truck will use 3.86 kWh of hydrogen per mile, at a cost of $0.59 per mile, or $.29 using their estimates.",20755,True,1600548077.0,2020-09-19 22:41:17,1111,196,thri54,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/iw0dvg/a_deep_dive_into_nikolas_fcev_design_and_price/,True,0.97,2020,both,search,False,False,0,
post,ix4uwt,,I feel I am a “wantrepreneur” and I am seeking ongoing coaching.,"
Without trying to sound as I want sympathy, but more that I want you to have a background of who I am, where I currently stand and where I know I can go. 

I grew up in a small town in Texas in semi violent broken home, father left when I was 1 so then was raised by my mother and 2 older sisters. I moved in with my aunt and uncle at age 17 when my mother was on life support and almost passed. She’s still alive but her health is that of an 85 y/o and she’s only 62. 

After high school I begged my way into this healthcare company as a grunt worker because I thought the female sales reps were hot and the guys looked badass in suits.  Months after joining the company at age 20 they were starting a new healthcare sterilization consulting (ensured that sterilization departments in hospitals for surgery were in compliance with regulations, efficiencies, process improvement, resource management, surgeon satisfaction, increase surgeries, ROIC, education etc.) division in which required me to leave Texas for Georgia, so I said “what do I have to lose!?!” 

Fast forward 13 years (age 33) with the company and I held various cap positions due to promotions and just being relentlessly resourceful. My positions were; technician leadership, project management, surgical liaison. I worked in over 60 hospitals across 36 state’s and finally achieved my grail a full blown consultant.

I know no longer work for the company as I wanted to stop travel and get married so I got a management job at a hospital in which I was suspiciously canned 1 month. So basically for these last 3 years I have focused on building a viable consulting service not only in the direct field I was in but business in general. Over the years I have built and kept tools, surveys, calculators, proposals, quantitative and qualitative analysis etc.

post,ixyrff,,"Elon Musk says Tesla deliveries will rise 30% to 40% in 2020, touts new battery tech","Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday he expects vehicle deliveries to increase by 30 to 40 percent over last year, when the company reported deliveries of 367,500 vehicles. The new guidance from Musk implies deliveries of between 477,750 and 514,500 cars, a range that encompasses the company’s previously stated goal to deliver half a million cars in 2020.

Musk offered the updated numbers during the company’s 2020 shareholder’s meeting on Tuesday afternoon, which was accompanied by a presentation about Tesla’s battery advances. After thanking Tesla owners for their word-of-mouth marketing, he noted: 


“In 2019, we had 50% growth. And I think we’ll do really pretty well in 2020, probably somewhere between 30 to 40 percent growth, despite a lot of very difficult circumstances.”

The company’s shares dropped more than 6% during the presentation, which took place after normal trading hours.

During the “battery day” portion of the presentation, Tesla confirmed that it is making its own battery cells at a facility in Fremont.

Joining Musk on stage, Tesla’s senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, Drew Baglino, described the new cells as a “large tabless cell,” with a “shingled spiral” design. The cells are larger than the ones Tesla purchases from Panasonic and other suppliers, and offer “thermal benefits” which make them appropriate for use in electric vehicles. 

Baglino said battery, manufacturing and design changes underway at Tesla would eventually “unlock” a 54% improvement in the range of the company’s vehicles.

Musk, who is famous for being overly optimistic on such matters, said with all the battery and manufacturing advances Tesla is working on: “About 3 years from now, we’re confident we can make a very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that’s also fully autonomous.”

post,j1z2f8,,"To what extent is Tesla really ""overvalued""?","### Disclaimer

I do not have a financial position in any of the companies mentioned here, and have no intention to initiate one within the next 72 hours.

&#x200B;

# Introduction

A common belief is that Tesla is grossly comically overvalued. Most people who express that belief point to Tesla's insanely high price to earnings ratio (P/E) to make the argument.

Tesla's current P/E is (1038). A P/E of 1000+ is patently absurd. To compare with high growth technology companies (FAANG):

* Facebook: 32.31
* Apple: 36.42
* Amazon: 131.34
* Netflix: 122.87
* Google: 27.75
* Average: 70.138

[Source (Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/)

Despite not enjoying the massive margins of the tech companies, Tesla has a P/E ratio 14.7 times greater than their average. This is simply ludicrous.

&#x200B;

# Caveats

While Tesla's P/E ratio is Prima Facie outrageous, I am of the opinion that it doesn't paint the full picture:

* Tesla's margins per car are around 20%.
* Tesla's profit margins were 1 - 2%.
   * This is a very low profit margin that leads to a relatively tiny denominator. Tesla has only just begun to turn a profit, and the margin is expected to grow significantly in future.
* Tesla's revenue growth over the last 5 years is > 50%.
   * Tesla's growth is one of the causes of their low profit margins as they're investing a lot in new factories.

&#x200B;

The below excerpt sums up my take pretty well:

>Alphabet in 2007 was clearly cheaper than Tesla is today. Alphabet’s price/sales ratio was only moderately below Tesla’s level, but its price/book ratio was much lower. In addition, Alphabet had meaningful profits, which traded at a relatively modest P/E ratio of 50 – a steep multiple for most companies but not for one growing as rapidly as Alphabet. In contrast, **Tesla has only just begun to turn a profit.**

post,j28ihg,,Walmart Triples Tesla Semi Order In Canada,"Walmart Canada has more than tripled its order for Tesla Semi trucks in a show of confidence for the all-electric heavy-duty vehicles and the ability of its maker to deliver them.   

The Canadian division of retailer **Walmart, Inc.** [WMT 0.08%](https://benzinga.com/stock/wmt#NYSE) said Tuesday it reserved 130 of the trucks. Once in service, Walmart will have one of the biggest electric truck fleets in Canada as part of a companywide goal to [achieve zero emissions by 2040](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/walmarts-goal-for-its-trucks-no-more-diesel-by-2040). 

""I'm excited to have my drivers drive this truck,"" Francis Lalonde, Walmart Canada's vice president for transportation, told FreightWaves.

Walmart Canada expects to get its Teslas in 2021. Lalonde wouldn't detail the delivery schedule, but said the company has full confidence in **Tesla Inc.** [TSLA 0.51%](https://benzinga.com/stock/tsla#NASDAQ) ability to deliver them.

""We trust our partner,"" he said.  

The Teslas will operate within Canada as part of Walmart's private fleet of around 300 trucks with about 500 drivers. Their 500-mile range provides a good fit for Canadian fleet operations, which have drivers return to their distribution centers each day.

Walmart Canada has looked at other zero-emissions vehicles, but the Tesla Semi has so far proven the best one for its fleet, Lalonde said. Beyond the range and ability to haul 80,000-pound loads, the Tesla safety features — including its collision-avoiding autopilot — were an important selling point. 

""I firmly believe these are the safest trucks out there,"" Lalonde said. 

## ‘We've done our homework' on Tesla, Walmart executive says

> Hyliion’s mission is to be the leading provider of electrified powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle industry. Hyliion’s goal is to reduce the carbon intensity and GHG emissions of the transportation sector by providing electrified powertrain solutions for Class 8 commercial vehicles at the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO). Hyliion’s solutions utilize its proprietary battery systems, control software and data analytics combined with fully integrated electric motors and power electronics, to produce electrified powertrain systems that either augment—in the case of Hyliion’s Hybrid systems—or fully replace—in the case of the fully electric Hypertruck ERX system—traditional diesel or natural gas fueled powertrains and improve their performance. By reducing both GHG emissions and TCO, Hyliion’s environmentally conscious solutions support its customers’ pursuit of their sustainability and financial objectives.

We all know Elon loves to surprise people - and this is probably on the future docket.

UPDATE: TL/DR: looks like they just filed with SEC for Starlink in moving vehicles. BOOM CALLED IT. 

https://www.teslarati.com/starlink-moving-vehicles-tesla-fcc-application/

I drive a 2020 Model X. I was on the freeway in autopilot just looking at my Robinhood app (safely of course...) and I was waiting for it to load. waiting... and waiting... We all know the internet on a Tesla isn't exactly the best. It's pretty dull to be honest. And then it got me thinking... Why? Why is the internet so bad on a Tesla. Surely Elon has a reason to overlook such a fundamental detail of an otherwise very futuristic car. And then I started down the rabbit hole....

I remembered a series called ""Future Car"" with Neil Degrassi Tyson a few years back and there was this quote that he said that always stuck with me (i'm paraphrasing as best I can here..)...

""In the future - cars will be able to travel within 2 inches of each other at 200 mph... because cars will talk to each other. One car will be able to hit a pot hole in the middle of a lane, and then communicate to a network to the rest of the fleet that a pot hole exists there, and to avoid it. The rest of the fleet can then maneuver safely around it.""

It was at this point then that I looked over at my dashboard and admired the new Tesla update - the fancy schmancy new Suspension update that shows the real time bounce and shock rate of each strut. Man that's a lot of data....

post,jfks8m,,Tesla crushes Q3 Earnings with record profits,"

Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) third-quarter earnings for 2020 saw the electric car maker post $8.771 billion in revenue, beating Wall Street’s expectations. The results, which were discussed at length in an Update Letter, were released after the closing bell on Wednesday, October 21, 2020.

Tesla’s third-quarter was impressive, with the electric car maker producing a total of 145,036 vehicles comprised of 16,992 Model S and Model X and 128,044 Model 3 and Model Y. The company also delivered 139,300 vehicles comprised of 124,100 Model 3 and Model Y, as well as 15,200 Model S and Model X.

Tesla’s strong Q3 results were likely due to the Model Y ramp in the United States and the increasing Model 3 production at Gigafactory Shanghai. With these, expectations were high that Tesla would once more post a profit this third quarter.


The following are the key points in Tesla’s Q3 2020 Update Letter.

REVENUE
Tesla reported a revenue of $8.771 billion for the third quarter, beating Wall Street’s expectations. In comparison, Wall Street expected Tesla’s Q3 2020 revenue at $8.28 billion, as per FactSet consensus. 

EARNINGS
Tesla shareholders saw non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.76 in the third quarter. In comparison, Wall Street expected Tesla to report a gain of $0.57 per share.

Here are some of enormous advantages (there are much more of them) of Tesla that people speak about, what do you agree on?

\- They will earn 10 times more on each car than usual car company on gasoline car, while they still keep losing money on their EVs

\- Tesla will create the self driving technology and it will earn them a huge amount of money by using the cars as robotaxies, no one is near, because of the huge amounts of data they collect

\- The insurance of car will earn billions because the FSD (full self driving and autonomous driving) will reduce the car accidents by 99% in several years

\- Tesla is going to be the electricity grid company, and it will give them another huge area, and in this area too, they will dominate because of their ability to innovate

\- They will sell as many cars as they produce, because they can reduce prices, they earn 25% on each car, and they reduce constantly the production costs

\- The capacity will grow from 500K now to 2 million cars per year by 2022 (adding Austin and Berlin, enhancing Shanghai, others may be added, India talks)

\- They do not waste money on ads and on dealers, these expenses will go to the customers and the stock owners

\- They do the vertical integration will reduces the expenses dramatically

\- They are innovators, they figure out how to do the car innovations (more than 100 significant innovations) that make cars better in any parameter, while other companies succeed to copy only 10% of what Tesla does

\- They have a huge technical advantage over other car companies and this advantage is only growing

\- Tesla users are fans because they understand how amazing their products are, similarly to Apple, the biggest company in the world

\- Tesla has a huge advantage on their own battery cells, and it is patented, it will be 50% times cheaper and 50% higher capacity, will last 5 times longer, just amazing

post,jgandy,,FSD/Robotaxi Adoption,"I’ve been a Tesla/TSLA owner and Elon fan since 2012. I believe in their mission, vision, products, technological achievement, and more.  

One thing I’m a pretty big skeptic about is the adoption of FSD, especially for the robotaxi use case.  I get that there is a large amount of people out there that may live in more urban areas who don’t want to own a car, and just need one to take quick trips/errands.  There are also many other use cases like sending my kid to school or practice.

But then, there are a lot of people, dare I say the majority, who: 
- see owning a Tesla as aspirational
- covet, take care, mod their Tesla
- love to drive their Tesla and find joy from their Tesla (Elon has said this is the most important thing)
- don’t necessarily want their Tesla model to also become the next generic yellow taxi

Then there’s also the general public who are:
- afraid or skeptical of new technology
- can be downright hateful of new technology (picture people road raging on slower moving robotaxis)
- who aren’t going to let go of their driving ie “don’t tell me I can’t drive” similar to “don’t tell me I can’t have my gun”
So basically the deniers and those that refuse to believe the good that can come out of autonomous cars (lives saved, better for environment, more productive time, etc).

I wonder if the sum of all of this, along with slow legislation, is the usual political and social quagmire that we see all too often in our country right now?

post,jjuf16,,Consumer Reports: Tesla Autopilot 'a distant second' to GM's Super Cruise in hands-free test,"Tesla Autopilot 'a distant second' to GM's Super Cruise in hands-free test: Consumer Reports

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co's (GM.N) Super Cruise once again edged Tesla's (TSLA.O) Autopilot in an evaluation of 17 vehicles equipped with active driving assistance systems (ADAS) by Consumer Reports, the testing organization said on Wednesday.

A Tesla Model Y fitted with Autopilot finished ""a distant second,"" the group said, to a Cadillac CT6 equipped with Super Cruise, which GM is rolling out to more than 20 vehicles - including its new Hummer electric pickup truck - over the next three years.

Safety and insurance researchers have frequently warned of the risks of consumers overestimating ADAS systems' abilities, a misconception increased by some automakers calling their products Autopilot, ProPilot or Co-Pilot.

In 2018, the Cadillac CT6 with Super Cruise scored higher than a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot, in a Consumer Reports test of just four vehicles equipped with ADAS.

In the latest test, conducted this summer on a track and on public roads, the Cadillac scored 69 points out of a possible 100, while the Tesla scored 57. A Lincoln Corsair equipped with Ford Motor Co's (F.N) Co-Pilot 360 system, finished third with 52.

The critical difference in the Super Cruise system is a driver-facing infrared camera to make sure he or she is paying attention to the road and is ready to take over manual control when necessary, said Kelly Funkhouser, head of connected and automated vehicle testing at Consumer Reports.

The group noted that Autopilot can shut off abruptly in some situations, while Super Cruise did a better job of notifying the driver when the system is disengaging.

In recent European safety testing, a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot placed sixth out of 10 systems, getting high marks for performance and ability to respond to emergencies, but falling short on its ability to maintain a driver’s focus on the road.

post,jk4pxy,,An extensive Lotus Elise Review,"I’ve always wanted to experience a Lotus Elise. Unlike some Lotus fan boys I don’t particularly have a moral affinity for the Lotus “add lightness” and driver focused ethos (although I think those two things make these very enjoyable cars), I’ve just always thought that the Elise looked really cool and was the most exotic looking thing that I could actually afford. 

With my birthday coming around the corner, and after finding myself constantly browsing through Elise listings, I decided to rent one to see once and for all what the car is all about. 

I have a few disclaimers that I would like to add. 

I have spent extensive time with the following vehicles: C5 Corvette, C7  Corvette Grand Sport, C8 Corvette Z51, Alfa Romeo 4C,  718 Porsche Cayman Base, 997 Porsche 911 Turbo, Lotus Evora, Ford Focus RS,  Tesla Model 3 AWD, Audi R8 V8, and Audi TTRS. I will be forming my opinion with this pantheon of vehicles in mind. 

I find that a lot of Elise reviews focus too much on the car’s uniqueness and don’t do a good job of explaining how the car stacks up to other vehicles. While I won’t be doing an in-depth comparison per say, I do want to try to illustrate what this car might mean for other enthusiasts who have experienced other vehicles already. In other words I’m not going to go “Oh my god the trunk is so small” every YouTube review says that already. I’m going to really try to focus on the intangibles that don’t get highlighted in magazine or YouTube reviews. 

**Power** 

As somebody who owned a C5 Corvette, C7 Grandsport, and currently daily drives a Tesla Model 3 power was a major concern for me when driving the Elise. The car only has a 190HP engine with around 130LB/Ft of torque. Yes it is in a 2000lb-ish body which gives it a good power to weight ratio but that’s still not a whole lot of power on paper. 

The good news is that the Elise’s engine is strong enough to give you a very satisfying time in the car.",23308,True,1603951148.0,2020-10-29 06:59:08,144,50,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/jk4pxy/an_extensive_lotus_elise_review/,True,0.94,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,jljdrm,,The Economics of Airlines,"
The Wright brothers flew the first plane in 1917. At the time, going on an airplane was not common. Being a passenger on a flight was expensive. The focus for airlines was luxury. As time has passed, their focus has shifted from luxury to revenue. With the shift, airlines have grown their revenue sources. Airlines not only make money from passengers. They work with businesses to generate revenue.

## Bags
The range and fuel costs depend on the size and weight of the plane. The passenger bags add more weight and decrease the revenue for the airline. The airlines make up the costs by charging passengers for the bags. The heavier the bag then the more money a passenger will pay.

## Seats
A passenger has the option for three different seats. The seats available are economy, business, and first-class on an airline. The first-class and business classes are more expensive than economy seats. The economy seats account for the most revenue of any seat. There might be 20 first-class seats on a plane, which are the most expensive. But 30 rows of economy seats, the great number of economy seats leads to more revenue. The economy seats account for 80% of the seats on the plane. When fewer economy seats are being sold, the airline starts to lose money on their flights.

The pricing of the passenger ticket has many factors. The airline has a formula for pricing tickets. They use the destination, flight time, type of seat, seasonality.

The airline wants revenue for flights on their books as soon as possible. To fill up flights, they make the tickets cheaper when the flight is far out. There is a certain timeline for price changes. The cheapest a passenger can get a flight is 12 to 9 months out. 9 to 1 month out is the median price for a flight. The most expensive tickets are usually one month before the flight.

## How airlines make money from cargo
Airlines ship goods for other companies. The price of the cargo depends on the size, weight, type, and time.",11356,True,1604154874.0,2020-10-31 15:34:34,5,0,SupremeRumHam,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/jljdrm/the_economics_of_airlines/,True,0.78,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,jls65c,,Evolution of Automotive Propulsion,"Just nerdin' out. For reference, I'm an audio engineer by trade. Auto, and energy storage enthusiast.

&#x200B;

I'm a diehard ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) fan. But I can see, their time has come. Efficiency can no longer be avoided. The Model 3 is coming out to roughly 60-90 miles per gallon equivalent, based on charge costs. Huge, not to mention reduced maintenance costs.

I've also noticed there are more small displacement diesels in the US. They've always been all over other parts of the world. It is a more efficient engine, and the exhaust cleaning methods are improving  yearly.

I propose we see a shift towards a completely Diesel/Electric fuel system. The diesel fuel requires less refinement, thus less processing cost. As gasoline refinement is phased out, this will homogenize fuel production to diesel, further lowering fuel production costs, and allow governments to simplify taxation to one type of fuel and possible aid in reduction in at pump costs as well.

I've always argued we needed lower displacement and more turbos to increase volumetric efficiency. Got that. Now it's down to fuel production and distribution. Can you imagine guys building little 1.6l Turbo diesels pushing 90psi and 7000rpm? Or the EV guys gutting teslas and doing tri-motor mods and liquid nitrogen cooling systems?

post,jm049e,,Bread Seller,"I'm working middle management in a SoCal supermarket and recently I'm given charge of a bakery inside the store. My responsibilities are ordering and selling (finished and semi/finished products depending on category), scheduling for employees and checking for compliance with health department and company regulations. The second and third parts are easy. The problem is that I have no idea how to make or sell bread.

From my previous observations of this bakery, I know that: 

1. The products are subpar quality both for their taste and visual appeal and there's not much to be done about it because the bakers must cook according to a strict SoP designed by HQ. The price tags for these shitty breads are not cheap. The profit margin is thin because of the high cost HQ charge us.
2. The employees are mostly bored women in their 50s waiting for retirement. Minimum wage with no chance for raises and being short staffed means that they are not at all motivated to work harder than normal or take on extra responsibilities. They're also prone to get in arguments about ""who does what and what isn't my job"" with one another. 
3. Among other cheat tactics, HQ would occasionally force shit products that nobody orders to the bakery and charge full cost (or a generous 5% off) for it, all the while demanding sales and profit to grow because of the ""extra push"". 

 I don't know the products (\~400 total, of which \~200 are being sold regularly), I don't know the baking process or how much work it takes to produce. I'm not a shopper, I don't follow sales, I don't know what's attractive to customers because I'm never attracted as a customer. I always buy what I need when I need and bread's never been on that list. I'm also terrible at shilling products to strangers. I'd tell the customer that the bread is shit and they can get something better for cheaper next door.

post,jmw6mo,,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, November 2, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 2, 2020**

Stocks opened today’s session higher before paring some gains ahead of an extremely busy week, with market participants closely monitoring the results of the US presidential election, a meeting of the Federal Reserve, and the October jobs report, and rising coronavirus numbers in the US and Europe.

After an extremely choppy day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.22% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 1.11% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing 1.56% up.

On Tuesday is the US presidential election between incumbent Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result,  it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016. If this pace picks up, this election could have the highest voter participation rate in over 100 years.

Regardless of the outcome, the election will have a number of consequences for Corporate America.",8096,True,1604351118.0,2020-11-02 22:05:18,107,22,psychotrader00,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jmw6mo/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_monday_november/,True,0.96,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

**TLDR:**

In one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.

TMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books

* How To Make Money in Stocks, William O'Neil
* Monster Stocks: How They Set Up, Run Up, Top and Make You Money , John Boik
* The Lifecycle Trade: How to Win at Trading IPOs and Super Growth Stocks, Eric Krull, Kathy Donnelly, and Kurt Dail

**A few Historical Examples** from William O'Neil's How To Find & Own America's Greatest Opportunities

Yahoo 1996 [https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ](https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ)

**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal.",4128,True,1604793787.0,2020-11-08 01:03:07,328,76,Rmogo21,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/jq1g92/what_is_a_true_market_leader_tml_and_how_to_find/,True,0.94,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

When shipping to Europe, Tesla already sends the papers to the customer before the car arrives, so that they can be registered beforehand and a smooth pickup is guaranteed. That is why some German owners already have registration for their cars that are due to be picked up in late November or December.

These papers state a battery capacity of 82 kWh. On the 2019 & 2020 Model 3 the capacity in the same paper is 79 kWh. The difference matches the 5% energy density increase mentioned in the article.

post,juc4ac,,I think I just became a believer in fun electric cars...,"Let me preface. It's not that I don't believe electric cars are the future. They absolutely are. The part I've always had a hard time believing is that they'd be able to stoke the same kind of emotions that gas powered performance vehicles can. The scream of engines, gear changes, and just all the different vibrations and feelings that come with these performance vehicles is something I struggled to understand how an electric vehicle would compete. I had the chance to drive a Model 3 Dual Motor a few months back, and while on paper the performance was really quite incredible, I didn't feel particularly moved by the car. It was just a way to get from A to B, albeit quickly.

Fast forward to today. I was at my local Porsche dealership looking at a car. As I was walking to the car, I walked past a whole line of Taycans (around 6-8), and I asked the sales adviser if they were all presold waiting on their owners to pick them up. Turns out they weren't, and they were all for sale. They were all a mix of 4S's and Turbos (no Turbo S's). Long story short, I got the keys to a 4S and went for a drive...

And my god was it fun. I cannot put into words the experience that car delivered. The car had soul, something the Tesla absolutely did not (to me). It felt like a performance car that just happened to have an electric drivetrain, not an electric drivetrain that just happened to have seats. I got back to the dealership, and found myself wondering if I wanted to trade my car in then and there.

I understand that a comparison of Porsche to Tesla is apples to oranges. But the fact that Porsche have managed to deliver a driving experience like I had today, in their first all electric production vehicle, gives me a lot of hope and optimism for the future of cars.

post,jwk3hi,,How to Send a Land Rover Defender Through a Car Wash?,"UPDATE 2-9-2021: Sorry for belated response! I never got notice of any replies or that this went live. 

Unfortunately we're all still confounded as to what to do about this vehicle. I tried shifting it into neutral and exiting from the passenger side, and that did work, but it's too risky to keep doing since my foot could bump the shifter on the way over. (Also, we can't simply shut the vehicle off either, as that will still trigger brake-hold and the parking gear.) 

I tried calling a dealership since my boss told me they should know since the vehicle has to be kept in neutral to do a wheel alignment (which I assume is done without someone staying in the driver seat), but they told me they didn't know either. I read through the relevant portions of the manual about brake-hold and whatnot, and saw no actionable advice.

We'll just have to keep sending employees through with the car until a solution pops up, but these new features can sure cause problems. The Model X and Y from Tesla, for instance, tends to lock if you leave all the doors closed for a few minutes, even with the card key inside. We had to have one customer unlock it with their phone app about five  times. 

-----

I work at an automatic car wash, and we're stumped as how to send a Land Rover Defender (2019-2020 model years) safely through without necessitating someone sitting in the driver seat. 

For cars that go through without a person in them, we leave them running while in neutral gear, and some vehicles have electronic shifters that require specific processes so that they don't shift (and stay) in park or activate a brake when you open the driver door. 

For instance, we have to put Teslas in tow or transport mode, and leave the driver seat belt buckled on Dodge Ram trucks with dial shifters, but none of our tricks work on the Defender so far. The parking brake stays on, and will reactivate itself immediately if you try to shut it off.

**Environment:** Garage with 220V Level 2 charger, outdoor temps ranging between -20F and 100F

Overall it's been a good experience.  I can't say I've had any moments where I looked forward to driving it, but I do catch myself from time to time thinking about how nice it is to drive.  The heated steering wheel is so, so nice on cold days and Apple CarPlay works flawlessly after a couple of iOS updates.  The maintenance schedule for the car has 3 total items: tire rotation, cabin air filter, and battery coolant flush at 150k miles.  I've done all of the tire rotations in my own garage and had the cabin air filter replaced at its only dealer visit for a software recall.

Electric range has been a non-issue with this car, the first time this has happened with any of my previous EVs.  I can count on one hand the number of times I've stopped at a public charger.  I could make my work commute 2-3 times without plugging in my garage at night.",5782,True,1605892697.0,2020-11-20 18:18:17,162,28,DanielTigerUppercut,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/jxt5tz/3_years_with_a_chevy_bolt/,True,0.97,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

I know one of the main considerations on it being truly clean is where your electricity comes from (i.e. solar, coal, gas, nuclear, etc) and how your batteries are charged.

post,jzhwhf,,The Tesla Bull Case in Brief,"**Disclaimer**

I have no financial position in Tesla at this point in time and no interest in initiating one within the next month.

&#x200B;

# Introduction

There seems to be a strong sentiment among some that Tesla is vastly overvalued, and that the current stock price is completely unrooted in reality. I understand the viewpoint, but don't really share the belief. That's not particularly surprising as I consider myself a Tesla optimist. I decided to present in brief the case for Tesla's valuation as I understand it.

&#x200B;

# Overvalued?

Tesla's current market capitalisation appears to be grossly overvalued, especially when compared to their peers in the automotive sector as [these charts so clearly illustrate](https://preview.redd.it/gdvz8sgmpz061.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=45524ed08b3899febc3fa9b67329569e25a906b9).

In fact, the charts actually understate things as Tesla's market cap currently seats at around $464 billion. You could add another Daimler to the US and EU listed companies and they would still have a lower market capitalisation than Tesla.

This really is the case for Tesla being overvalued: it's automotive revenues is many times it's current market capitalisation. [Per MarketWatch, Tesla's trailing PE is 978.44](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla/company-profile?mod=mw_quote_tab), so it's not as if Tesla is especially profitable either.

On a fundamentals basis, Tesla appears to be grossly overvalued.

&#x200B;

# Growth

The above chart doesn't necessarily indicate that Tesla's current market capitalisation is an extremely speculative bubble that could burst soon, but more that Tesla is not valued based on its current financial situation. Tesla is valued as an extreme growth company, and it's growth over the past five years bears this out.

My big question about this company is, how good is their battery technology? What makes it special? [They claim that](http://www.microvast.com/index.php/solutions):

* Car can be fully charged in 10-15 minutes.
* Batteries last life of the vehicle - no replacement necessary. (I think in one article they mentioned 20,000 cycles).
* Their Smart Thermal Liquid technology makes their battery extremely safe
* Their batteries are made from [Lithium Titanium Oxide](https://www.openpr.com/news/2073035/lto-battery-market-consumption-and-revenue-analysis-by-top-key) (LTO)
* Earlier this year they won a $4.5 million contract from United States Advanced Battery Consortium for development of cheap, fast charging batteries.

So this all sounds rosy but I wonder:

* There must be a tradeoff right? If LTO is so great why isn't everyone making it?
* Assuming this battery is wonderful, what is Microvast's moat? Do they have significant technological/patent advantages? Why can't Tesla or BYD easily just copy their battery design?
* This company has some good press over the years, but it never really taken off. What was keeping them down?

In comparison, Ford recalled 1.3 mil vehicles from 2014 to 2018 while selling 32.2 mil vehicles in the same time period. Fiat Chrysler also recalled 5.3 mil vehicles made between 2014 and 2018 while logging vehicle sales quantity of more than 400 mil over that period of time. Recall numbers as taken from [https://autoversed.com/the-biggest-automotive-recalls-of-the-past-decade/](https://autoversed.com/the-biggest-automotive-recalls-of-the-past-decade/). This means an average of about 1-4% recall per new vehicle sale.

post,k1qvku,,Key Takeaways from the Airbnb IPO filing,"Hi everyone,

I work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends and tech companies. I put this post together to share some key takeaways I had from looking at Airbnb's S-1 filing. If you found this post valuable and would like to read more please let me know. I'm thinking about writing like this more often if it's something people get value from. Thanks

On Monday November 16th, Airbnb filed to go public. While a target IPO price has not yet been set, Airbnb looks to be aiming to raise about $3 billion dollars at an analyst-estimated valuation of $30 billion. This is up from Airbnb's most recent valuation of $18.1 billion in April of this year when it raised a total of $2 billion in debt to cope with the Covid-19 crisis.

Airbnb is a remarkable company. What started in 2007 as 2 friends renting out airbeds in their apartment to attendees of a conference has, 13 years later, grown into a company operating in 220 countries with over 4 million hosts who have cumulatively earned over $110 billion. In 2019, there were 327 million nights and experiences booked on Airbnb. Nobody could have predicted those numbers in 2007. Airbnb has defined a brand new travel category and become a standard part of our vocabulary, much like Zoom. As they state in their S-1:

>*"" “Airbnb” has become synonymous with one-of-a-kind travel on a global scale.""*

But, while Airbnb is clearly a remarkable company, is it a good investment? That’s the question that this post aims to answer. Here are some key takeaways from an analysis of Airbnb’s recent S-1 filing:

(\****Note:*** *In case you’re wondering, an S-1 is the document that a companies files with the SEC when they plan to go public)*

1. Airbnb is a resilient business

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on Airbnb’s business. Gross booking value (GBV) in March was down 127%. Due to cancellations and alterations, Airbnb actually lost money on bookings in March.",10927,True,1606437131.0,2020-11-27 01:32:11,1607,375,tadhg8811,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/k1qvku/key_takeaways_from_the_airbnb_ipo_filing/,True,0.97,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,k2pk53,,"You've seen 40-80, now here's a comprehensive 60-100 mph list","I should note that these aren't ""true"" 60-100 mph tests. These results are taken from the 0-[end of run] tests from various car magazines. Typically, magazines will run three acceleration tests: 0-60, 0-100, and the quarter mile. All of these data points will come from the same run (or an average of a few runs). 

Thus, the 60-100 time is simply the time it takes to go from 60 mph to 100 mph *while already accelerating*. In my opinion, a ""true"" 60-100 test would have the car cruising at 60 mph in an optimal gear and then goosing it from there. 

Enjoy.

post,k6smc3,,A Semi-Drunk Business Related Question,"Hi guys, 

Am in the middle of watching a documentary and part of it covers a french guy in papua new guinea. This guy had a butchery, cafe and now more importantly has introduced the country to supermarkets and owns over 50% of them. My Question is why cant we being from a wealthier country simply provide some lower wealth nations with essential services which they require on day to day life such as water, supermarket/retail, infrastructure and create business doing that and gain wealth. The Congo for example is the biggest country by mass in Africa and has next to zero tarmac roads although gravel is coveted in the country, there is not a SINGLE company dedicated to using that to create much needed roads for example. What stops us from doing this and creating a company which their government would surely sign a contract and agree given that it is essential and no one else internally is doing it . 

Thinking about it if you save up some money here in the developed world (im from UK) and use that to buy cheaper things over there surely sumn like 100k would make u able to build a hq, ship parts and machinery, as well as employing locals.

Someone need to answer this question bc this french guy got minted from retail and i dont understand what factors would have stopped people previously from providing essential services to poorer nations to gain profit as well as improving their lives.

post,k9d7o2,,Chevy Bolt vs Nissan Leaf vs Rav4 prime vs ID.4 vs Tesla Model 3: winner: Model 3,"This is a **long** winding comparison of a number of electric drive cars. I'm writing it for those who don't want to go to the dealerships, rent cars from Chevy, Turo and borrow cars from friends etc like I have.

TLDR: I am an indecisive overly analytical person. I've been seriously considering the Chevy Bolt, Rav4 prime, ID.4 (only one I haven't driven) and the Tesla Model 3 and *I would consider a model Y if I had that kind of money*. Out of all of them I'm sure the Model 3 (SR or LR) is the best car for me (and many). Also I hate ""Tesla culture"" and fanboyism and don't like Elon. Still Tesla has extraordinary engineering.

First let me say this comparison is from the perspective of what car meets *my* wants and needs best. It is likely to differ from your own. If you need a *pure* point A to point B EV car that's reliable and **inexpensive I'd choose the Bolt EV, Kia Niro EV, or ID.4** for sure. I wouldn't park it in your garage though (more on that later). If the bolt EV had the supercharging speed/network I'd buy it in a heartbeat. My wants and needs however are an enjoyable driving experience, reducing my climate impact, and **getting passengers point A to point B as quickly** as possible (meaning without maintenance as well).

In addition to actually driving and trying to live with each car I've watched 100s of hours on youtube  car reviews, road trips, technology dives etc. I've watched reviews of the Kona EV, Niro EV, and others. I've read EPA documents, and have a literal graduate degree in materials science on battery technology, also working in the field. I've written a small simulation / calculation of travel time based on the cars EPA range, drag coefficients and charging profiles.

**Rav 4 Prime:**

I seriously wanted the Rav 4 prime. Power, Toyota reliability, and EV most of the time? It sounds amazing, my ""highway charge times"" would be 5 min (talk about fast fast charging!).

post,ka99a1,,Unintentionally hate my ICE vehicle after test driving a performance M3,"Tesla is my favorite company in multiple aspects. Their upbringing, mission, groundbreaking products... I just love them so much and have for a few years. 

I’m 20 years old and in college and currently drive a pickup truck that isn’t too speedy, but still can pass cars with a breeze. For the past couple of years I’ve been convincing my parents to purchase a Tesla and we’ve been on 2 test drives. (I was not the driver for either of these trips). 

Under GA law, for some reason I was under the impression that you had to be at least 25+ years of age to test drive a vehicle. After some curiosity, I called a local Tesla showroom and found out you only had to be 18. I shouted from the rooftops after hanging up the phone and immediately booked my test drive as soon as possible. 

A week later, after checking in for my appointment and getting settled, the employee said, “So you’re going to be driving the performance Model 3, I’m sure that’s okay with you?” “Absolutely”. I sat down in the drivers seat and was astonished even though I fully knew what to expect. Due to Covid, employees weren’t riding in the vehicle with you. Instead, they send you on your way for roughly 20 minutes to do your hearts desires. 

After driving for a few minutes and getting used to the braking system (which I absolutely loved) I approached a red light and I was the first car in line. When it turned green, I (safely) tested out the acceleration. I got a head rush, was thrown back in my seat and couldn’t hold back my laughter. I couldn’t believe how fast this machine that I was in charge of could go. I proceeded to get on the freeway and merge with no trouble at all as the acceleration gives you plenty of confidence to get in front of cars. I let autopilot take me a few miles and had it pass cars in lanes, I was smiling the entire time. Couldn’t stop myself no matter how hard I tried.

post,key7ub,,"Proposed Constitutional Challenge for excess EV re-registration fees: ie., in AL, AR, GA, IN, IL, MO, OH, WV, WY, etc.,.","**BACKGROUND**

Texas is considering implementing an EV re-registration fee to replace the revenue lost from gasoline taxes for roads and bridges.  The Texas SB-604 report has a nice break-down of how other states have dealt with the issue on page 35, and is [available here](https://d3eaozktcyljdh.cloudfront.net/cdn/ff/Xr9v-6fz2A5PionA1705nLQIp3cOoS8ZzMRmbAatXG8/1607100255/public/report-files/SB_604_AFV-Report_120120.pdf). Spoiler alert, based on the Texas analysis, the fee replacement should be approximately **$100** a year for EVs and **$80** for hybrids.

Of course, I'd heard about the $200 EV re-registration fees popping up here and there, and I always just thought, ""man, someone really ought to lobby against that..."" and yet, here we are.  There's a bunch of states that now have $150, $200 or more re-registration fees for EVs.

**LEGAL STANDARD**

When I was hearing about these fees in the abstract in other states where I don't live, I was regarding this as what is known as a [""political question""](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/political_question_doctrine) which essentially means, it's up to the legislative process, and courts shouldn't be involved because I was thinking of it as a [nonjusticiable issue](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/justiciability).

Basically, EV owners aren't a [protected class](https://content.next.westlaw.com/5-501-5857?transitionType=Default&contextData). It's a voluntary choice to own an EV -- so rational basis scrutiny applies to the legal examination of laws that disproportionately impact EV owners.

post,kgj5uo,,Can we talk about how BEHIND Canada is on EVs...,"I just wanted to start off by saying how disappointed in Canadians (honestly could apply to americans too, yet they still have better charging infrastructure and cost of vehicules).

I’d love to see if any other developped countries fare worst than Canada in a combination of these 3 factors:
1. Available EV to choose from
2. Charging Infrastructure 
3. Affordability

Here’s the 100% fully electric EVs available to the grand public:
-Hyundai Ioniq starting at 43 835$ 272km

-Hyundai Kona starting at 44 999$ 400km

-Nissan Leaf starting at 46 348$ 242km

-Kia soul starting at 44 505$ 348km

-Kia Niro starting at 46 905$ 385km

-Chevrolet Bolt starting at 47 953$ 400km

-Volkswagen egolf starting at 40 052$ Like 198km

-BMW i3 starting at 53 000$ Idk range but probably a joke for the price

-Tesla model 3 SR+ starting at 52 990$ 400km

-Other tesla models, Porsche, Audi, BMW, Volvo luxury vehicles that are unattainable for most average consumers.


Most of the vehicules offered above are eligible for a 5000$ federal incentive (after taxes). Other than that, only 2 provinces out of 10 have additional incentives (BC 5000$, QC 8000$). This goes to show how Canada cares, imo. 

Now, we could argue that even with rate conversions, prices are incredibly steep compared to Europe, by example, where a 2020 Peugeot costs 19000£ (33 000$) and has around 350km range. A 33 000$ car here with incentives could bring it to par with ICE vehicules.

Right now, the cheapest options have so little range for their price that no wonder canadians (I’d go as far as North Americans) have such a low adoption rates.

The only differences between US and Canada? Scarce charging infrastructure and ... winter. Canadian winters can reduce range up to 40%, on already low average range on available and the more affordable vehicules.

1. If you use your EV as a Daily Driver, and thus for your side hustle, has this made anything difficult for you?

post,knz82h,,Why the $TSLA bubble will not burst?,"A correction (\~-20%) can happen, but the bubble will not burst (where $TSLA loses more than 50%-90% of its value). Here's why:  

So a lot of people often use the dotcom bubble as a parallel to speculate the pop of the Tesla bubble. The most immediate comparisons come from names such as Amazon, which lost nearly 90% of its value from the peak of the bubble but was eventually able to gain back most of its shares. Other comparisons also include stocks such as Yahoo, which was actually added to the S&P 500 in 1999, right before the bubble burst, or even Qualcomm/Cisco. 

These speculations and comparisons are always interesting to think about. They come from deductions, aka where you extrapolate data points from the past in order to predict what is going to happen in the future. However, a deduction is often not the most useful mental model, especially when circumstances are different in the future. And this is one of those cases where the circumstances are actually very different. 

Now the basic argument of ""Tesla is not a car company"" is often overused. Yes, Tesla creates batteries, they are going into the autonomous market soon, their AutoPilot is one of the best AI that the world has today (stronger than NVIDIA's GPUs), they are going to get into the insurance game, they are going to get into the financing industry, some people might even say they are going to collaborate with Space X to create flying cars in 2050. That's all great. However, I'm actually going to argue that despite all of these things, Tesla's current price is overvalued but yet, the stock will not burst. And this has in large part to do with how the markets and trader psychology works today, and how different it is from 1999/2000:

We are currently having a record level of downloads for the Signal app around the world. Between WhatsApp announcing they would be sharing everything with the Facebook mothership and the Apple privacy labels that allowed people to compare us to other popular messengers, it seems like many people are interested in private communication. 

Some quick facts about us: we are an open-sourced nonprofit organization whose mission is to bring private and secure communication to anyone and everyone. One of the reasons we opted for organizing as a nonprofit is that it aligned with our want to create a business model for a technology that wasn’t predicated on the need for personal data in any way. 

As an organization we work very hard to not know anything about you all. There aren’t analytics in the app, we use end to end encryption for everything from your messages and calls/video as well as all your metadata so we have no idea who you talk to or what you talk about.

We are very excited for all the interest and support, but are even more excited to hear from you all. 

We are online now and answering questions for at least the next 3 hours (in between a whole bunch of work stuff). If you are coming to this outside of the time-window don't worry please still leave a question, we will come back on Monday to answer more.

post,kv06or,,Could a wheel-driven car theoretically break the sound barrier? I did some calculations.,"I'm just thinking. Using the formula of force x velocity = power, I think I've figured out how much power the engine would require.

The force needed at that speed would be equal to drag (rolling resistance would be negligible since it's not dependent on speed), which is given by the drag equation. Let's assume a car with a drag coefficient and a frontal cross-section area of a Tesla Model S (the only car I could find this data for quickly).

* Air density is 1.225kg/m\^3
* Velocity is 330m/s
* Drag coefficient is 0.23 (but the drag coefficient is four times higher at Mach 1, so 0.23 x 4)
* Frontal cross-section area is 2.5m\^2

Using the drag equation, this gives about \~154,000 N of force. Multiplied by velocity, 330 m/s, gives us \~51,000,000 Watts (51MW) of power.

51MW \~= 68,000 horsepower. (Mind you, this would be the horsepower needed at the wheels).

I could be wrong about this next part, but seeing as internal combustion engines have a thermodynamic efficiency of 30-40%, I divided the answer by 0.3 to get the required crank horsepower. \~68,000hp/0.3 = \~226,300bhp.

 Tesla has taken delivery of a massive “Giga Press,” which is believed to be the world’s largest casting machine, at Gigafactory Texas.

## Tesla is literally going big on casing

In recent years, Tesla has been focusing on casting technology to produce larger parts of its vehicles in bigger pieces.

We recently reported that Tesla is now producing [the Model Y with one giant rear-underbody ](https://electrek.co/2021/01/11/tesla-starts-production-model-y-massive-single-piece-rear-casting/)that used to be made of 70 parts.

That’s possible due to [Tesla’s first press, which was installed at the Fremont factory](https://electrek.co/2020/09/09/tesla-casting-machine-new-parts-laying-outside-drone-flyover/) and put in operation last year. The machine, nicknamed Giga Press, is the first of its kind and is produced by Idra Group in Italy. It has a clamping force of 55,000 to 61,000 kilonewtons (5,600 to 6,200 tf).

Tesla has introduced another [of those massive machines at Fremont factory in September](https://electrek.co/2020/09/09/tesla-deploying-second-giga-press-machine-fremont-factory/).

Tesla has reportedly ordered many of those machines to deploy at new factories, and now we see one coming to Texas.

Jeff Roberts did a drone flyover of the Tesla Gigafactory Texas near Austin today and spotted Tesla unloading several massive containers from Idra:

[https://youtu.be/tNv\_log3NQU](https://youtu.be/tNv_log3NQU)

The new Giga Press arrives as Tesla is starting to make a lot of progress on its new factory under construction with several structures taking shape over the last few months.

> Many Tesla fans view the electric carmaker as a world leader in self-driving technology. CEO Elon Musk himself has repeatedly claimed that the company is less than two years away from perfecting fully self-driving technology.

> But in an interview with Germany's Manager magazine, Waymo CEO John Krafcik dismissed Tesla as a Waymo competitor and argued that Tesla's current strategy was unlikely to ever produce a fully self-driving system.

> ""For us, Tesla is not a competitor at all,"" Krafcik said. ""We manufacture a completely autonomous driving system. Tesla is an automaker that is developing a really good driver assistance system.""

> For Musk, these two technologies exist along a continuum. His plan is to gradually make Tesla's Autopilot software better until it's good enough to work with no human supervision. But Krafcik argues that's not realistic.

> ""It is a misconception that you can just keep developing a driver assistance system until one day you can magically leap to a fully autonomous driving system,"" Krafcik said. ""In terms of robustness and accuracy, for example, our sensors are orders of magnitude better than what we see on the road from other manufacturers.""

> This isn't a new argument.

> **Tesla keeps missing Musk's predictions**

> Tesla has a lot riding on its efforts to develop fully self-driving technology. Since 2016, Tesla has been selling cars with a suite of cameras, radar, and other hardware that it has touted as ready for full self-driving with a future software update.

post,l5jq8t,,Don't sleep on Lordstown Motors - $RIDE,"Its CEO is Steve Burns, founder of and has a close relationship with fellow American EV company, Workhorse $WKHS. Is an EV company in the United States. Has the ex-director of Tesla. Has the third largest gigafactory in the United States, having taken the reigns of the abandoned Lordstown, Ohio plant GM left to rot just a few years ago. Their main slice of pie is the Lordstown Endurance, an EV pickup truck that already has working prototypes. Press has included having the Endurance parked at the White House and the Endurance being driven by a guy from CNBC. They plan to bring the Endurance to market by end of year/early next year.


The Endurance as of this post has no direct competitor. Its an EV pickup truck marketed to the working class man. Its priced at $52,500 offering 250 mile gas range, tow capability of 6,000lbs. Pre-orders booked at 100,000 as of January 12.

The factory is in full working shape. The company isn't fucking around and fluffing investors. They stated their mission, showed a proof of concept and got to work.

This also brings a story to sell the news on of a destitute American town that GM abandoned and time forgot, being saved by new hard working jobs, crafting top of the line American-made pickup trucks.


This last point gets more bullish with Biden's recent executive order and how much he's proven to be invested in the future of EV. Upon taking a look at the government fleet of vehicles he intends on replacing with EV's, a sizeable portion are pickup trucks. Even disregarding this, the mission is clear to have an EV manufacturer for the USPS. And I'll say this one more time - THERE IS NO DIRECT COMPETITOR TO THE ENDURANCE.

Say what you will about the Cybertruck but its just not a proper candidate for the Endurance's demographic. The Hummer EV is priced at $90k. Ford's at least another year away from the F150 EV.

If one of the following: AMC, Nokia, BlackBerry, and Bed Bath and Beyond stocks short squeeze over the weekend, our traditional beloved value investing will be on its way to becoming obsolete. Even currently, when we think of companies that we should invest in we are told the usual tech company: Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Tesla, and others, when all of them are overvalued. Elon Musk this past summer tweeted that his company, Tesla’s shares were overvalued. Even Apple stock can be considered overvalued, it’s market cap of $2.036T is roughly $350 billion higher than the next two largest tech companies, Amazon and Microsoft (~$1.7T) and until recently (like yesterday) it has not had the sales growth to account for or reflect this market cap. Investors have gotten more optimistic about Apple in the past year, and this exuberance is what allows the stock to continue rising. Even the hedge funds and big tech companies succumb to sentimental investing. I have once said not to “gamble” on stocks and to use only your mind when you make an investment, but that is what we have been conditioned to say. While it has worked out for me and many others, we must not disregard the sentimental value a company holds, or a group of individuals interested in pouring money in the same stock (like Wall Street Bets).",1759,False,1611890169.0,2021-01-29 04:16:09,1,3,Sharp_Profit7321,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/l7hlft/are_we_experiencing_the_end_of_value_investing/,True,1.0,2021,both,search,False,False,0,

post,lae3d4,,"New to investing; trying to make sense of Tesla, and general question about P/E","Hi all,

I'm fairly new to investing. I'm reading some recommended materials; reading A Random Walk Through Wall Street and listening to The Intelligent Investor. I've started trying to read through some earnings reports to learn a bit about the space and how to do my own research.

Some stocks of interest to me are the auto stocks; Toyota and Tesla to be precise.

My understanding is that the P/E is the price over earnings. This number doesn't seem to be handed out per stock. Some seem to automatically calculate it? How is this done? For instance if I google ""Tesla stock"" I get the P/E value of 1318. 

If I google ATT (T) I don't get a P/E value, which I assume means I need to calculate it myself from their earnings reports?

Also, playing with the numbers and trying to figure out how Tesla (a $730B market cap company) stands up next to Toyota (A $227B market cap company) I came up with the following:

    $835 / earnings = 1318.42
    earnings = $835/1318, which would be $0.63 per share (TSLA)

This is interesting to me. Because if we do the same for Toyota:

    $140.49 / earnings = 14.56
    earnings = $140.49 / 14.56 = $9.65 earnings per share (TM)

More interestingly, if I try and apply the PE of TSLA to Toyota, I get the following:

    1318 = price / $9.65 earnings per share
    1318 * $9.65 = price
    price = $12718.7

This would bring Toyota's market cap to $20.6T, which I think we probably all agree would be ridiculous?

The more interesting thing is I took Toyota's P/E and applied it to TSLA

    14.56 = price / $0.63 earnings per share
    price = $9.17

This would bring Tesla's market cap to $8.7B if my math is right. 

I guess the point of my post is to ask, what gives? Are PE values in excess of 1000 for large-cap companies ever justified? Speculatively, is this sustainable? Who is this value coming from?",4281,True,1612213466.0,2021-02-01 22:04:26,93,205,QuarksAreUnbreakable,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lae3d4/new_to_investing_trying_to_make_sense_of_tesla/,True,0.9,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,lc0rzo,,Drone Delivery Canada * $TAKOF * DD [10X UPSIDE],"Drone Delivery Canada Corp. is a drone technology company focused on the design, development, and implementation of its proprietary logistics software platform, using drones. The Company’s platform will be used as a Software as a Service (SaaS) model for government and corporate organizations globally

&#x200B;

Drone tech is really hot sector right now and I feel this is immensely under valued. I am not going to make this post a long one, rather I will just list things good about this company.

&#x200B;

* As I mentioned earlier drone industry is hot atm, look at UAVS, ALPP or BANT
* As part of the Company's technology roadmap, it plans to integrate various aspects of AI into its solution, including the use of AI in leveraging.
* Relaxed regulations for drone parcel delivery to take effect in March!
* The Company has created one of the healthiest balance sheets I've seen in a long time
* Included in 'OTC Markets Group Announces the 2021 OTCQX Best 50' awards.
* Currently trading around $1.1
* Todays volume has been a record.
* $0 DEBT!
* $20 million dollars in the bank.
* WSS has a price target of $6.5
* Undervalued 77%!

&#x200B;

The list really goes on and on I will list all the refs for relevant info for you to look at, but one of the major news recently is that:

* **The Company is in discussions with various Federal and Provincial Government agencies and Canadian logistics providers and is hopeful to commercially participate with its advanced, patented drone delivery as the vaccine distribution plans start to roll out across Canada, and potentially internationally.**

I personally think this is HUGE!

CONS:

* Earnings have declined by 39.6% per year over past 5 years.
* Makes less than USD$1m in revenue (CA$63K).

post,lcftzc,,10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.

post,ling8b,,"Why Cathie Wood might be right, and why TSLA is actually STILL fairly or even undervalued at these levels.","""Analysts have been calling the stock “overvalued” since the day they went public, because they all keep comparing it to other car companies. I wish I had a dollar for every analyst who pointed out how “*every other car company sells ten times as many cars*”. 

 I’ve also repeatedly bumped into some lazy analysis that Tesla is expensive because its current P/E is 1,270x or forward P/E is 204x. However, I’ve hardly ever seen a Tesla bear put out a detailed valuation in support of their bearish thesis which makes me wonder if a lot of people are simply dismissing Tesla in arrogance.

But the thing is, they’re all making the same mistake:

**Tesla isn’t a car company.**

They’re an energy and technology and SaaS company that makes cars.

Once you realize what Tesla really is, you start to see what their place in the market is going to be in the years to come.

They acquired Grohmann Engineering. They acquired Perbox. They acquired Maxwell Technologies and Hibar Systems. And of course everyone remembers the Solar City acquisition back before dropping Motors from their name. They didn’t acquire these companies because they thought they were cool. They did it so nobody else could.

* There are 25,000 EV charging stations in the United States. 20,000 of them are owned by Tesla.
* Tesla is currently the #1 li-ion battery manufacturer in America, and #5 in the world.
* Tesla has secured the rights to large supplies of lithium, and has developed their own internal process for extracting lithium deposits inexpensively from other sources.

These segments of the energy space — battery production and EV charging — are a market sector that’s going to grow 50 fold in the next 15 years as consumer demand for EV’s increases. All of the major auto manufacturers have declared they’re shifting towards electric cars.

Where are they going to get the batteries? How are their customers going to charge them?

Russia is still an almost white spot for Tesla. There is of course a strong Tesla community, but it is small.

Right now, there is for example no map data in Russia for Tesla cars. Not good when you pass the border from the EU and the map screens turns blank. (Elon, please help. Get it changed in the software, so that we can drive to other countries from the EU.)

There are of course almost no superchargers in Russia and Kazakhstan. But there are a few, thanks Tesla !

(a set of 4 Superchargers in the Moscow area and in KZ in Nur Sultan 6x and Almaty 4x)

Kazakhstan is a differen country, but belongs to the russian economic region of 4 countries.

There is a russian law, that **every** ! gas station must have a electric charging possibility. But might be only a 220V outlet. So this is a good beginning.

So what could it be, they want to talk about. Hyundai for example has a car production in Russia and there are other car plants as well in Russia. Hyundai is producing a lot of cars there and the brand is very popular in Russia.

After India, this would be the right place to start a new factory. The new factory could be in Sankt Petersburg or somewhere else.

*“Furthermore, a truly conservative investor will be satisfied with the gains shown on half his portfolio in a rising market, while in a severe decline he may derive much solace from reflecting how much better off he is than many of his more venturesome friends.” – quote from Benjamin Graham*

A conservative investor may have 50% of his or her portfolio in risky assets like stocks and real estate and 50% in less risky investments like US treasury bonds (which you can buy either directly from the US Treasury or through ETFs like Charles Schwab Short Term Treasuries ETF (Ticker: SCHO) as well as through investments in gold (SPDR Gold Trust (Ticker: GLD)) which tends to be a good portfolio hedge against volatile markets and inflation (at least historically).

Silver, though considered a partial monetary metal, is only going to see increased demand from batteries, solar, EV, medical equipment from here on out.

This is a long topic in itself, but the silver price along with gold price has been ""managed"" for years, with banks like JPM being fined millions of dollars for spoofing (creating massive sells using paper futures triggering cascade of sell stops during thin volume trading hours). However as supply becomes tighter the COMEX is increasingly being used as a method for private family offices, mints, industrials, and hedgefunds to take delivery. The situation is quite dire IMO after the recent ""silversqueeze"" movement- Currently there are about 700 million ounces worth of open contract, with 4 days until March delivery. This number is historically high, and even a small percentage of these contracts standing for delivery (i.e by mints and ETF etc who are feeling the demand) would lead to price volatility.

\- Monetary metal. Due to its extreme utility it can be considered the Etherium or theta to gold, but it is nevertheless still store of value, even though it is not a tier I asset for central banks yet. While gold experiences short term head wind due to rising bond yields, a FED yield curve control policy would dramatically increase tail winds for gold. If history serves, gold and silver have a deep connection and a true commodities bull market is often marked by high gold prices. 

\- Unlike gold, silver has no direct competitor, perceived or actual.

post,lq0p2b,,Tesla Dip - discussion thread,"So Tesla was caught in the eye of the storm today, dropping nearly 10% in the midst of this market correction. May also have to do with the company stopping orders for the Model Y. May also be a short term correction as people take profits from the ATH.

For all those on the sidelines who watched the price go up in the last few months and not get in - myself included - what do you say about it’s current price? Still overvalued in your opinion? Are you waiting until the price drops more? Are you buying small to average down if it goes further?

I had been one of those sceptics who thought Tesla was in a bubble and would eventually return to around $500-600. However I must admit after lots of research Tesla does seem to be 5 years ahead of other EV makers and i’ve been waiting ever since to see a price drop.

Does this drop in price justify buying a position in Tesla or are you expecting a bigger drop?

post,lv4gkp,,Startups in 13 sentence - Paul Graham," 

Paul Graham wrote an essay in 2009, ""Startups in 13 sentences""

It's filled with nuggets of startup wisdom like:

""It's better to make a few people really happy than to make a lot of people semi-happy.""

A summary of an already short-essay:

**1. Pick good cofounders.**

Cofounders are for a startup what location is for real estate.

You can change anything about a house except where it is.

In a startup, you can change your idea easily, but changing your cofounders is hard.

**2. Launch fast.**

The reason to launch fast is not so much that it's critical to get your product to market early, but that you haven't really started working on it till you've launched.

Launching teaches you what you should have been building.

**3. Let your idea evolve.**

This is the second half of launching fast. Launch fast and iterate.

It's a big mistake to treat a startup as if it were merely a matter of implementing some brilliant initial idea.

As in an essay, most of the ideas appear in the implementation.

**4. Understand your users.**

You can envision the wealth created by a startup as a rectangle, where one side is the number of users and the other is how much you improve their lives.

The second dimension is the one you have the most control over.

The growth in the first will be driven by how well you do in the second.

The hard part is seeing something new that users lack. The better you understand them the better the odds of doing that.

That's why so many successful startups make something the founders needed

**5. Better to make a few users love you than a lot ambivalent.**

Ideally, you want to make large numbers of users love you, but you can't expect to hit that right away.

Initially, you have to choose between satisfying all the needs of a subset of potential users, or satisfying a subset of the needs of all potential users.

Take the first. It's easier to expand user-wise than satisfaction.

And perhaps more importantly, it's harder to lie to yourself.",6076,True,1614589339.0,2021-03-01 10:02:19,1,0,karen_vardanian,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/lv4gkp/startups_in_13_sentence_paul_graham/,True,1.0,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

However, there's one thing missing from all this. What usually happens in a market when demand outstrips supply? More demand equals Tesla can sell the cars for much more, thus helping Tesla's bottom line. Doesn't have to be Apple prices, but they can add on at least another 20-50%.

post,m01wde,,The Best 2021 Volvo S60 is Underpriced,"Here’s the scenario: you’re interested in getting a compact luxury sports sedan, and you’re thinking about treating yourself to something that’s really quite nice. The usual Teutonic names come into play here: Mercedes, Audi, BMW, along with some others: Tesla, Genesis, etc. And then you think about looking into Volvo’s offerings - which you end up getting, because it’s so terribly mispriced compared to the competition.

Here’s a bunch of MSRPs (which, I know, isn’t what people will actually pay at the dealer, but nonetheless is a solid benchmark) for mostly-comparably-equipped sedans: all wheel drive, a heads-up display, automated parking, traffic-aware cruise control, a sunroof, and whatever free seats/paint color/wheels were available. You might have different preferences than I do, so the numbers might vary person-to-person.

* Volvo’s S60 Recharge Inscription is basically the best S60 you can buy. It comes standard with basically everything, to the point where the only option worth adding (at least, for someone living in Texas) is the $200 automatic parking feature. MSRP + Destination comes out to $51,895, for a 400-horsepower plug-in hybrid with AWD. It also comes with a tax credit of $5,419, making the “actual” price $46,476 (for those who qualify, and I assume most people buying these kinds of products qualify).
* Genesis’ G70 3.3T AWD came to $49,225. It lacked the heads-up display, but was otherwise well-equipped and easily one of the higher-value plays available.
* Tesla’s Model 3 Long Range AWD was $47,190. There aren’t many options available, but it’s easily the most tech-focused product, which causes some polarization among shoppers.
* Audi’s A4 Prestige 45 TFSI quattro S tronic (what a mouthful!) also comes equipped well without having to select options, so it tips the scales at $50,845. The A4 has 261 HP, so about 35% less power to show off four rings.

Air Canada AC.TO - Pre Covid was trading for about $50 a share, however, they also purchased AirTransat for about a 10th of what they should have. Post Covid, I fully expect this stock to go anywhere from $70-$100 CAD a share

Ovintiv OVV - Pre Covid was trading for $60 a share, They tanked to about $5 a share when Covid started and have been consistently on the rebound, bouncing back to almost $30 a share. I expect it to go back to normal levels within the next year.

Cenovus Energy [CVE.TO](https://cve.to/) \- Pre Covid was trading for anywhere from $30-$50 a share. As of right now it's trading at $10.57. With the purchase of Husky Energy. Again I expect this stock to likely go to $50 a share within the next year or two.

H2O Innovations Inc HEO.V - This is an upcoming company with solid financials that is sort of treading new ground. Their stock just took a dip and is starting to recover. With the need for clean water and company foundations, I'd expect this stock to hover around $5 a share when things get back to normal.

Cineplex Inc [CGX.TO](https://cgx.to/) \- Everyone seems to be going crazy for AMC right now, along with the Gamestop situation. But, the theater company with the better financials and less risk is Cineplex, not only are they in a better position when everything fully opens back up to have a huge bounce back but they pay a better dividend as well.

FSD Pharma [HUGE.CN](https://huge.cn/) \- Pot company that is building massive facilities and expanding as quite a high rate. As Pot becomes legal in more places, they will continue to grow.

Supreme Cannabis FIRE.V - Another pot company that is expanding quite a bit and with the same concept as [HUGE.CN](https://huge.cn/), will continue to grow as it becomes more legal.... Just keep in mind it's a volatile market.

Tesla operates their “Gigafactory”, a lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle subassembly factory in Sparks. Nevada has the only mine producing lithium in the U.S., called the “Lithium Hub”, located near the Tesla Gigafactory facility. ""

Finished goods to Fremont would benefit.

> # 1. Stock futures mixed after Dow, S&P 500 closed at record highs again

> * U.S. stock futures were mixed Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 little changed after they both closed again at record highs to start the week. Nasdaq futures rose Tuesday, adding to Monday’s 1.1% gain, which moved the tech-heavy index to just 4.5% away from last month’s record high close.

> * Stocks were able to shake off the 10-year Treasury yield holding around 1.6% on Monday and Tuesday, after hitting an over one-year high of 1.642% on Friday. Rapidly rising bond yields have recently been a drag on growth stocks as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and compress market valuations.

> # 2. Fed to begin March meeting with polices under scrutiny

> * The Federal Reserve, which begins its two-day March meeting Tuesday, will be watching bond yields and the latest reading on retail sales. Economists expect the government’s February data to show a 0.4% increase in retail sales following a 5.3% surge in January. With the Fed’s extraordinarily easy monetary measures during Covid under scrutiny, the nation’s central bank is set to release new economic and interest rate forecasts along with its policy statement Wednesday afternoon.

post,metref,,[$BB] The size of the real-world driving datasets that Blackberry IVY has access to will be so much bigger than Tesla's,"A huge reason for Tesla's insane valuation is the fact that Tesla has amassed 3 billion miles of real-world Autopilot data (by comparison, Waymo only has 20 million real-world miles and 10 billion simulation miles). This allows Tesla to be the only automotive company currently that can train vision-based self-driving system in the real world at such a huge scale. Essentially, Tesla is utilizing its users as free labor to train its self-driving system by having the users correct the system whenever it makes a wrong turn.

Blackberry IVY will very soon change the game. By creating a standard data abstraction layer on the 175 million QNX-powered vehicles (and possibly more since IVY is OS-agnostic and will support other non-QNX vehicles), Blackberry IVY will likely become the de-facto industry standard for automakers to share normalized sensor data (camera, radar, lidar, steering wheel rotation, brakes, acceleration etc.) with Autonomous Vehicle software makers (Waymo, Cruise, Argo, Motional, Aurora, TuSimple, Baidu, Pony.AI, Momenta etc.).

By 'sharing', I mean monetizing. De-identified vehicle sensor and localization data will be the most important asset that automakers can monetize in the immediate short term.

post,mg91ws,,Tesla and Toyota Are Considering Jointly Developing a Small Electric SUV Platform,"Choi Won-seok reports in the Korean Ghosun Libo news publication that according to an official from the Japanese automotive industry Toyota and Tesla have been reviewing the partnership since last year and are approaching the final stage.

Here are some of the highlights of Toyota Tesla partnership. When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV EV at low cost using the Toyota platform.

The Ghosun IIbo is the biggest newspaper in SK. A Tesla source Sawyer Merritt, tweets that he has been told ""the reporter of the story is also highly regarded. We'll see if it's true.""

Toyota provides the vehicle platform to Tesla, and instead, Tesla provides some of the electronic control platform and software technology installed in its vehicle to Toyota.

When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV electric vehicle at low cost using the Toyota platform. In addition, Tesla's sales in Japan, which are around 1,000 units per year, are likely to increase significantly.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said at the 'Battery Day' in September of last year, that Tesla ""will release a $25,000 compact and affordable electric car in 2023. However, among experts, there were several opinions that it would be difficult for Tesla to find a way to sell electric cars at such low prices. Especially considering Tesla has already developed the Model 3 in 2017, The model electric crossover in 2020, the exoskeleton of the Cybertruck and working on the Semi truck. at this moment we have no idea about Tesla's affordable compact vehicle, which now it looks like may be produced in partnership with Toyota, if this report is true.

I think this is a smart move for both Tesla and Toyota. Some people may be skeptical of a Tesla Toyota partnership, but remember that Tesla helped built Toyota RAV4 in 2012. I am sure you guys remember when Toyota sold its Tesla stocks in 2017.

I have two degrees, accounting and business analytics. Pursuing work in data analysis, which has proven to be challenging without a CS degree. I know that I like working with large sets of data, but not exactly trying to achieve the title of “data scientist”. Regardless, Im having zero luck in my applications. Zero.

More than almost anyone on my team. 

But if you know how banks work, then you know that being straightforward and hardworking can be a recipe for disaster. They want someone who knows how to “act”. And they dont care if that person is a lazy alcoholic shit head.

**Title:** ""Germany misses climate protection targets"" - Tesla writes fire letter after problems surrounding Gigafactory in Grünheide.

**Abstract:** Elon Musk's company is calling for priority approval for energy transition projects in Germany. Also because of bad experiences with the Gigafactory. By Thorsten Metzner .

Six months before the federal election, the Tesla Group led by Elon Musk is calling for a fundamental reform of the licensing law in Germany - with priority given to sustainable energy transition projects. This is the conclusion of an incendiary letter from Tesla, which is available to this newspaper, and which is also justified by the concrete experiences with the Gigafactory for Berlin-Brandenburg (GFBB) in Grünheide, Brandenburg, which was launched in November 2019 and has not yet been approved.

The plant is actually scheduled to start production in July 2021. ""Tesla Brandenburg has experienced first-hand that obstacles in German licensing law slow down the necessary industrial transformation and thus the transport and energy turnaround,"" the official letter says. State and federal politicians had promised all possible support for the Gigafactory. Nevertheless, according to research by this newspaper, the planned start of production is in danger, also because the main permit is still open.",9100,True,1617871967.0,2021-04-08 10:52:47,864,100,DarmokAndJaladAtTana,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/mmnl5i/tesla_writes_letter_to_to_the_higher/,True,0.96,2021,both,search,False,False,0,

* Following 500,000 miles of development testing, Ford embarked on a  110,000-mile “Mother of All Road Trips” across the United States and  Canada to prove out BlueCruise hands-free highway driving technology in a  wide range of driving and weather conditions
* 2021 Ford F-150 and 2021 Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with the available Ford Co-Pilot360™ Active 2.0 Prep Package can receive BlueCruise later this year through over-the-air software update.    
 
* BlueCruise will give drivers the comfort and confidence of  hands-free driving on prequalified sections of divided highways called  Hands-Free Blue Zones that make up more than 100,000 miles of North  American roads  
 
* Additional Ford vehicles to receive BlueCruise technology in coming  years as Ford continues to add additional highways and deliver new  hands-free driving capabilities to F-150, Mustang Mach-E and more

**DEARBORN, Mich., April 14, 2021** – Ford will begin offering its  new BlueCruise hands-free highway driving system to customers later  this year after 500,000 miles of development testing and fine-tuning the  technology on a journey across the United States and Canada.

Last year, Ford sent a fleet of 10 test vehicles – five F-150 pickups  and five all-electric Mustang Mach-E SUVs – to complete what test  drivers dubbed the “Mother of All Road Trips.” The trek covered more  than 110,000 miles through 37 states and five Canadian provinces to  challenge BlueCruise against a wide range of road, weather and traffic  conditions.

Hoping to hear some helpful feedback.

Quick disclaimer: I am not a CFA, I don't have a degree in finance (degree in engineering) and this is my first time trying to do this. Obviously don't take this as investment advice.

For the base case scenario, I used analyst estimates for revenue growth in 2021-2023 and then grew it at the rate closer to the projected EV market growth between now and 2027 (22%). I then grew it at 20% for the last 3 years to be conservative. So this is a scenario in which Tesla captures more market share for a few years and then maintains that market share. For EBITDA Margin, I maintained it at 20% until 2026 at which point I let it decline by 1 percentage point a year as I'd expect there to be more competition and Tesla to be selling less luxury cars (higher margin) as a percentage of their sales. 

My base case EBITDA projection for 2030 was then 48.45 Billion USD.

For the bull/optimistic case, I kept the margin at 20% for the next 10 years and kept the growth rate above the 22% market rate for the next 10 years, meaning Tesla is able to maintain their higher than industry margins, perhaps through leasing autopilot software and continues to gain market share.

**What is Coinbase?**

* Founded in 2012, Coinbase is mainly known as a company that allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies regardless if you’re an everyday investor or a hedge fund
* The company serves 43 million retail users, 7,000 institutions like hedge funds, and 115,000 ecosystem partners in over 100 countries
* **On the retail side,** Coinbase’s main products are its mobile app which has a super easy to use interface and then there’s Coinbase Pro which is more for advanced traders
* **On the business side,** Coinbase also offers a lot of really interesting services, including trading for institutions, listing assets on Coinbase which probably comes at a high cost, enabling businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments, cryptocurrency custody which just means helping institutions store crypto assets securely, and a venture capital arm that invests in crypto startups
* **Main point:** Coinbase is much more than just a place to trade crypto and the company is creating an ecosystem where different parts of the business feed off each other to make the entire platform stronger

If an electric car was to be caught in a multi-car pile up, how would it fare compared to gas cars? I know electric cars are really good in crash tests, but that's only in one accident. What happens if the vehicle's structure is already compromised and then you get an 18-wheeler barreling into it at over 60 mph smashing it into everything else? If Trey McDaniel was in a Model X or Mach E and it got ejected into the next lane over, that seems like a best case scenario should it burst into flames. How will you get enough water to drown the batteries and keep them from reigniting if the car is now in the middle of the group (assuming fire fighters can get to the scene early and close enough)?

I'm based in NZ and use Hatch Invest.

Right now I own a mish mash of stocks, ranging from Apple to Sony to Baba, to VACQ.

I'd like to set my portfolio on somewhat autopilot, with 10-20% for speculative plays (I want to keep my VACQ for eg). I'm bullish on certain plays, and I enjoy the personal picks aspect.

I'm only a few thousand into investing so far, and only put in a couple hundred a month, so now seems like the ideal time to rebalance before moving forward.

So I'm looking at one of the following options, and would love suggestions or reasoning on ratios and combinations:

Option 1:
40% VOO
20% VXF
20% VXUS
20% personal picks

Option 2:

I would bet this is not related to any government permission delay or problems in construction.

It is related with the new batteries. Since the new batteries are not yet ready it doesn't make sense to push the factory. Tesla will use the extra 6 months to built the battery factory so all pieces will be in place in order to produce a German made Tesla.

Years ago I bought Ford as a value play, back then it appeared undervalued and had a solid dividend for the sector. I feel like Fords F-150 alone is enough to justify owning the stock. Then the pandemic happened, then the chip shortage happened and I have remained patient. 

Now that patience has been rewarded, I keep looking at TSLA and F and wonder why they don't get together. With Ford's diverse product lineup, aggressive move into the EV market and projections of profitability, I think they represent a significant value. I know they are hampered by huge legacy costs, but in todays inflationary environment, I believe those costs are mitigated.  

TSLA is losing market share and their shiny new offering (the cybertruck) is still a long way off. Yet TSLA still has nearly 10x the market cap of Ford. This makes me wonder if TSLA would look to pick off a potential competitor in the EV market, expand their products offerings and create a big splash all at once.",1002,False,1622741927.0,2021-06-03 19:38:47,0,19,3nnui,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nrj6n5/would_tesla_ever_consider_acquiring_ford/,True,0.29,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

The other news is TSLA opens for business in China. Not sure that is good news for the US but since when does Musk give a shite about America. 

That's probably where where 5x trading volume and $100million dump into TSLA came from today. The Chinese.

Expect the price to decay back to trend over next trading week.

But it's bullishness is up for the day. So could be a shift in sentiment.

post,o6z52n,,Helped my mother finally get her dream Ford Mustang. (Mach-E),"(Apologies for the long-winded story.)

My mom has been a consistent four door sedan owner for the entirety of my life and has been very anti-SUV/crossover.  There were more Ford Tauruses in her ownership history than either of us could remember.  Her last sedan was a 2016 Volvo S60, and she enjoyed that well enough, but she often complained about how low it was.  With age starting to get to her knees, she started talking a lot more about SUVs and ease of entry/exit in the last few years, and especially in the last few months.

We started looking seriously at things in the past month or so.  She was really keen on the idea of a plug-in hybrid, but unfortunately the market where we live is virtually non-existent.  I don't think there's really been a PHEV sold regularly here since the Volt (which I had), and never a small SUV/crossover.  I looked around and pretty much everything came up 250-500 or more miles away, just way outside the feasible range for her to look at.  There was one random Rav4 Prime around that I don't know why or how a dealer here has it, but they also had it marked up $6k, so it was out.  She liked the idea of a full BEV as well, but it still made her a bit nervous, despite being around them for about 6 years between the Teslas my brother, and I have owned.  The Model Y was out of her price range by about $10k, give or take, and she never was fully comfortable with the interfaces and such in our Teslas, so I just knew it wouldn't be a good fit for her anyway.  It seemed like either a plain hybrid or the standard ICE variant of something like an Escape or CR-V was probably going to be in her future just due to what we could find.

However, my dad and I did have one other electric option left we were pursuing in our search for her, availability was just a huge issue.  I had talked to her about the Mach-E a lot from when it was first announced, because I knew it would be right up her alley.",7717,True,1624534798.0,2021-06-24 13:39:58,43,35,Algeradd,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/o6z52n/helped_my_mother_finally_get_her_dream_ford/,True,0.69,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,ohoh4i,,The Physics of 0-60 mph in 2 Seconds (Model S Plaid),"I was looking into the physics of the Tesla Model S Plaid's performance numbers in response to the [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/o1vziw/tesla_model_s_plaid_first_test_060_mph_in_198/) and [debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/mdz8t8/tesla_is_lying_the_model_s_plaid_wont_be_able_to/) going on in r/cars but I thought you all would find this insightful too. Tesla's claims of 0-60 mph in 1.99 seconds, 1/4 mile in 9.23s @ 155 mph are all very impressive and seemingly defying the laws of physics. No worries though, I built a physics-based model for performance EVs, plugged in the Model S Plaid, and confirmed the universe is still in order.

Let's start with some interesting takeaways from the model first and I'll go into detail on the physics and how it was built later on.

# Model S Plaid is built for 0-60 in 2 seconds

Modern EV motors all have a similarly shaped power curve that have a constant torque region (lower speeds) and a constant power region (higher speeds). **Peak acceleration occurs in the constant torque region** and acceleration is constant until you hit the ""corner speed"" and transition into the constant power region where torque drops off.

The power curve of the Model S Plaid has just the right shape (and peak power/torque) to reach 60 mph in 2 seconds (excluding a 1ft rollout). As evidence, the **Model S Plaid has a corner speed of exactly 60 mph** (ie. 1050 ft-lb is 1020 hp at a vehicle speed of 60 mph). This allows it to pull a constant \~1.25 g's all the way up to 60 mph, which falls off immediately after ([plot](https://imgur.com/14Jz5NP)).

To get to 60 mph even faster, the Model S Plaid would need to have even more torque (and probably more traction). Just **having more power wouldn't yield 0-60 improvements as the Model S Plaid** **is already in its constant torque region all the way up to 60 mph**.",11872,True,1625943067.0,2021-07-10 20:51:07,10,16,jayqwu,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/ohoh4i/the_physics_of_060_mph_in_2_seconds_model_s_plaid/,True,0.59,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,op5vs8,,Option to Co-Own My Job,"Hey everyone!

I (22M) am a full time self defense instructor. The studio I'm a part of is a newer studio, but I've been trained by/teaching with the owner at our original school where I started almost 7 years ago.

I've taught with this studio since before it was a brick and mortar location. Right now I'm just an instructor, but I also help plan events and seminars (which she compensates me for my time as well as mileage to the studio).

Since the studio's doing well, my boss (the owner of the studio) wants to move both of us to salary which would come with increased responsibilities. Since this is my full time job, I don't mind more responsibilities.

I also have the option to buy shares in the studio and we've talked about co-owning. I trust her, I believe in the studio, and we've had some awesome growth. She actively participates in networking meetings as well as business coaching and implements them to the benefit of the business. Thoughts or advice?

post,opz2fg,,"The Upcoming Electric Horsepower Wars (AKA, why 2,000+ horsepower is easy)","Let  just get the obvious out of the way. Electric cars are EASY to build.  Like, stupid easy, at least compared to ICE cars. Why? Moving parts and  fluid dynamics are a bitch (think engines, air/fuel systems,  transmissions). These issues are mostly bypassed by going electric. Need  more power; get a bigger battery and/or have it discharge more.  Electric motors are a joke to build compared to ICE engines. Electric  cars (mostly) have a single gear, so you don't need a super complex 8  speed automatic that's super difficult to build and is pretty fragile  compared to a single reduction gear. These are the basic differences.  The downside, for now, is that batteries are heavy and cost too much,  something that will be drastically reduced in the near future with more  R&D, economies of scale, and government incentives.

Now,  because electric cars are easy to build, you will see a crap ton of new  car manufactures spring up (think Tesla and Rimac). The old car  companies could easily crush them if they wanted, but they won't. Why?  Vested interest. They spent way too much money on existing ICE cars to  suddenly just scrap their factories and start fresh, so instead they  will SLOWLY transition to the electric car age, to please their  stockholders, which are notoriously risk-adverse. Anyway, where am I  going with this? Electric cars are easy, at least their drivetrains are.  Fit and finish, luxury options, high-tech options are hard to do, and  require long logistics chains as well as R&D. This is why Teslas are  crap when it comes to luxury or techy options, compared to a Mercedes  or Audi. So, how do you sell an electric car for 100k that has crap  range, few options and features and handles like crap because it weights  69 tons? You make it quick (not fast).

If you want to continue the discussion in this thread, I suggest sorting by new. 

Posted below on Saturday.

This sub has been very quiet about discussing Tesla lately it seems. Just getting a status update on what everyone thinks may happen this quarter and in the future.

Just to throw some possibilities around, here are some discussion points. 

What do you expect this quarter? Will it be enough to push Tesla back above $700?

Will having Bitcoin on the balance sheet have an effect on their quarter? It's dropped some but not that much. It will be  slightly negative this quarter, but could bounce back again if Bitcoin runs again.

How do you think the stock will react if Tesla rolls out Full self driving that can drive people to work? The new subscription model is out, so FSDAAS is now an option, how does that effect their revenue next quarter and long term? How soon do you think FSD rolls out to wide release? It's already looking very impressive, but still needs some fine tuning. Will it be v10 or v11 that is capable? Is the processor enough to handle level 4 driving? What will be needed for level 5 FSD? 

How soon will the Austin and Berlin plants open up to production? Are they duplicating problem solving of the 4680 Model Y line between Texas and Germany? Who is farther along? Is Berlin almost ready to go and just delayed by permit processes? Will the new factories be covered in solar panels?

What is the going forward plans for letting other auto manufacturers use the Tesla charging network? Elon just mentioned Tesla will allow other EV's to use their network. Will all new chargers be pass through with 300kwh charging? That will be needed for the cybertruck. How big will their charging network need to grow, and how will that effect their revenue?",4147,True,1627142161.0,2021-07-24 17:56:01,332,479,rideincircles,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oqsosi/what_do_you_expect_for_tslas_2nd_quarter_update/,True,0.88,2021,both,search,False,False,0,

post,os7kvx,,Tesla 2021 Q2 earnings report,"Tesla 2021 Q2 Earnings Report

Earnings: $1.45 vs. $0.98 per share expected
Revenue: $11.98 vs. $11.30 billion expected
Free cash flow: 619 million vs. -319 million expected
 
Cash
 • Operating cash flow less capex (free cash flow) of $619M in Q2
 • Net debt and finance lease repayments of $1.6B in Q2
 • In total, $912M decrease in our cash and cash equivalents in Q2 to $16.2B
Profitability
 • $1.3B GAAP operating income; 11.0% operating margin in Q2
 • $1.1B GAAP net income; $1.6B non-GAAP net income (ex-SBC1) in Q2
 • 28.4% GAAP Automotive gross margin (25.8% ex-credits) in Q2
Operations
 • Record vehicle production and deliveries in Q2
 • Successful launch of FSD subscription in July
 • Started delivering the new Model S to customers
 
Summary
In the second quarter of 2021, we broke new and notable records. We produced and delivered over 200,000 vehicles, achieved an operating margin of 11.0% and exceeded $1B of GAAP net income for the first time in our history.
Supply chain challenges, in particular global semiconductor shortages and port congestion, continued to be present in Q2. The Tesla team, including supply chain, software development and our factories, worked extremely hard to keep production running as close to full capacity as possible. With global vehicle demand at record levels, component supply will have a strong influence on the rate of our delivery growth for the rest of this year.
We successfully launched Tesla Vision in Q2, which was mainly possible due to our ability to use data from over a million Tesla vehicles to source a large, diverse and accurate dataset. Solving full autonomy is a difficult engineering challenge in which we continue to believe can only be solved through the collection of large, real-world datasets and cuttingedge AI.

post,oy3v9z,,Tesla AI day scheduled for August 19th.,"With AI Day approaching in a few weeks, Tesla has started sending out invitations to the highly-anticipated event. Tesla’s invitations, including the wording in its RSVP page, suggest that the company may be discussing some interesting topics for AI Day. 

Immediately noticeable in the AI Day invites is an image showing what seems to be a [**stack of computer hardware**](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-dojo-chip-images-dennis-hong/). Very little is known about this yet-to-be-announced hardware, though it was initially teased by legendary mechanical engineer Dennis Hong online. This fueled speculations that the image was likely related to Tesla’s Dojo Supercomputer, which would be used to train Autopilot software. 

A look at the RSVP page for the event shows a rather interesting description of the upcoming event. 

*“Join us in Palo Alto, CA on August 19, 2021, at 5 p.m. PDT. This invite-only event will feature a keynote by Elon, hardware and software demos from Tesla engineers, test rides in Model S Plaid, and more. Attendees will be among the first to see our latest developments in supercomputing and neural network training. They’ll also get an inside look at what’s next for AI at Tesla beyond our vehicle fleet.*

*“If you have received an email invitation for this event, please submit the form below using the same email address to let us know you’d like to attend. Space is limited, and we will be confirming the attendee list closer to the event date. If you are chosen to attend AI Day, you will receive an email confirmation with additional event details.”*

Arguably the most noticeable portion from AI Day’s RSVP page is the sentence referencing what is “next for AI at Tesla beyond our vehicle fleet.” Granted, Tesla is also using its software prowess for its energy products with products like Autobidder, but Elon Musk has also noted in the past that long term, people would likely think of Tesla as an [**AI robotics company**](https://www.thestreet.",2610,True,1628115734.0,2021-08-05 00:22:14,20,11,redmars1234,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oy3v9z/tesla_ai_day_scheduled_for_august_19th/,True,0.7,2021,both,search,False,False,0,

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

* COIN
* TSLA
* HOOD
* DKNG
* NVTA

Gapping DOWN:

* AXSM
* OXY
* FANG
* WYNN
* DLTR

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking at a somewhat mixed open after we saw the indices push for new ATH to end last week's trading. Berkshire Hathaway reported better-than-expected profit growth for Q2. Tesla delayed cybertruck production until 2022, but the stock is up this morning on a price target upgrade. China has been reacting to various COVID outbreaks, and I fear the US could see more strict measures in the near future as well. This is worth following closely, as any lockdowns or countermeasures could be detrimental to stocks in the short-term, particularly the reopening plays. 

SPY is trading a bit under 442, and we could see some indecision this morning after hitting fresh ATH on Friday. DIA and QQQ are in similar technical levels after hitting fresh ATH in Friday's trading as well. I think we could be in for some choppiness, I'll be keeping an eye on UVXY if we do see some weakness. If we see strength and a push back towards ATH, then the strength should continue. Gold and silver are down a bit this morning, while crude oil is down considerably this morning. This is worth following closely, as crude oil is up quite a bit year-to-date and could see this as a correction.

Stocks finished mixed, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) remarkably recovering losses early in the session to narrowly eke out a new intraday record high despite massive geopolitical concerns and disappointing economic data coming out of China. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also recovered to finish roughly even while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, was down 0.75% at the time of writing.

China released economic data for July that showed growth rates slow down dramatically as the world’s second largest economy battles with summer flooding and the resurgence of coronavirus thanks to the highly contagious delta variant. Industrial production, a gauge of activity in the manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors, grew by 6.4% year-over-year in July, a sharp deceleration from the 8.3% rise in June and below the 7.9% growth expected. Retail sales, a key measurement of consumer sentiment in the world’s most populous nation, grew by 8.5% in July, way below the 12.1% increase in June and missing the 11.5% expected by economists.

The National Bureau of Statistics noted “the impact of multiple factors including the growing external uncertainties and the domestic COVID-19 epidemic and flooding situation,” according to a release. The bureau added that the “economic recovery is still unstable and uneven.”

In other, very, very sad news, disorder in Afghanistan further weighed on global markets, with chaos erupting in the capital city of Kabul the last few days as civilians tried to flee the country being swiftly overtaken by the Taliban. Amid the pullback of US forces after more than twenty years of being in the country, the Taliban have regained control of the country with terrifying, ruthless swiftness.

post,p5ul1o,,A driver died in a car crash involving a Nio car activated with driver-assistance feature,"Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO were weak Monday after a fatal accident involving a NIO car with self-driving features.  


The fatal crash of a NIO ES8 sport-utility vehicle took place last week in China. The SUV is equipped with several driver assistance functions, including features enabled by Intel (ticker: INTC) division Mobileye, that enable some forms of autonomous driving. NIO’s driver assistance functions are called NIO Pilot and employ cameras as the so-called eyes of the car.  


NIO has other autonomous-driving technology, referred to as NAD, such as radar, lidar—a laser-based radar—and camera vision, as well as computing power provided partly by Nvidia (NVDA) to process all the data points coming at the car.  


The NAD features don’t appear to be available on all NIO vehicles, including the ES8. All autonomous driving systems require the driver to pay attention to the road at all times.  


NIO responded to a request for comment with a Weibo post in Chinese. The post indicates the company is cooperating with police regarding the investigation.  


The global automotive industry is still wrestling with regulatory and branding issues surrounding autonomous technology. Self-driving features, such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assistance, make driving safer as long as systems are used as intended. But drivers might rely too much on the features when systems are dubbed pilot or autopilot. Government safety regulators, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, are still drafting plans to prepare for the introduction of more advanced self-driving features.

Beijing issued the newest implementation plan for Hydrogen Energy Industry development; Auto companies export volume has a YoY increase of 1.2 times; China Evergrande Vice-Chairman Xia Haijun has sold 3 million Evergrande shares; Autonomous driving problems are still being heated.

**Industry News**

On August 16, the Beijing Bureau of economy and information technology formally issued a notice on the ""Beijing Hydrogen Energy Industry Development Implementation Plan (2021-2025)"".

The implementation plan specifies how the hydrogen energy industry in Beijing will develop over the next five years from multiple perspectives.

In addition, according to CAAM statistical analysis, in July 2021, the export volume of auto companies hit a record high, of **which the contribution of new energy auto exports to growth was 31.5%.**

In July 2021, auto companies exported 174,000 vehicles, an MoM increase of 9.8% and a YoY increase of 1.8 times. From January to July 2021, auto companies exported 1.002 million vehicles, a YoY increase of 1.2 times, surpassing the entire year of last year.

Looking ahead, Citigroup said that it is optimistic about the strong fundamentals of the new energy vehicle industry. It is expected that the sales of new energy vehicles in August will increase by 8% month-by-month, or 164% YoY, reaching 266,000; BYD (1211.HK) and Geely (0175.HK) are the two companies with the highest penetration rate of new energy vehicles in the next two years.",4475,True,1629269303.0,2021-08-18 08:48:23,2,2,jiagzh7732,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p6lw3c/chinese_ev_daily_baidu_unveils_first_robocar/,True,0.58,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Stocks rose today, recovering some of the losses from earlier this week as market participants shake off some taper concerns. Market participants continue to weigh several factors affecting the market, including but not limited to (1) the taper timeline, (2) record-breaking corporate earnings, (3) and surging coronavirus delta variant infections. 

The S&P 500 (SPY) rose 0.79% today, recovering earlier losses, but finished the week 0.31% down. The Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.04% today and staged a remarkable comeback this week, coming from 2% down Thursday to finishing 0.01% higher. The Dow Jones (DIA) rose 0.65% today but finished the week 0.96% down, underperforming the other two major indexes. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, rose 1.68% today but finished the week 1.98% down.

On Wednesday, meeting minutes suggested members of the Federal Reserve were advancing the debate over the timing and scope of tapering the pace of the pandemic-era asset purchasing program. In the latest minutes, the Fed said, “looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.”As I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed’s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, “ most participants judged that the Committee’s standard of “substantial further progress” toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.",7722,True,1629492102.0,2021-08-20 22:41:42,55,9,psychotrader00,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p8dj0n/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_friday_august_20/,True,0.89,2021,both,search,False,False,0,

It's great that you care so much about the environment that you want to find the best solutions! otherwise, you wouldn't be finding all these detailed issues! Tell me, what are you doing to help fight climate change? What solutions do you have?

It was made Open Source for distribution in collaboration with Fully Charged, one of the most respected EV News sources on the internet. Youtube is a place where you need to grab the viewers attention quickly. Adding some lighthearted humor is an easy way to do that.  

>The video takes the total power used to run traditional oil pumps in the U.S. and says ""look, here's how much you could use that for in EVs. That's extremely disingenuous. 

I disagree. Power generation is power generation. So much electricity is already used to produce gasoline (yes, and other oil based products).

post,phiruh,,"Tesla further delays Cybertruck timeline to late 2022, Roadster delayed until 2023","The Tesla Cybertruck delay was already a known fact, but CEO Elon Musk's latest reported comments add a few more details to the picture. Citing sources familiar with the meeting, Electrek reported Thursday that Musk held a company-wide call and said the Cybertruck should be ready for production in late 2022.

If the company plans for beta trucks later this year, that leaves nowhere near enough time to start actual production in late 2021.

Following his comments, Tesla updated the Cybertruck's reservation page to note production will fire up in 2022. Though, according to Musk, we're not looking at early 2022 or anything like that. And as we suspected, the CEO underscored the electric truck's volume models may not be ready until sometime in 2023. If Tesla follows this timeline, we'll get the priciest tri-motor model in 2022, then the dual- and single-motor trucks in 2023.

Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla has delayed the new Roadster program to 2023, and even then, that’s only going to happen with a big “if.”  
The new electric hypercar is now three years behind its original timeline.  
When first unveiling the next-generation Tesla Roadster in 2017, Musk said that it will come to market in 2020.

Tesla started taking reservations for the impressive electric supercar with a 0-60 mph in 1.9 seconds and over 600 miles of range at the unveiling event.  
People who wanted to be first in line to get the vehicle had to put down between $50,000 and $250,000 in deposits.  
The vehicle program was later delayed, as the CEO said that it wasn’t a priority for Tesla.

post,pk1q6p,,Model Y- 1 year review,"I've had my 2020 Tesla Model Y for almost 1 year, picked it up mid September 2020 and I've put 11,250 miles on it. I figured some of y'all may be interested in hearing my thoughts. 

Let's start with the bad about the Model Y. First, the suspension. The Model Y is a very firm vehicle, it's not like a cushion or a pillow ride like some air suspension vehicles have. My friend has a Q8, which is way better than my Model Y. Another bad is the road-trip ability/charging. The supercharger network is praised upon by many people transitioning to Tesla vehicles but in my experience, it's been a mixed bag. I never felt like I would run out of range and always made it to my destination/supercharger with at least 10% battery. Supercharging is annoying. I made a trip to Houston and back in my Model Y and there are 3 charging stops along the way. The way it's mapped you have 2 options. If you stop at the first charger (Corsicana TX) you would have to stop at the 3rd Charger (Huntsville TX) otherwise you wouldn't make it. You may be thinking ok just go to the charger in the middle and have one-stop. That's even worse because Tesla only put 4 stalls at that location. On the way to Houston, I had 4 cars AHEAD of me. I waited 30 min just to get a spot, it was fine 25 min and I'd be on my way. I was kinda annoyed because a trip that takes 4 hrs 30 took close to 5 and a half hours pretty much. On the way back I figured I'd go to the outer two chargers, guess what happened, another wait, at both. The first one was a 15-minute wait then a 10-minute charge. The second one was a 10-minute wait with a 10 min charge. I guess a pro of taking the Tesla vs my Lexus was the charging was free, I got 2,000 free supercharging miles when I bought my vehicle. The big topic with Tesla though is Build quality. Oh boy, build quality is very inconsistent with Tesla.

post,pupybk,,"Desperate need of help! Rat got in my car, Tesla and independent shops don't want to help.","So for the last couple of days I have been beating my brains out trying to resolve this issue.

Vehicle: 2021 Tesla Model Y

A couple of days ago, a rat somehow got into my car.  I am guessing that it got into my backpack at work then got into the car after.  I noticed rat droppings and urine in the trunk area the following day.  In the evening while at work, I sat in my car to see if I could hear any rustling, which I did.  I tried looking for it but it would hide in an area I don't have easy access to.

I went ahead and bought several traps, both traditional clamps and glue traps plus bait; however, they have been unsuccessful.

Last night, I sat in my car again to see if I could hear it but I could not.   This worries me now because I don't know if it escaped the vehicle or if it's dead somewhere in the car where I can't find it.

I contacted Tesla to see if they would be able to inspect the crevices and panels but they said they consider this to be a hazmat issue so they refused to do it.

I contacted my insurance to make a comprehensive claim and they referred me to local body shops.  I had to filter through these body shops to make sure they are Tesla certified; however, every single place I called said that they won't deal with a rat infestation and that I should contact Tesla directly, which I already did.

I went ahead and made a claim with my insurance but I am worried that they won't be able to find a Tesla-certified body shop that would do this kind of work to begin with.

So between having a rat driving partner and the lack of available services, I am really stressed out.

post,pxjrmb,,What makes a Minivan a Minivan?,"I've been wondering for a while what makes a car a minivan and thus undesirable by pretty much everyone, so I would like to hear from the community what a car needs to be classified as a minivan instead of as a large crossover?


Some of my own thoughts:
At first I figured it was ground clearance, which holds some water, but it's not very definitive. 

Minivans:
Kia Carnival: 6.8""
Chrysler Pacifica AWD: 5.4""
Toyota Sienna/Woodland Edition: 6.4""/7""

Random samples of Midsize Crossovers:
Honda CR-V: 7.8""
Mazda CX-5: 7.5""
Tesla Model Y: 6.6""

Subcompact Crossovers:
Toyota C-HR: 5.9""
Kia Seltos: 7.3""
VW Taos: 6.6""

It doesn't seem to be that big of a difference. Maybe 1-2"" on average.


Is it the sliding doors? The [first gen odyssey](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/HondaOdyssey-001.jpg) and the [Mercedes R Class](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/2010_Mercedes-Benz_R350L_Grand_Edition_CDi_Automatic_3.0_Front.jpg) had normal rear doors and most still consider them as minivans.


Is it the styling? The new [Kia Carnival] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Kia_Carnival_KA4_red_diplomatic_%281%29_%28cropped%29.jpg) is obviously trying to buck that, but I haven't heard much of it working. I think most people still believe it to be a minivan.


Is it the front wheel drive based platforms? Both the Sienna and Pacifica now come as AWD variants and most crossovers are front wheel drive based as well. The Mercedes R class was even available as rear wheel drive.


With the rise of captains chairs in SUVs I don't think it's that either.


So I'm stumped and now ask you, r/cars, what makes a vehicle a minivan to you, instead of a long crossover?",1713,False,1632875359.0,2021-09-29 02:29:19,0,33,RazingsIsNotHomeNow,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/pxjrmb/what_makes_a_minivan_a_minivan/,True,0.27,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,py7bkp,,How Elon thinks - a distillation of his worldview,"Note: This is not a news piece but a distillation of many hours of listening to Elon. For those of us who've done it, it's hard to not admire his worldview, how he deconstructs the world around him to turn chaos into opportunities. I hope it's relevant to the community. Happy to delete it, if not. This is my attempt to find little snippets that give a glimpse into how his mind works :)

**We think in decades, Elon thinks in civilizations**

Take any argument on climate change and people talk about how it is going to impact our lives decades from now. We can barely see a few hundred years into the future. Here’s Elon talking about building a sustainable energy future that will be good for a billion years.

>We've essentially designed civilization to be super sensitive to climate change. The important thing to appreciate is that we are going to exit the fossil fuels era because at a certain point we will simply run out of carbon to mine and burn. So the question is really when do we exit this era, not if. The goal is to exit the era as quickly as possible. That means we need to move from the old goal, the pre-industrial goal, which was to move from chopping down forests and killing lots of whales to fossil fuels, which actually in that context was a good thing. But the new goal is to move to a sustainable energy future. We want to use energy sources that will be good for a billion years. The best case is simply delaying that inevitable transition to sustainable energy. The worst case is more displacement and destruction than all the wars in history combined. This is why I call it (burning fossils) the dumbest experiment in history. Why would you do this? The issue we have right now is that the rules fundamentally favor the bad outcome.  

**Learning by reading and talking to people**

Recent History: In July, Tesla reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings results, signaling that the company’s business is strong.

Recent Developments: A global chip shortage has hurt the auto industry. Last week, CEO Elon Musk said that the shortage will be “short term” and things will get better in 2022.

High Hopes: Investor Cathie Wood recently set a stock target of $3,000 per share for Tesla, and added that she would trim her stake in the company if it reaches that level.

Not a Value: Tesla’s price-to-earning’s ratio is over 400, which means this is definitely not a value stock. Still, this hasn’t stopped hoards of investors from backing the popular company.

Final Thoughts: Investing in Tesla is more than just about your outlook for the EV industry; it’s also about how you view Musk.

post,q5wo4j,,"My favourite quote from the Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future book!","
“There was little the mainstream auto industry could do to slow Tesla down. But that didn't stop executives from trying to be difficult whenever possible. Tesla, for example, wanted to call its third-generation car the Model E, so that its lineup of vehicles would be the Model S, E and X - another playful Musk gag. But Ford's then CEO, Alan Mulally, blocked Tesla from using Model E, with the threat of a lawsuit. ""So I call up Mulally and I was like, 'Alan, are you just fucking with us or are you really going to do a Model E?'"" Musk said. ""And I'm not sure which is worse. You know? Like it would actually make more sense if they're just fucking with us because if they actually come out with a Model E at this point, and we've got the Model S and the X and Ford comes out with a Model E, it's going to look ridiculous. So even though Ford did the Model T a hundred years ago, nobody thinks of 'Model' as being a Ford thing anymore. So it would just feel like they stole it. Like why did you going stealing Tesla's E? Like you're some sort of fascist army marching across the alphabet, some sort of Sesame Street robber. And he was like, 'No, no, we're definitely going to use it.' And I was like, 'Oh, I don't think that's such a good idea because people are going to be confused because it's not gong to make sense. People aren't used to Ford having Model something these days. It's usually called like the Ford Fusion.' And he was like, no, his guys really want to use that. That's terrible."" After that, Tesla registered the trademark for Model Y as another joke. ""In fact, Ford called us up deadpan and said, 'We see you've registered Model Y. Is that what you're gong to use instead of the Model E?'"" Musk said. ""I'm like, 'No, it's a joke. S-E-X-Y. What does that spell?' But trademark law is a dry profession it turns out.”

post,q9iyxe,,why are analysts often wrong about tesla?,"    why don’t market analysts understand tesla?
    
    i think this is indicative of a larger problem. look at all three industries tesla,
     tesla energy, and spacex represent. take spacex. making rockets cheaper and 
    reusable didn't take any technological breakthrough, just the intelligent insight 
    of someone conversant with both the engineering and the financial issues. the 
    actual expenditure to cover spacex development to the stage of reusability was 
    small when compared to nasa budgets, and nasa could have accomplished this same 
    innovation 30 years ago. why didn't it happen? institutional inertia, political 
    corruption, financial managers making engineering decisions. same story with tesla
     and tesla energy.
    
    we are a country filled with brilliant individuals, that is run by incompetent 
    and corrupt fools, and we are paying the price for it in multi-trillion dollars 
    losses in opportunity cost.
    
    take climate change as another example. take 1 trillion dollars, a drop in the 
    bucket on a global scale, build 20 gigafactories, the supporting battery 
    factories, and the supporting mining factories, and in three years you are
     producing 10 million tesla m2 a year. in 5 years you are producing 40 million 
    per year. adding FSD makes that 40 vehicles do the work of 200 million vehicles. 
    sell the cars at cost, say $10k. in ten years the world vehicle inventory has
     been replaced and one third of global CO2 emmisions have been eliminated. add 
    another trillion to do the same for solar and wind production to fix the energy 
    production problem. add a couple of trillion to cut the time down to five years.
    if these numbers are wrong, add another trillion until they add up. given the 
    eventual cost of the coming climate catastrophe, every trillion dollars you 
    throw into fixing the problem eliminates several trillion dollars in losses of 
    capital and human suffering.",2118,True,1634413077.0,2021-10-16 21:37:57,0,14,rainerdeusser,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/q9iyxe/why_are_analysts_often_wrong_about_tesla/,True,0.39,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

**Cash**

Operating cash flow less capex (free cash flow) of $1.3B in Q3

In total, $164M decrease in our cash and cash equivalents in Q3 to $16.1B

$1.6B GAAP net income; $2.1B non-GAAP net income (ex-SBC1) in Q3 30.5% GAAP Automotive gross margin (28.8% ex-credits) in Q3

**Operations**

Record vehicle production and deliveries in Q3
Started roll out of FSD City Streets Beta to a wider population in October

**Summary**

The third quarter of 2021 was a record quarter in many respects. We achieved our best-ever net income, operating profit and gross profit. Additionally, we reached an operating margin of 14.6%, exceeding our medium-term guidance of “operating margin in low-teens”.

Perhaps more impressively, this level of profitability was achieved while our ASP2 decreased by 6% YoY in Q3 due to continued mix shift towards lower-priced vehicles. Our operating margin reached an all-time high as we continue to reduce cost at a higher rate than declines in ASP.
EV demand continues to go through a structural shift. 

We believe the more vehicles we have on the road, the more Tesla owners are able to spread the word about the benefits of EVs. While Fremont factory produced more cars in the last 12 months than in any other year, we believe there is room for continued improvement. Additionally, we continue to ramp Gigafactory Shanghai and build new capacity in Texas and Berlin.

Numbers: Tesla’s earnings per share of $1.86 beat expectations. Its revenue of $13.76 billion was also better than what most analysts expected.

Good Margins: The company reported an operating margin of 14.6%, which exceeded its prior expectations for the quarter. Its total gross margin of 26.6% was a record for the company.

Half Glass Empty: Despite the good earnings, shares of Tesla dipped 1.64% in after-hours trading. The company cited numerous challenges during the quarter, including the chip shortage and congestion at the ports.

Missing: Tesla said that its new Cybertruck is still in development and offered no new updates.

Final Thoughts: Shares of Tesla are up 17% in the past month. It’s still one of the most polarizing stocks for investors.

Tesla and the others have a huge difference: Tesla plans to increase its FSD price every x years, meanwhile the others plan to give it for 0$ but never in an alpha/beta version, only finished systems but with a slower release rate.

Right now Tesla has the problem of being the 1st at charging a price for its system, which is like being the 1st at making the roomba and asking 10k$ for its advanced cleaning system vs the others just giving a basic cleaning system for free.

Tesla:

1. Roomba with AI, Lidar, bluetooth, autocharging, steam cleaning, room mapping, audio controlled, camera, auto picture to the phone with crashes.

Toyota/Nissan/Honda/etc

1. Roomba with crash detection

Then there is Waymo that its like tesla but if it only charges 50% of what tesla asks tesla is doomed.

Then comes the question, who will win this race? Maybe the people will want FSD in the highways but not in the streets (in that case Waymo would be in trouble).

Or maybe the people will want FSD in the streets but for free or at 10-50% of what tesla asks.

We will see the answer and the impact to the stock years after beta testing is over.",1470,False,1634995979.0,2021-10-23 15:32:59,0,27,stiveooo,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qe5175/the_coming_clash_of_teslas_10k_fsd_vs_the_0/,True,0.39,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,qera06,,Feeling constantly busy? 3 ways to fix that,"**busy** \[ˈbɪzi\] - *adjective*, **having a great deal to do**.

Or as I like to rephrase it, busy = almost every single person I know at all times.

It’s a relatively new thing in our culture, and not only among hustlers and adults. Maybe it’s a consequence of the ever-increasing schoolwork we need to get done, which serves to prepare you for the ever-increasing (in price) university degree, which then leaves you semi-qualified for a job you may not like that much. 

The answer to the question “What’s up?” is usually one of the two: “Nothing.” or “Oh, been busy.”.

Even if you aren’t feeling busy in particular, it feels logical that we prefer to exaggerate how busy our day is than admit to not doing much. After all, our societal perspective of the word “busy” carries a much more positive vibe.

However, this constant feeling of being behind doesn’t get us too far. Always being torn between different deadlines and projects to maintain, while you still have to take care of your own health, mind, social life - now that’s a surefire way to end up as a stressed-out burnout victim. Thankfully, there are ways to counteract this modern disease.

Spoiler alert for those who are too *busy* to read ahead:

1. Make clear objectives
2. Add buffer to your time blocks
3. Reflect frequently

>Oct 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surpassed $1 trillion in market value on Monday after landing its biggest-ever order from rental car company Hertz, a deal that reinforced the electric car leader's ambitions to top the entire auto industry in sales over the next decade.

>Tesla shares surged as much as 14.9% to $1,045.02, making it the world's most valuable automaker according to Reuters calculations based on its latest filing.

>Even Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk expressed surprise at the velocity of the surge. ""Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem,"" Musk tweeted in reply to a comment by Ross Gerber, co-founder of the investment fund Gerber Kawasaki and a Tesla shareholder.

>""Wild $T1mes!"" Musk wrote in a separate tweet.

>Tesla is the first carmaker to join the elite club of trillion-dollar companies that includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).

>Most automakers do not boast about sales to rental car companies, often made at discounts to unload slow-selling models. But for Tesla and its investors, Hertz's decision to order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022 showed electric vehicles are no longer a niche product, but will dominate the mass car market in the near future.

>""Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,"" Hertz interim Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters.

>Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has set an annual sales growth target of 50%, on average, eventually reaching 20 million vehicles a year. That would be more than twice the volume of current sales leaders Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).

post,qg4jcj,,Every Meeting Should Be Optional: Here’s Why…,"At the beginning of the year, we introduced a 100% optional meeting culture at our startup. At first, this might sound scary to many managers - *will anybody attend my meetings?* \- however, we've experienced that it's a key step towards a more productive meeting culture.

Disclaimer: I’m not advocating to dismiss all sync meetings, but rather to not make attendance mandatory. A simple act that has profound effects before, during, and after meetings.

The importance of Deep Work is already covered in various posts. So today, I’m discussing our less obvious lessons with optional meetings.

So let’s jump to it!

# Lesson 1: Optional meetings = better meetings

Meetings are no longer top-down or one-way exchanges of information. This is more so true of startups and async-first teams. Although there are exceptions to the rule, in 95% of cases, optional attendance increases the quality of meetings.

&#x200B;

**Reason 1: Optional meetings foster a give-first mentality among organizers**

Forced attendance doesn’t do meeting organizers any justice: If all meeting “participants” are forced to attend, meeting organizers aren’t incentivized to improve the meeting experience. In an alternate meeting world, if an organizer wants a higher attendance rate (*which you cannot force)*, then they’re likely to make voluntary participation more enticing.

*This could look like this:*

* Thorough agenda planning, so all can evaluate the meeting’s value. Thus, attendees will come prepared and increase the meeting output.
* Items only relevant to fewer attendees may be addressed first.
* An open-mic session, so attendees can discuss relevant points.

Over time, this effect will be compounded. The organizer is incentivized to sell the value of a meeting before it starts. The organizer also learns from what didn’t work.

&#x200B;

**Reason 2: Optional meetings are leaner**

Not everybody gets equal value out of any given meeting.",5724,True,1635248499.0,2021-10-26 13:41:39,4,1,BigSmile17,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/qg4jcj/every_meeting_should_be_optional_heres_why/,True,0.76,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,qj07jj,,On Tesla's valuation,"Tesla's valuation is probably one of the most hotly debated topics in the stock market these past few years. Tesla is certainly richly valued, and sentiments like ""Tesla has a higher market cap than all other automakers combined"" or ""Tesla has decades of growth priced in"" are very prevalent, especially on this sub.

That said, I noticed a trend where - although lots of different people are saying this and people defending Tesla's market cap are often downvoted - the people who make this argument never use any numbers to back up their claims. So I figured it might be nice to have an objective look at Tesla's trends and projections, run the numbers, and see how richly valued Tesla really is.

**For those who don't like reading, I will now explain how I got to my numbers. If you don't like reading, skip straight to ""The Numbers""**

----------------------------

**The method**

While trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap has risen slightly higher, let's use a market cap of $1T to determine if Tesla really deserves to be a trillion dollar company.

--------------------------------

**The trends**

In terms of revenue (LTM), Tesla has grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021. A 66% growth YoY.

In terms of operating margin, Tesla has grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021.

In terms of net income (LTM), Tesla has grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,468M after Q3 2021. A 524% growth YoY.

---------------------------------

post,qmjr7o,,"Tesla sells 1% of cars globally, yet is priced more than the companies combined that sell the other 99%","The valuation on Tesla is now beyond the absurd.  

Whilst European EV sales explode to presently 19% of all car sales this year, Tesla does not even make the top five EV sellers by company at a lowly 7%. (VW 25%; Stellantis 13%; Daimler 10%; BMW 10%; Hyundia-Kia 9%).

Tesla, unlike in the US, is simply being outsold by the vast array of alternative BEV models on sale particularly.  VW group alone offers the e-up, ID3 and ID4 (ID5 not yet on sale); Audi e-tron, e-tron Sportback e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT; Cupra Born; and Skoda Enyaq

In China Tesla has been pushed into 3rd place this year by BYD which has seen EV sales grow from 53K Q1; 98K.Q2; 183K Q3.  Tesla meanwhile has seen China quarterly sales for 2021 flattish at 69K, 62K and 75K.  China will likely sell 3 million EV's this year, half the worlds volume and Tesla sales are flat for the year.  Tesla might sell a lowly 9%.

Tesla dominates the US markets of course, where few EV models are on sale.  EV sales might be 3% of automotive sales.

Whilst investors will assert these stats do not.matter and Tesla's valuation is all about  tech, batteries and robo-taxis, it still does not sell any car related tech beyond its own cars.  Take up of FSD is a lowly 11%.  It still buys it's battery cells.  By its own statements it has a level 2/3 driver assist whilst companies like Waymo are already starting to offer level 4/5 robo-taxis in cities like San Fran (a free trial program has commenced).

With Tesla slipping badly in the two biggest and mature EV markets globally, it's EV mkt share has fallen from near 18% highs in 2019 to 14.7% YTD in 2021.  With Europe and China likely to see 20% EV sales, the Tesla domination of global car mkts story is looking utterly flawed, yet its market capitalisation is now than the entire companies combined that sell 99% of cars and are adding EV's faster.

post,qmllp4,,RIVN IPO on November 10,"Rivian is set to have a high profile IPO. Their S1-A prospectus released on Nov 1 is available here:
https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-315537/


**THE IPO FUNDAMENTALS**

Some key elements to pull out of here:

* 861M shares total
* 155M shares available during IPO (135M for public, 20M for underwriters)
* PT of $62

This gives RIVN a market cap of $55Bn with the goal of raising $8Bn in funding during this IPO.

**THE COMPANY FINANCIALS**

Right now, RIVN has zero revenue. Consider them like QuantumScape. They're set to release product soon, but they have no commercialized product currently.

In 2020, they racked up total operational net losses of $1Bn. In 2021, they're on track for net losses of $2Bn. These are all costs associated with what they term as ""Research and development"" and ""Selling, general, and administrative"".

Their goal is to operate in the truck market initially, focusing on consumer truck/SUV vehicles and then delivery fleet vehicles (EDV). This is similar to what WKHS/RIDE were trying to accomplish.

The S1 has RIVN projecting Amazon buying 100,000 EDVs from them, and growing the preorders of their R1T and R1S consumer models.

**THE PRODUCT**

RIVN is focusing on the SUV/Truck market, and this makes sense for America as trucks and SUVs consistently outsell all other vehicles on the road. Based on reviews, the R1T is ranked at 4th place comparing against other EVs by Car and Driver:
https://www.caranddriver.com/rivian/r1t

The R1T looks like a truck, and is designed very much to provide the culturally American truck experience. With the Cybertruck delayed into 2022, RIVN may have the first mover advantage, but again its hard to compare to TSLA who is just a runaway behemoth and cult brand at this point.

Car and Driver's review glow about Rivian's offroad and rugged capabilities. It really seems to live up to the hype. Though there are worries about battery efficacy compared to the ModelX. The R1T is priced $30k cheaper than the ModelX.",4004,True,1636035512.0,2021-11-04 15:18:32,55,52,radarbot,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qmllp4/rivn_ipo_on_november_10/,True,0.89,2021,both,search,False,False,0,

The next summer, visiting family in the Caribbean when I was 11, I got a chance to ride a Honda Lead and then learned sequential shifting on a 125cc Cub. On the same trip, My uncle taught me to drive his 5-speed Nissan Sunny (mostly I think so he could drag me to his Rotary Club meetings and get rum drunk, and I could nervously poke us back to the house at about 30kph in 2nd gear while he sang at the top of his lungs.)

Within a year of that, I was at the library obsessing about the story of Lee Iacocca and the ‘64 1/2 Mustang then deciding I wanted a ‘68 fastback, and then settling on a ‘69 Boss 302, or 429, or you know, at least a Mach 1. Never did get the Mustang, but have owned and driven and ridden in/on a huge variety of different cars, trucks and bikes in the ensuing 30 years. What I’d never driven or really experienced in all that time was a BMW.

I’d ridden in a cousin’s clapped out E21 3 Series as a littlun, and partially the fact that it was more rattling subwoofer than car (complete with Benzi Box and “NO / RADIO!” sticker), and partially that I was (incredibly uncomfortably) sat on someone’s lap, I was too young to appreciate anything special about it other than it was loud, rattly and scary. In the ensuing years, my dad always mocked and derided Bimmers and their drivers, mostly because we lived in NYC and I suppose most BMW drivers were a special brand of rude, self absorbed asshole in the 80s and 90s (saying a lot considering you have to be some of those things just to drive in Brooklyn.)

**The Company**

Rivian started way back in 2009 and before pivoting to trucks and SUVs, Rivian was also following the Tesla model with its first car [intended to be a sports car.](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uhCAQxp9muWkAEXYPHHrpaxCE0SWrYGG0tU9fXG-dTOZP8k2-yc9ZhCnlQyMUJGsqaPBYQUf4LjMgQiZbgWyC18RrqrhTAwnFjBlgsWHWZN2GOTiLIcVT1SlGJSNP7WTXi5668U6tEJRRIb1iMDrgo6CPx2VmNx8gOtCwQz5SBDLrJ-Jabt3HjX_WDLEED7CX1qWl7udntfWd6gWvQw57sLEpa8pYGmdzExM28OPmzYOvAhI0p5zVkIwz2j9a3krmhLoz4UcmBOeyxa8n3ukv3ARdJtaWbSho3ev0JFkvNr8AC0QMSy3tHPZTOZ0E3pIKwdS-bDHgYSDaYQavMW9A8EL7pmUmiJArcm8saiY7RaWQkjKpLhwV4MlKcElJ_cGnehX_2_8BlnyTSg)

 It was only in Dec’17 that the company announced its shift to an electric five-passenger pickup truck and an electric seven-passenger SUV. The company aims to have a vertically integrated structure with a vast majority of R&D occurring in-house.  

The idea is to not only sell the vehicles but upsell and also create recurring revenues from each sale. Rivan expects to make a whopping $67,900 per customer over ten years in additional revenue from products and services.

post,r475zh,,Why will stock markets fall drastically in 2021?,"Below are a few characteristics of big bubbles…

-Insanely high equity valuations.
Everyone is long risky/speculative assets.
The average retail investor who doesn’t do any research can buy any stock and make money.

-General price acceleration, along with insane price acceleration in different areas (Tesla, GameStop, Bitcoin, and etc.).

-Buy-in on central banks’ ability and willingness to bail everyone out.
While I could be wrong, I don’t think the trigger is really there for the bubble to pop. According to a research report by Bank of America:

“The global economy has maintained momentum into the new year, with expectations of 5.3% expansion this year, the strongest since 1973, up from 3.4% contraction in 2020.”

Under normal circumstances, there’d be a trigger for the bubble to pop, but we are NOT in a standard market regime.

The world has gone autopilot on quantitative easing (QE), which means creation of new money in order to help the economy.

This surplus-free liquidity, which is currently growing at 55% year-over-year in the U.S., is a lot higher than the 32% growth in liquidity after the 2008 crash.

Unlike in 2008, this time, monetary policy will team up with the fiscal side and really drive inflation to an extreme.

Just look at how the Fed’s balance sheet is at 42% of GDP.
The more central banks expand their balance sheet, the higher the stock market goes.

Remember the CARES Act, and now Biden calling for another $1.9T fiscal stimulus (more to come, I guarantee it)?

This is all NEW MONEY created that will flow into the real economy.

And so, as long as the Fed (and the world) keeps printing new money out of thin air, the stock market will continue to be inflated in value.

Which also means that it’s unlikely for anyone to really experience significant crashes.

While these forces are pushing the stock market higher, the amount of currency debasement (inflation) that will occur from all this new money creation will be massive.",3715,True,1638114392.0,2021-11-28 16:46:32,0,16,CassandraReys,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r475zh/why_will_stock_markets_fall_drastically_in_2021/,True,0.3,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,raml8o,,Is the party coming to an end?,"Just thinking ""aloud"" here. What can we expect in the coming years?

1. Slower growth  
Stock market returns over the last 15 or so years are largely the result of boomers in their peak earning years, rushing to prepare for retirement (and recover from the '00, '08 crashes). This trend will come to an end soon, as the majority of boomers retire over the next few years, and move towards more conservative investments. Maybe dividend stocks will become interesting again. Don't expect tech stocks to keep crashing to the upside.
2. Higher interest rates  
Inflation will force interest rates up, and the resulting increase in the cost of capital will slow corporate growth. This is a tricky one, because increased interest rates could make it hard to service the national debt, which is now over 100% of GDP - maybe they *can't* go up much.
3. Higher taxes  
Because of #2, government will need more revenue to service its debt. Also, high interest will drive down bond prices, so don't buy those. We'll also need more taxes to pay for the boomers' social security and medicare, from a smaller pool working-age people (gen X).
4. Lower housing prices  
Higher interest = lower housing prices. Also, the migration of high-earning professionals to the suburbs is decreasing demand - and supply of qualified buyers. But even if SFRs drop in price, they will still be unaffordable to the majority of people, so multifamily will likely not be affected much.

So... with lower growth on the horizon, we should focus on income. Stay away from high-PE stocks, wheel the SPY, and invest the premiums in some dividend ETFs.

I'm still expecting TSLA to keep crashing to the upside, because they're doing the right things at the right time: the transition to electric transportation and self-driving are as inevitable as the rise of the internet and smartphones, and they are years ahead of the rest of the industry.

post,ravhtu,,"Rivian is the one that could disrupt Tesla, analysts say","A flurry of Wall Street ratings boosted Rivian Automotive Inc. stock on Monday, nearly a month after the company went public, with analysts giving the Amazon-backed electric-vehicle maker mostly bullish endorsements.

Of the 13 analysts surveyed by FactSet, eight set ratings on Rivian that were the equivalent of buy, while the other five rated it the equivalent of hold. There are so far no bears. The average price target on the stock was $134.42, which was about 28% above Friday’s stock closing price of $104.67, and about 72% above the $78 initial public offering price.

The stock RIVN, +11.57% surged more than 4% on Monday, putting it on track to snap a four-session losing streak. It was now trading 37% below its Nov. 16 high close of $172.01, but was still 39% above its IPO price. **Baird analyst George Gianarikas initiated Rivian at outperform with a $150 stock price target**, saying he believes the company can “formidably challenge” Tesla Inc.’s TSLA, -0.59% market dominance. He said the company has adopted a “promising, vertically integrated approach,” reinforced by a robust balance sheet, Amazon partnership and strong recruitment.

“Vertical integration, however, requires scale to extract benefits, and, as such, Rivian needs to ramp quickly and effectively to materialize as a serious long-term contender,” Gianarikas wrote in a note to clients. “That is, Clark Kent (\[Chairman and Chief Executive\] RJ Scaringe) needs to emerge from the phone booth as Superman soon to scale Rivian and save the planet.”

**Wedbush’s Dan Ives also started Rivian with a bullish outperform rating, and set a $130 stock price target**, saying the “stalwart EV startup” is looking to strategically launch itself into an untapped market as SUV and pickup truck EVs are currently virtually nonexistent in the EV market.

post,reu1b9,,First 24hrs with my Model Y Performance (spoiler: full motor failure),"**Backstory**

I've always been into cars, and I was looking to get a new vehicle as my winter/practical car. I'm keeping my S4 and 718 Cayman S as well, so this was going to be in addition to those 2. I've been in enough Audi/BMW/Mercs/Porsches and wanted something different. Smooth power, roomy interior, cool factor and quiet ride were my main considerations. I don't need the all out performance of something like an X3M or GLC63 since I've got other cars. I wanted this to be a stark contrast to my current 2 vehicles.

&nbsp;

Decided a MYP would be a good fit, especially with very strong resale value. I can keep it for a few years and see what the electric market is like with Rivian, electric Macan etc. The ordering and delivery process was terrible, but that's another story. It was easily the worst ""dealership"" experience I've had buying any car (new or used).

&nbsp;

Anyways, I get my car on the evening of Dec 10th. By the afternoon of the 11th, it had a rear motor failure followed by a completely dead vehicle that's unable to drive. 

&nbsp;

**Motor Failure** 

Picked up my blue on white MYP on the evening of Dec 10th. By the afternoon of the 11th, it had a [rear motor failure](https://imgur.com/FqTE42h) and 2 mins later was [completely undriveable](https://imgur.com/2NQjz3W) and had to be towed to the dealer. It was being driven at 60km/h when a warning came up about the rear motor. A couple mins later, it was fully dead. Luckily I was near a friends house and parked it in their driveway. Would have sucked if this happened on the highway. I googled the error and it seems like this has happened to other people before, and usually pretty soon after delivery. Still, off too a pretty terrible start with the car.

This is a long post, and is rated PG-13.

**Brief History:**
I bought the CX-5 primarily for the higher seating position - was in a [white 2016 Honda Civic](https://imgur.com/aRvUqKH) before that - and secondarily for the gorgeous Soul Red, in the Touring trim with the Preferred package. The CX-5 was great for roadtrips, minor off-roading (read: non-paved roads in national parks), being very visible on the road to other drivers, had a robust safety suite (forward collision warning, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert - but no parking sensors for the 2018 Touring), and the candy apple red was a remarkable conversation piece. At the time it was a great deal and good value for the money (~$34k OTD).

The hankering for a convertible hit me when I saw a Mercedes-Benz drop its top at a stop light. The morning was sunny, wind was pleasant, outside temp was a breezy 70 (Fahrenheit). The idea - once taken root - never quite let go from 2019. I opened the sunroof on the CX-5 at most available opportunities anyhow so I began my… 

**Research:**
I didn’t take action until the CX-5 was paid off (and driven nearly [46k miles](https://imgur.com/JUJf3KR)) , but once it was I began looking.

Can afford a really swanky multi-story house in a rich neighbourhood, flies around as much as they please, can afford expensive medical treatments or cosmetic surgeries, pay for any top-end educational endeavour they want like an Ivy League institution, or invest in ventures like politics campaigns, philanthropy or start-ups.

post,rmbhqh,,My extensive Porsche Taycan Turbo Review,"My Model 3 AWD lease is about to end. While I generally have positive things to say about my Tesla experience, my Tesla hasn’t exactly been scratching my itches as a car enthusiast. So I am currently at a bit of a crossroads, buy another Tesla and get an affordable-ish sports car. Or combine the funds into one nicer vehicle. 

The problem with the one nicer vehicle is the fact that it does need to be EV. While I am sure a lot of great EV vehicles will burst onto the scene in the next three years, there’s really only one car on the market currently that feels like it might be an upgrade from my Tesla while also satiating my enthusiast desires and that is the Porsche Taycan. 

Now I’ll be honest in saying that I am by no means a Porsche fan. I drove a 997 911 Turbo as well as a 718 Cayman base and I walked away from both cars feeling like they were sports cars on Xanax. They just weren’t exciting for me. 

Likewise, I am by no means a Tesla fanboy. I think they have EV offerings that make a lot of sense, but as a car enthusiast I do long for something that feels a bit more special. 

Unfortunately when reading comparisons between Tesla’s and Taycan’s they pretty quickly devolved into descriptions that felt too simple to me. “If you want a well built car with a great driving experience get the Taycan” “If you want a good charging network, like technology, and need lots of range get a Tesla” While I knew both of those general sentiments to be inherently true, I felt like they were leaving out a lot of details and that the folks righting these statements were inherently pro Tesla or pro Taycan making it hard to find what felt like an unbiased opinion.

post,rr7lja,,"SUV, CUV, crossover, off-roader, adventure vehicle. . .","I've been griping for a while about this industry trend of advertising every possible vehicle as a ""SUV"", because the marketing departments have all decided that's the word that sells cars, the label that shoppers respond to.  One of the most egregious examples (IMHO) is the Tesla Model Y.  I mean, it's a Model 3 sedan with a slightly *taller* profile and a hatch back.  Yet it seems like everyone calls it a SUV.  Tesla call it a SUV.

You take a sedan, you give it a higher stance and a hatch back, and there's an established word for that: CUV (crossover utility vehicle), or just ""crossover"".  Because it crosses over between the sedan and SUV categories, right?  That was logical.  But somehow that didn't resonate with the public, and they don't want to buy a crossover or CUV, but they are happy to buy the exact same vehicle if it's called SUV.

So, what are we going to call actual, real SUVs now?  What is the Jeep Wrangler?  What is the Ford Bronco?

As mentioned, I've been griping about this for a while, but now I'm beginning to question myself.  Why am I trying to defend the purity and correct usage of ""SUV"", itself a clunky and kind of dumb marketing buzzword that I never liked to begin with?  Maybe I should just give it up and accept that from now on the ugly term SUV is what we use to describe crossovers, a category  of ugly vehicles that I never liked to begin with.  Let them belong together; they deserve one another.

As for actual off-roaders. . .   Hmm.  Maybe we should call them ""off-roaders"".  Didn't we used to call them that, once upon a time?  Please, let's not make them ""adventure vehicles"" now.

# EV performance & its accessibility

I'll start with what ultimately sold me on the car - **Immense, instant power.** The war in the ""pure acceleration"" category is pretty much over - just take a look at Jason Cammisa's video with the Model S Plaid vs. the BMW M5 CS and Cadillac Crazy. They're not even on the same planet. Not only is the acceleration brutal, but it's consistent (everything else held constant - more on that later). Look up any number of 0 - 60 videos on YouTube, and you'll notice that the times are all remarkably close, especially if there are multiple runs in the same video.

post,rucgh4,,"2022 Tesla, NIO and LUCID -what to expect","Source:  TheStreetTesla

After a rocky 2020 for the entire auto industry, electric vehicle sales rebounded in 2021 amid high demand for vehicles and a shortage of actual cars to buy. Tesla, to be fair, never really suffered the way many traditional automakers did. The EV-maker led by CEO Elon Musk found ways to keep vehicle deliveries at steady, record levels even as chip shortages caused some automakers to cut production goals.

Part of that, of course, comes because Tesla's overall volume -- while steadily growing -- remains much smaller than the higher-volume traditional automakers. But, it's a tribute to the company's innovation that it managed to grow despite a global chip shortage that impacted the entire auto industry.

EV rivals NIO and Lucid are in a much earlier phase of their journeys, but all three companies have major plans for 2022.

## What Will Tesla Do in 2022 (and Beyond) ?

In the coming year Tesla will expand its capacity as new factories come online. The EV leader now has four factories online -- Fremont, Shanghai, Austin, and Berlin. CFO Zach Kirkhorn laid out where the company stands and where it's going in his remarks during the company's[ Q3 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/21/tesla-tsla-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcript/) with investors.

""Over the last 12 months, we've done about 430,000 cars of production. And based upon everything that we know in the factory, where the bottlenecks are, what the potential is, we're targeting to increase that another 50%,"" he said. ""I think that will be a difficult goal but that's the goal that the internal team has, and they're going to continue to push on that.""

Tesla has ambitious plans to grow how many vehicles it can produce, according to its CFO.

""You know, we're trying to get to 5,000 cars a week as soon as we can,"" he said. ""And then we'll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to 10,000 cars per week at those factories.",5312,True,1641138954.0,2022-01-02 16:55:54,66,149,Vast_Cricket,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/rucgh4/2022_tesla_nio_and_lucid_what_to_expect/,True,0.81,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

post,rx6jl4,,Financing a Tesla Model 3,"First time financing a car so I really appreciate the help!

I'm financing a Model 3 soon, and I'm confused on the importance of downpayments. I've heard of the 20% rule but looking at how a 10%, 20%, or 50% downpayment affects the total cost of the car over the 72 months, it seems like a large downpayment could be split into investing the money into stocks and crypto, and I can just go off the bare minimum downpayment. Other than the lower monthly payment and avoiding depreciation of the car, I don't see the importance of a huge downpayment.

MSRP of the car is $46490 with my design. A 10% downpayment is about $4.5k, and this puts the total cost of the car over 72 months at $51084. 20% downpayment (\~$9.1k) has a total cost of $50716. Finally, a huge 50% downpayment (\~$23k) has a total cost of $49640. These numbers were all calculated on Tesla's website using their downpayment adjustment and multiplying 72x the monthly payment. These total costs have such a narrow range of cost difference for the huge downpayment ranges. APR rate is 2.49% for all costs.

My confusion comes in over why you wouldn't just choose a bare minimum downpayment and throw most of your money stocks or crypto. I'm sure I could easily make up that $500-1500 price difference of total cost by investing the $4.5k (or a huge chunk of the $23k) into stocks like $AAPL or $TSLA. Even BTC or ETH would have great yields over a 2-3 year timeline.

**TL;DR**: Wouldn't a huge downpayment be better split into a minimum downpayment with the other portion of money going into investments? This is assuming the price range of the total cost is very narrow, regardless of a 10%, 20%, or 50% downpayment.",1684,False,1641446534.0,2022-01-06 06:22:14,5,15,bigfdapresident68,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/rx6jl4/financing_a_tesla_model_3/,True,0.73,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,s0ncv2,,Intel Drops A Bomb On The Robotaxi Industry,"Original article at Seeking Alpha (non-paywall link): [https://archive.is/CUIAS](https://archive.is/CUIAS)

## Intel Drops A Bomb On The Robotaxi Industry

## Summary

* Despite  most investors focusing on Tesla for robotaxis, Intel’s Mobileye is  currently in volume production of its camera-only L2+ autonomous driving  SuperVision system, beating all competitors to the punch.
* Moreover,  Mobileye announced the world’s first L4 consumer vehicle, launching in  early 2024. Mobileye has a substantial technology and first-mover  advantage.
* If  Tesla bulls can attribute a $1T market cap to their company’s  non-existent robotaxis, then initiating Mobileye at a $1T price target  (representing 20x upside) seems reasonable.
* Mobileye could hence become one of the greatest investments of the coming decades.

## Investment Thesis

In a significant bit of news that likely went largely unnoticed by the investment community, not Tesla ([TSLA](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)), Nvidia ([NVDA](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)) or anyone else, but actually Intel ([INTC](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link))  Mobileye achieved a major milestone in late 2021 by going into volume  production of its camera-only SuperVision autonomous driving system.  Combined with Mobileye's robotaxi business that will start operating in  two international cities in 2022 (based on a camera-based system  combined with a lidar and radar-system), this means autonomous driving  has finally gone from the lab to the fab, and is poised to contribute  billions or even trillions in value to the economy as the technology  gains scale in the coming years and decade(s).",13866,True,1641830554.0,2022-01-10 17:02:34,70,117,polloponzi,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/s0ncv2/intel_drops_a_bomb_on_the_robotaxi_industry/,True,0.71,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,s2baha,,Ya want tires with that?,"A funny thing I've noticed whenever I take my car—either car, the Roadster or the S—into the service center for any reason:  I’m always told, in concerned tones, that my tires are “almost bald” and should be replaced.

I mean, I don’t think I’ve ever gone in with fresh tires just put on the car, but my tires are not almost bald. I have a gauge, I monitor the tread depth, I recently had the S tires rotated. I know what I’m doing. I’ll get new tires when I need them. And the guys telling me I need new tires never mention any actual tread depth measurement. So what’s going on with these guys?

So, here’s my theory. . . Most Teslas on the road are not that old at this point, and I reckon a very large portion of the work done at the service center is warranty work, which means only cost to Tesla, no revenue. Ah, but if they can sell you some tires! Ka-ching! So I think these guys must be trained to tell everyone they need new tires. Sort of like McDonald’s, “You want fries with that?”

And this is not really a complaint, just something I found amusing. I have doubts about how many Tesla owners actually buy their tires from the Tesla service center anyhow. I’ve never had any urge to do that, since I have been getting my tires for many years from a place that’s much closer to me. I can shop for tires online, have them sent directly to the shop, and it couldn’t be easier.

I do suggest buying a quality pressure gauge and a tread depth gauge and looking after your tires. I mean, there’s not much else on a Tesla that needs careful monitoring. Just keep it plugged in (a plugged-in Tesla is a happy Tesla!) and keep the tires in good shape, and you should be golden.",1681,False,1642007339.0,2022-01-12 18:08:59,1,3,ZobeidZuma,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/s2baha/ya_want_tires_with_that/,True,0.53,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

The person said the delay comes as Tesla is changing features and functions of the electric pickup to make a compelling product as competition heats up in the segment.

Tesla is expected to make limited production of the Cybertruck in the first quarter of 2023 before increasing output, the source said.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

post,sb7c3z,,My 2019 Model 3 LR vs 2022 Model 3 Performance vs 2022 Model Y Performance Comparison,"I currently own a Tesla Model 3 that is near the end of its lease. The hope was that by the time my Model 3’s lease was over other manufacturers would start to have suitable competitors to Tesla in the EV space. While we’re starting to see that happen, most options are either way out of my price range (Taycan, Audi E-Tron GT) or feel like they haven’t quite matched Tesla yet in terms of range and performance (Polestar 2, Jaguar I-Pace, etc). The BMW I4 M50 is something I’m definitely keeping an eye on, but I could run into availability issues just knowing when my lease is due. So I decided to go to my local Tesla shop to try both the Model Y Performance and Model 3 Performance to see how they stacked up to my current car. 

Since I am already coming from a Tesla I am not going to highlight things like technology, charging infrastructure, etc. I mainly going to focus on the differences between models in terms of design, handling, power, and things that would be most relevant to folks who are a bit more concerned about the overall driving experience.

Lastly, I did only have 30 minutes with each car. But I was able to drive the cars on about 40% of my daily commute and on roads that I am very familiar with (the Tesla service center is a few blocks away from my house). So this is about as apples to apples of comparison as I think I can reasonably give. I do think it’s helpful that I was able to drive these cars back to back and on roads that I know well. 

**Handling:**

**Model Y Performance**

I have to be honest in saying that I am not at all someone who has ever considered a CUV due to my personal emphasis on driving dynamics, however I was pleasantly surprised by the Model Y Performance.

post,sd4fbh,,"I daily drove a 2001 Ferrari 550 Maranello for 2 1/2 years, AMA","Hello /r/Cars,


I first fell in love with the 550 in 1998 when I saw a video of a red one on a track being expertly tossed by what looked like a properly skilled/crazy driver who sang praises of its handling and power, in addition to its GT comfort and understatedly elegant design.  At that point I made up my mind that I just had to find a way to own one someday.  Then Bad Boys 2 came out and it was confirmed that mine would need to be Grigio Titanio.  Almost 20 years later, I found myself in the very lucky and privileged position to begin my search for a 550.  The “perfect car” was on consignment at a Ferrari dealer in Southern California; a 2001 final model year example in excellent condition with only 21,000 miles, rare carbon fiber interior, Daytona seats, one-off custom BBS LM 19” wheels, and a McIntosh show car stereo, the removal of which drastically improved performance and handling.  Our goal was to make it the ultimate daily drivable example through the addition of tasteful modifications designed to improve upon the original design and purpose of the car, as well as the overall driving experience.

Here are a few photos of the car:

post,sdggsx,,Tesla earnings are out – here are the numbers,"Tesla reported fourth-quarter earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings (adjusted): $2.54 vs $2.36 per share expected, per Refinitiv

Revenue: $17.72 billion vs $16.57 billion expected, per Refinitiv

Revenue rose 65% year over year in the quarter, while net income, at $2.32 billion, was up some 760%, according to a statement.

Tesla reported a 27.4% gross margin, compared with 26.6% in the previous quarter.

“Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through 2022,” the company said.

The report comes in the midst of the most important tech earnings season in years. The Nasdaq has suffered its worst January since 2008 as many investors have begun to sour on the promise of high-growth tech stocks.

In 2021, Tesla delivered 936,172 vehicles, an 87% increase versus 2020 when it reported its first annual profit on deliveries of 499,647. Its 2021 deliveries included 308,600 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter. (Deliveries are the closest approximation to sales reported by Tesla.)

CEO Elon Musk and other execs are expected to give a progress update on the company’s long-delayed heavy duty Semi truck, experimental Cybertruck pickup, and plans for driverless vehicle systems and a $25,000 compact car.

With factories being built in Austin, Texas, and Brandenburg, Germany, shareholders also want to know when high-volume vehicle production and deliveries are expected to start at each plant.

Tesla’s guidance may be tempered by supply chain issues, if Musk’s tweets are any indication. On November 29, 2021, he wrote on Twitter, “Oh man, this year has been such a supply chain nightmare & it’s not over! I will provide an updated product roadmap on next earnings call.”

post,sep6ud,,"Unlike popular opinion, Tesla's valuation is far from unjustifiable - An analysis based on the numbers","While the overwhelming sentiment around this sub still seems to be that Tesla's valuation is unjustifiable, I have yet to see someone explain that using real data instead of reasoning by analogy (""but Toyota/VW sell X cars"" and is only worth Y""). Looking purely at the numbers, it seems to me Tesla is starting to become insanely undervalued.

This post is largely based on a recent video by Tesla Daily. I believe links to YouTube aren't allowed, but it's his Jan 28th video for anyone who wants to see the detailed version.

So here are the numbers:

After Tesla's Q4 earnings and subsequent 11.5% drop in stock price, its market cap dropped to $833B. Total GAAP earnings for 2021 came in at $5.5B, giving us a PE ratio of 151. ""Ridiculous!"" I hear you say.

Well not so fast. Tesla's earnings in 2021 were up 665%, Q4 earnings was up 760% YoY and earnings in Q1 were just 1/6th of Q4. If we annualize Q4 (basically projecting 0% growth in 2022), we're already at a GAAP net income of $9.3B, or a forward PE of 90.

Now obviously Tesla won't be doing 0% growth in 2022, so let's look at some of the things that seem a given.

First of all, Tesla ""paid"" $910M in stock-based compensation to Elon Musk in 2022 for his CEO compensation plan. For 2022, there is only $65M of that plan left. Since this affects GAAP earnings, this will already mean an $845M increase to Tesla's 2022 earnings. Of course there might be a new compensation plan in the future, but this almost definitely won't affect 2022 and it would only come into effect if the stock rise significantly (I'm personally expecting it to be a plan for $2, 3, 4, ..., 10T in market cap)

Next, Tesla had an increase in SG&A of $340M because of Elon exercising his options. This was a one-time expense that will not occur in 2022. Adding these together, that's an added $1,185M to Tesla's bottom line in 2022, all other things equal. This would bring their PE down to 79.

Then we've got growth.",4862,True,1643371202.0,2022-01-28 13:00:02,270,594,Ehralur,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sep6ud/unlike_popular_opinion_teslas_valuation_is_far/,True,0.68,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

If employees could own, use, or try the product they work on... they could actually understand what real owners go thru.

Other nice perks could be free enabling of software features like FSD or FUSC (maybe free charging credits per month).

post,she5td,,"Tesla earnings growth justifies its valuation, here’s the data.","Hey /r/investing, 

I am here to point out that at the moment, Tesla is the most undervalued tech/teracap (stocks that are or were once worth $1 trillion) stock measured by price to earnings growth. All the data will be here in this post.

But first, I want to address some folks here who think Tesla is overvalued because the P/E is 189 (which is down from 1,100 at the end of last year due to blistering fast earnings growth and will be under 100 if Tesla doesn't grow earnings from it's Q4 pace) while American automakers like Ford and GM have P/E around 12 and 7 respectively. Be prepared for some data. 

Tesla is not like Ford or GM and shall not be valued as such. The only similarity is that a majority of revenue comes from cars. However, Tesla is growing revenue much more like a tech company than a car company like for or GM. Tesla also has much higher margins than Ford and GM, and virtually no debt. They are also already 100% EVs while Ford and GM have to transition their sales to EVs. Here's the data :

&#x200B;

**Tesla Revenue growth versus tech and cars**

|Company|Years to grow from $10B to $50B|Years to grow from $10B to $100B|

&#x200B;

1) I'll start with the risks to my valuation model: 

In my opinion, the biggest risk to Tesla is failing to execute on the growth plan. The biggest hindrance I can see for Tesla's valuation will be failing to achieve their 50% YoY growth targets.

If there's an actual economic recession where consumers have to drastically cut back spending, then Tesla would definitely suffer. But this risk is obvious, and probably applies to 99% of growth stocks. Side note: Tesla currently makes such good margin on their EVs, that they have the flexibility of dropping prices to meet demand; however, this would greatly cut into earnings and reinvesting into growth. 

And of course there's the silly, but still very valid, risk to the valuation of companies that the market takes an irrational dive of 20%+, and investors lose confidence in stocks for the foreseeable future. However, Tesla's growth target might still be attainable in this economic environment.

I do \*NOT\* see new EVs from other companies entering the market as a risk to Tesla. There are 80M auto sales globally every year. My model calculates that Tesla obtains 12.1M of the sales (in 2027). This leaves plenty of room for legacy automakers and new EV manufacturers to sell millions of their own EVs.

Quick Note: This model is based \*only\* on EV sales.

**TL;DR: I've wanted a Tesla ever since I heard about them in 2016 and saved/invested accordingly, but life circumstances may have reached a tipping point where I missed my chance.**

I've owned and purchased TSLA stock since 2017 (I wish I bought more, blah blah) and while it's treated me very well, I don't intend on using profits for anything until retirement. After all, why pay taxes and lose out on future gains for something I don't need now, when I have high conviction about future value?

I work from home making 6 figures and my wife works as well, so we're fortunate enough to be well above the average, both nationally and locally. Technically I *could* afford a Model 3 or Y well enough, and even have remaining funds to continue putting aside for bills, investing, trips, etc. We're also having our first baby this summer, but I have planned financially for that as well. Personal finance and budgeting has become a bit of a hobby/obsession of mine these past few years, so it's not a matter of spending beyond my means but rather spending beyond my needs.

All this being said, my wife and I differ greatly on our views of technology and large purchases. I'm a big tech nerd, and a Tesla is the current pinnacle of lifestyle tech in a device I can use almost every day for years to come.

post,soedun,,Questions regarding undercoating for my truck,"I live in Michigan, so salt and rust is a major issue. I recently got an '18 Sierra, and hope to have it for a long time. That said, rust is the biggest concern I have. 

From what I've read, most people say just stick with Fluid Film and call it day. The problem is I don't have the means to easily do it myself, so it would be a pretty big undertaking to do it once or twice a year. I haven't tried too hard, but I haven't seen any local shops that offer it, or at least none that advertise that they do. Most do Krown, which I've heard to avoid.  I also hear people saying to stay away from rubber/tar coatings as it can actually make things worse. This brings up 2 questions:

&#x200B;

1. A local Line-X dealer uses ValuGard, which they describe as a wax/petroleum hybrid. The application process is to clean the frame first, then they ""fog"" it with the anti-rust and a wax sealent, then apply the hard Line-X black coating. This seams to be a better process then just spraying some FLexseal on it and walking away. Is this a better process or just some smoke and mirrors to make me feel good? They would give it a 7 year warranty if the car is less than 5 years from the model year. 
2. If it isn't a good process, why is it worse then nothing at all? I'm just curious how it would exacerbate rusting, as I've seen some people mention, since the water and salt can get trapped behind any imperfections. But if it's wide open to the road and air, it always has exposure. Wouldn't this help lessen the total area that's exposed?

&#x200B;

**Chapter 1. Bull thesis (and other lies I tell myself?)**

&#x200B;

Let's start with the typical bull thesis. The one you have probably encountered many times in the wilderness of reddit or twitter. It goes like this:

&#x200B;

* Tesla's car sales will grow 50% annually for foreseeable future. Eventually reaching annual production rate of 20M by 2030. Source: [Technoking himself](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393)

&#x200B;

* Net margins will stay as high or even grow further from the latest 13.1% (Q4 2021). Commonly cited reasons are 4680, Gigacasting... maybe even Alien Dreadnought?

&#x200B;

* Tesla is a tech company. They will generate tons of revenue by selling software such as ~~Fraud~~ Full-Self-Driving, and might eventually launch their own marketplace (see AppStore).

&#x200B;

* Tesla is... *ETF**?* (cannot add a link to youtube video, but it is from solving the money problem)

&#x200B;

* Tesla ~~sex~~bot. Enough said.

&#x200B;

Let's start with an automotive sales part:

&#x200B;

* Say Tesla is such Gigachad^(TM) that it reaches 20M sales without reducing the prices or introducing the cheaper model(s). According to Q4 2021 Financial Report, current **ASP is $50.7K**, derived as auto revenue excl. regulatory credits divided by the number of delivered cars. Assuming 3% average inflation for the next 9 years (incl. current spike) the ASP in 2030 would be **$66.2K** (50.7 x 1.03\^9)

&#x200B;

* With **net margins of 13%** that would result in **66.2K x 20M x 0.13 = $172B net income**.

&#x200B;

* Eventually growth by 2030 will taper and converge to automotive industry average. As of writing, PEs of auto peers: Toyota - 9.64, Volkswagen - 6.88, Ford - 10.10, GM - 7.10, BMW - 4.75.

In this article I talk about the current insane volatility and dooms-day scenario we find ourselves in and specifically how Tesla and electric vehicles can not only save the planet, save your life but also save you lots of money.

It has never been more important to own an Electric Vehicle than it is now, so here is EXACTLY HOW this information ties to your stock portfolio…..

# The Increasing NEED to own an EV⚠

The market in 2022 is absolutely crazy, inflation has reached the highest levels since 40+ years ago. Meanwhile you might have gotten a 5% raise, woo-hoo, oh. Wait. Because inflation is so f\*cking high you’re purchasing power STILL decreased year over year! How crazy is that? The recent macro currents have not been this unpredictable in a very long time, with both the Federal Reserve tightening and potentially WW3 breaking out with the Russian potential invasion of Ukraine.

Because of all this, it is simple. You need an EV. You' need an EV, because it will drastically reduce the amount of money you’re spending on fuelling up your car and getting it serviced. Tesla recently released an amazing feature that highlights the money Tesla owners are saving by not-having to buy gas for their cars. It’s quite staggering.

In one example a Tesla user saved nearly $300 per month, *$300!* Do you not see how crazy that is? With recent gas prices reaching nearly $5 a gallon, it is becoming unjustifiable to purchase an Internal Combustion Engine vehicle as opposed to an EV.

It is a fact that a Tesla will save you money on fuel costs, maintenance, and depreciation.",9926,True,1645567291.0,2022-02-22 23:01:31,0,28,Gamersville101,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/syzoi2/why_the_world_needs_electric_vehicles_badly_in/,True,0.29,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,t4odz9,,I spent February renting and driving enthusiast cars.,"There are countless videos on each of these cars but you never know the full picture until you actually live with one. I rented each car for 4-10 days and drove ~400 miles per rental. I'll tell you what I thought of each car with 2-3 sentences, and then pros and cons just below if you want to know a little more.

#**Lexus LC500**
This car is theatrical in every aspect. Engine sound, interior and exterior design, even the gauge cluster. But it's a large car for something trying to be a sports car and there's almost no space to put anything inside. I can't imagine paying $100,000+ for a car this big with less storage than other GTs.

**Pros:**
- Futuristic styling with theatrical interior and exterior.  
- Incredible muscle car engine note that pipes into the cabin very well.  

**Cons:**
- Absolutely terrible infotainment you won't be able to (easily) replace.  
- The smallest trunk for a car this size. The packaging is questionable.   
- Not as fun to drive as other cars in this price point. Feels boaty.  

#**The Ioniq 5**  
My second rental. My first non-Tesla EV. This may just be the best value EV on the market with a sticker price $10,000 below a Model Y but with the same size, similar range, and excellent roomy interior. The biggest downside with my week of ownership was Electrify America where I had to find a new stall to park **FIVE** different times as each stall I pulled into had a unique problem. It actually took me longer to park and troubleshoot than it did to charge.

**Pros:**  
- Gorgeous spacious interior that makes anything else feel cramped.   
- Really fast charging. A 15-20 minute stop is truly all you need.  
- The closest thing to what Tesla provides in ownership experience with a range that went beyond what was claimed. I loved this car.  

**Cons:**  
- Start/Stop Button. It's an EV! I shouldn't have to tell it to turn the ""engine"" off.   
- There's a frunk that just shouldn't be there. You can maybe fit a laptop or a sack lunch.",4923,True,1646185369.0,2022-03-02 02:42:49,255,78,asimo3089,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/t4odz9/i_spent_february_renting_and_driving_enthusiast/,True,0.93,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,t7kfyf,,US Ford Fiesta ST: 2 year ownership review,"I had written a long reply yesterday to someone about my experience with my Fiesta ST and was told I should submit a post based on it. 

I bought my [2018 Ford Fiesta ST](https://imgur.com/a/FI9agfu) just over 2 years ago, 2 months before the start of the pandemic. 

My previous car was a [7th generation Honda Accord V6 6 speed coupe](https://imgur.com/a/poQPCYO) which I had for just over 10 years.

My Accord ran as well the day I sold it as the day I bought it, my major reasons for getting rid of it was that I wanted more practical cargo space, a bit more fuel efficiency and most importantly for me at the time, 4 doors. 

Another major reason for buying my Fiesta ST at that point was that Ford had discontinued the Fiesta (and all of their other cars except the Mustang) after the 2019 model year. If I was to buy a Fiesta, I wanted to buy one new as I had seen so many owners modify their cars. 

 I had been interested in the Fiesta ST after seeing it featured by various car journalists I follow. ^[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRu_iQUVNtg),[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10L-WFsVaw0),[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-4OIxm3XaE),[4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU9obX0J5VM),[5](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15089257/2017-ford-fiesta-st-instrumented-test-review/) 

I still spent several months doing test drives of all the hot hatches available to me before making my decision. Cars I tested included the Focus ST, Focus RS, GTI, Golf R, Civic Type R, Veloster N & Hyundai Elantra GT Sport. 

I ultimately went with the Fiesta ST due to its size, fun at normal driving speeds (I drive mostly under 60 mph, predominantly on city/suburban roads with a bit of highway) and competitive price. 

The cars which came closest for me were the GTI & Veloster N. I rejected the GTI because my mechanic warned me about higher repair costs & the Veloster N due to it only having 3 doors.",6921,True,1646519170.0,2022-03-05 23:26:10,94,56,cocoagiant,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/t7kfyf/us_ford_fiesta_st_2_year_ownership_review/,True,0.9,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,tdpkn4,,You have to be crazy not to own Tesla,"At just below $800, it's at the price it was on October last year. Except this month we have a gigafactory coming online and a second gigafactory next month. They're also surpassing analyst expectations on earnings and deliveries every single quarter. Q1 will be no exception.

Current gas prices have only accelerated the demand for Teslas, and will likely continue to. Tesla can freely raise their prices and still sell every vehicle they make.

And if that's not enough, we have Full Self Driving to look forward to. You can doubt whether it'll come this year or next year, but when it comes it'll revolutionize transportation. We're not talking robotaxis like Waymo that are restricted to San Francisco. We're talking robotaxis that can think dynamically in every driving environment, without it needing to be pre-mapped. Given the feedback from beta testers, it's advancing very quickly, and yes it could meet human driving expertise this year. And the stock price will experience a massive ralley as result.

FSD may or may not come this year, but given that Tesla is an absolutely solid company growing over 80% each year, when it's expected to grow 50%, it simply has the best risk/reward ratio out of any company you could buy. It's a reliable bet with a huge boom on the horizon.

# KEY POINTS

* SIMO is THE BEST way to play memory
* Under the radar stock in the memory supply chain, a derivative play with massive upside
* MU makes up 25% of revenues, followed by other major memory & semi companies; recovery = SIMO alchemy

# Company Description

Silicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power data centers, mobile devices, SSDs, autos, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMO’s products. Micron accounts for 25% of SIMO's revenues.

# Thesis

SIMO is significantly undervalued at current levels, getting caught in the indiscriminate market-wide selling over Q1 that has brought semis in to bottom barrel valuations.

This has created an AMAZING opportunity to not only double dip, but also enjoy even stronger tailwinds from even better fundamentals than we had in Q4!

I want to expedite the delivery of this DD, and I'll be beefing this section up throughout the day. For now, let me reiterate my Q4 investment thesis:

This is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering).

What do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off.

post,tklbaw,,V2G Tech Bridging The Gap Between EV and Diesel Cost In an Untapped Market,"Full disclosure: I retained a small position in $PTRA in my Roth IRA. Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor. Do your own DD as always.

I want to start a discussion on **V2G** as I think it has reached the turning point in commercialization of V2G tech and its unique but perfect marriage with electric school bus.

&#x200B;

**What is V2G:**

V2G or Vehicle-to-Grid is using electric vehicle specially equipped with bidirectional charging to take energy from the grid when the cost is low such as overnight and selling the energy back to the grid during peak hours when the electric cost is highest. It is important that the EV has a lot of energy left, ie: short routes and mostly unused hours/days. School buses have short routes, spend most of the day not in use and have many months without service particularly in the Summer assuming 180 days in a typical school year. Most electric vehicles can't do V2G. For example, not only my Tesla can't do bidirectional charging due to limitation, even if it could there just isn't enough 'juice' left to sell back to the grid at the end of the day because of high mileage.

&#x200B;

**Successful use of V2G in commercial settings:**

Thomas Built Buses just announced a [long term agreement](https://electrek.co/2022/03/18/electric-school-buses-are-reaching-cost-parity-with-diesel-and-a-california-district-will-deploy-one-of-the-largest-e-bus-fleets-in-the-state/) to 2025 with Highland Electric to sell a fleet of the electric bus Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley powered by Proterra's 226kWh battery and drivetrain. The 226kWh battery is the largest in the industry for school buses and has the capacity that is more than 16 times that of a Tesla Powerwall battery. This agreement is expanding on their previous fleet order of 326 electric bus in February of 2021 after Highland spent the past year successfully confirming that it is profitable using V2G on the Jouley electric school bus.",8238,True,1648007482.0,2022-03-23 04:51:22,1,3,GrandmasterKane,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tklbaw/v2g_tech_bridging_the_gap_between_ev_and_diesel/,True,0.67,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,ttbqoj,,The Electre SUV might actually be a great Lotus.,"Wait, hear me out! I can explain!

We all know that Lotus, as a car brand, stands for very specific things. The mantra of “simplify, then add lightness” is beyond legendary. Lotus never stood for gigantic amounts of power and torque; straight line speed was never quite their thing as much as handling was (I know I'm ignoring things such as the Lotus Carlton but please focus on the point I am trying to make). Over the years Lotus developed a reputation for flawless handling, which was the result of perfect chassis balance, beautiful suspension, amazingly communicative steering, innovative ideas, and a relentless search for lightness. So, when a few years ago Lotus decided to introduce the Evija, people rightfully expressed concerns as to whether that car truly followed the ethos of what Lotus represents. After roll a 3000lb+, 2000hp monster machine doesn't really sound like something Lotus would do. And now, horror of horrors, Lotus is building a 2 tonne, 600-1000hp electric SUV. This is something that will cause many to be inclined to think that Lotus has lost its way. 

However, I do not think that is right:

Many think of the Evija, as a heavy car unworthy of bearing the Lotus name plate. But I think that is a big mistake. See, the Evija might weigh twice as much as an Elise, but it is in fact astonishingly light. In fact, compared to other EV hypercars it is an absolute featherweight. Take the Rimac Nevera, its closest competitor: that car is 400 kg heavier than the Lotus. The idea that Lotus managed to build a car with that big a battery, that much power, which weighs so little, AND is road legal is absolutely incredible. With four-wheel torque vectoring, perfect chassis balance, incredible aerodynamics, and an advanced suspension system, that car is a technological tour de force that strives, in true Lotus fashion, to be as light as possible. If that doesn't sound like Lotus to you, I do not know what does.",3658,True,1648766348.0,2022-04-01 00:39:08,2,5,The_Dyff,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/ttbqoj/the_electre_suv_might_actually_be_a_great_lotus/,True,0.53,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Hertz said Polestar cars would be available beginning this spring in Europe and later in 2022 in North America and Australia.

The Florida-based rental car company said that it would initially order the Polestar 2 sedan. Hertz shares were up 1.75% in premarket trading Monday.

Hertz in October announced its order to purchase 100,000 electric cars from Tesla Inc, primarily the EV maker's Model 3.

Polestar, which was founded by China's Geely and Volvo Cars, is set to merge with special purpose acquisition company: Gores Guggenheim Inc, this year.

The Hertz partnership ""will bring the amazing experience of driving an electric car to a wider audience, satisfying a broad variety of our mutual customers' short- and longer-term mobility requirements,"" Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said in a statement.

On 28 June 2021, Bloomberg reported that for the first time in the history of the humankind, a human was fired by a machine (or, rather, by an algorithm). It was Amazon’s driver who, as the algorithm concluded, hadn’t met his targets. The algorithm wished the driver all the best. 

If you want to sell your products on Amazon, you probably won’t need to negotiate with a human being. In Amazon they have built an effective system where algorithms handle all the processes for merchants. You need to follow the instructions, and soon your products will be on Amazon’s virtual showcase shelf. But Amazon's case is an exception so far, and dealing with less digitalized companies will involve good old human-to-human interactions.

When I lecture in business schools, and when it comes to customers' needs topic, I am often asked the same question: ""Does the word ""needs"" make any sense in B2B industries? Isn't it only about the B2C world? Shouldn’t we replace the word “needs” with “requirements”?”. A direct comparison of two purchasing approaches – an ordinary person buying a smartphone or a car and a professional procurement manager ordering cold-rolled steel or chips for their plant – looks bizarre. But that's only at first glance.

If you or your employees negotiate with a customer, and if this customer is an official representing a company, it is still a human-to-human (H2H) interaction. Your counterpart is a human being, and they can stop being one even on duty. People can’t leave their personalities outside the office’s door. On the one hand, they are financial managers, sales representatives, and top executives. On the other hand, they are women and men with fears, superstitions, dreams, and hopes.

post,u8ka1h,,On Tesla's valuation (Part Deux),"Five months ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/), breaking down Tesla's hotly debated valuation to determine whether it's really as cheap as Tesla bulls say, or as expensive as most of the rest of the sub thinks it is.

After yesterday's earnings report, it seems like my analysis has already been proven incorrect, and I felt it would be worth having another look at it.

For those who don't like reading, I will again explain how I got to my numbers. If you don't like reading, skip straight to ""The Numbers""

------------------------------

**The method**

While trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap might rise slightly higher today, let's use a market cap of $1T to determine if Tesla really deserves to be a trillion dollar company.

------------------------------

**The trends**

In terms of revenue (TTM), Tesla had grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021 in my last analysis. After Q1, that has grown to $62,190M, with Q1 being a 87% YoY increase.

In terms of operating margin, Tesla had grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021. After Q1, that has grown to 19.2%, equalling market leader Ferrari.

In terms of GAAP net income (TTM), Tesla had grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,468M after Q3 2021. After Q1, this has grown to $8,399M, with Q1 being a 658% YoY increased.

------------------------------

**The future**

Last time, I said the following:

> Obviously Tesla won't be able to maintain such a high growth rate. The net income figure is heavily distorted by their low profitability in 2020, and their margins may suffer somewhat as they start to ramp up the two new factories that they are building.",8827,True,1650536252.0,2022-04-21 12:17:32,48,111,Ehralur,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8ka1h/on_teslas_valuation_part_deux/,True,0.85,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Remember, how it was proven that the news lied? Lets go Brandon is the exposure of a lie that a CNN reporter said at a NASCAR race... CNN news reporters are taught to lie as a way of spinning the news. We know this, everyone knows this.

Remember how the news censor?  For a while, even some of my family didn't know of how massive liberal anti Christian censorship and discrimination is rampant.  I'm one of the literal best software engineers on Earth and worked on the first self driving cars at CMU, remember I coded since I was 4?  The reason I never got hired has nothing to do with my skill.  It's 100% discrimination against Christians by liberals who's crony culture embraces atheism and fight against the notion of God.  They think they're keeping secrets by censoring, nah, but it took a while for everyone to find out what I knew in 2018..

We ALL know the news lies by now. We ALL know they censor, and if you don't it can be easily proven to you and we can catch you up to speed.  So the conclusion is: If you accept the evil that the news lies to you, and you accept the evil that they censor you: Why do you let them tell you nothing goes on in secret that they don't tell you about?  There's more evils than censorship and lying going on. They use the tools of censorship and lying to keep it hidden... So Elon Musk buying Twitter and letting Christians speak again is awwweeeesome! Let freedom of speech be real again!

The censorship stories I had that sounded absurd to some of you, but are quite real. I wouldn't lie. I love the truth, but corrupt news agencies with bribe money from foreign enemy nations would lie to you all day long.

post,udru31,,Customers’ needs and a b2b-portal,"About ten years ago, I was a CEO of a plant. We sold our products to distributors, and there were more than 90 of them in several countries. They sent us orders the way they preferred – by email, fax (yes, we had to keep an old fax machine in the office), phone, or even SMS. A small army of clerks worked in the spacious open space in our office. They received the orders, registered them, and converted them into the form fitted for our ERP system. They also kept the distributors informed about everything concerning their orders. Every time I signed an annual payroll, my heart bled – so much work without any visible added value! 

And then our IT department built up a b2b online portal for the distributors. Since then, they could log in to their personal account and see the statuses of the placed orders, place a new one, reconcile their debts, receive additional information on the products, etc. We presented this hi-tech solution to the distributors in a solemn ceremony, with champaign and oysters, and it seemed to me that they were impressed – at least, they nodded and shook my hand.

post,udtyqm,,"Why I’m long on long read DNA sequencing ($PACB, LON:$ONT)","I work in the biotech field and want to lay out why the 2022 biotech sell-off has created an unparalleled opportunity to buy cheaply into technology leaders in a growing field. Specifically, I want to talk about two companies involved in DNA sequencing: the US-listed Pacific Biosciences ($PACB) and the UK-listed Oxford Nanopore Technologies (LON:$ONT). These are household names for people working in biotech but not widely known outside of the field. I will refer to them as PacBio and ONT in the main text below.

**TL;DR:** PacBio and ONT are significantly undervalued leaders in long read DNA sequencing. Together they hold a duopoly in the long read sequencing market, with sizable technology-based moats that even the sequencing Goliath Illumina ($ILMN) with 80% market share has never been able to overcome. In the last 6 months, PacBio has lost 80% of its value and ONT has lost 45% of its value, providing excellent entry points. Bucking the stock price decline, in 2021, revenues grew 65% for PacBio and 94% for ONT as these companies scale up. Together PacBio and ONT own less than a 10% share of the DNA sequencing market, which is currently worth $5.8B. But both their market share as well as the total addressable market are likely to grow rapidly over the next ten years. Going long on PacBio and ONT therefore has a high probability of yielding a 10X return on investment.

# What is DNA sequencing?

For those who went to school before the Human Genome Project started in 1990 and those who forgot their high school biology, DNA sequencing is the process of reading out the nucleic acid sequence of a molecule of DNA. You know that stuff inside all of our cells which encodes our genetic blueprint. Importantly, this DNA is rich in valuable information. Some of the most important types of information we can extract from DNA sequence are:

* genetic mutations that contribute to disease like cancer and other traits
* genetic relationships to other sequences (i.e.",24432,True,1651149297.0,2022-04-28 14:34:57,147,81,WorldFamousAstronaut,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/udtyqm/why_im_long_on_long_read_dna_sequencing_pacb/,True,0.86,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,uk7b5v,,What Virgin Galactic (SPCE) needs to do to actually become a successful space tourism company,"Lets face it, Richard Branson is not good at building a manufacturing/engineering company. Its been almost 20 years since SpaceShipOne first flew, and yet VG only has *one* operational vehicle, VSS Unity, in 2022. Imagine SpaceX, which was founded in 2002, had only manufactured one Falcon 9 since its creation. How does anyone expect VG to be successful when they have clearly, and repeatedly shown, that they are horrible at manufacturing?

What is Richard Branson known for and good at? Branson is a genius when it comes to branding and providing luxurious experiences. This is his gift. He isn't Elon Musk, and he quite clearly isn't able to attract the engineering talent needed to scale manufacturing as is needed like Elon can.

So how can Branson and VG as a whole actually create a successful business model? Instead of being a space ship manufacturing company *and* a space tourism company, they need to become just a space tourism company. For an example, airlines like Delta, United, Southwest, etc. don't manufacture the planes they operate. They purchase or lease them from Boeing and Airbus. This wasn't always the case. Up until 1934, the manufacturing companies also provided airline services. Then, the US government forced these companies to separate these operations. You can read about it here:[ http://avstop.com/history/needregulations/act1934.htm](http://avstop.com/history/needregulations/act1934.htm).

Could we see this happen in the commercial space flight sector as well? Could SpaceX in the commercial space flight sector be the equivalent to what Boeing and Airbus are in the commercial air flight sector today? Could Virgin Galactic then be the equivalent to Delta airlines, United airlines, or its sister company, Virgin Atlantic?

How would this play out, exactly?

post,uric8y,,Idea behind Stock Compensation at Tech Firms," 

This is just a curious take of how does stock compensations really work from an employee and business owner stand point?

Looking at [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi/) the salaries are divided into 3 divisions: base, stock and bonus  
These are my assumption:

Base is given to employees after dividing it by 12 and paid monthly  
Bonus might be quarterly, biyearly or yearly  
And stock has a lock-in period for x number of months.

Considering Meta which has a payout of 25% for 4 years, does it indicate one can cash out at year end (or at the end of the month)?

What is the benefit of the company to issue shares instead of cash? Doesn't the employee have a lot to lose in case he/she switches companies, as the stock payout gets accumulated? Isnt the employee at loss in case the company goes through its downs, as he/she has control over its work and not in the success of the entire company, which is what he works for?  
Also how does company **GENERATE** those shares? Share is the proportional ownership of the company. During an FPO, the company issues new batch of shares **from the market** from retail, institutions and anchor investors? Where does the company generate the equity to pass it on to the employee?

Going by this article as Elon Musk too is an employee of a company [Here’s Why Elon Musk Was Really The Highest-Paid CEO In 2020 (forbes.com)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2021/05/06/elon-musk-made-billions-in-2020-every-other-ceo-made-millions/?sh=4e9d127d6f93) , it says ""In all, the pay package entitles Musk to options that will give him the right to buy a total of 101.2 million Tesla shares at a split-adjusted price of $70 per share.

post,v1ar13,,Rented an EV6 - comparing it to my Model 3,"I rented a Kia EV6 long range RWD (Wind edition I think) off of turo since my tesla model 3 is STILL at the service center (12 days and counting) and I wasn't given a loaner or rental credits.

Overall I'm extremely impressed with the Kia.  Its build quality and road noise levels are FAR superior to my tesla model 3.  Even though it wasn't the GT line, it was still very quick and fun.  It felt bigger than my model 3 for sure, and harder to tell where the corners of the car were, but perhaps I'd get used to that over time.  Feels more like you're in an SUV than it looks in photos.

Its driver assist tech is almost as good as autopilot.  Its navigation system is not as good as tesla's, but apple carplay helps solve that. 

It seems like tesla achieves their range advantage by really skimping on noise insulation and materials.  After experiencing the Kia, I think I prefer a quieter ride and a little less range.  The kia also is much more forgiving on rough pavement, which is most of america, but still felt very sporty.

The main area that my tesla is far better is  - driving position.  I'm 5'9"" and if I put the EV6's wheel in a comfortable place, it completely blocks all the info in the instrument cluster and all I can see is the useless car animation graphic.   In order to see all the important info, I'd have to raise the wheel up to a goofy high level like I'm driving a school bus.  This seems like such a massive design flaw and I can't believe it made it to production.  Reading others' reviews, it seems this is a huge problem for some owners, and no problem at all for others.

post,v290yl,,"CA to CT, 3100 miles in 5 days, for $120: first big EV road trip","**Quick stats**

* '22 Model 3 LR AWD, Aero wheels
* 3100 miles \* 227 Wh / mi = 704 kWh
* \~50% DC fast charging, \~50% free Level 2 charging
* DC fast charging \~350 kWh at $.34 / kWh = $120 ($0.038 / mi)
* \~65 mph average speed, around 10h per day driving

&#x200B;

**Overview**

I've crossed the country more times than I can remember, but this was my first time doing so in an EV. And it was awesome! High flight prices inspired me to see how little I could spend while still completing the drive in 5 days (about as fast as I'd typically do it solo).

Essentially, this ended up forming the question: If I knew I had access to e.g. an 8 kW free charger for the whole route, how many miles could I drive in a day, and what was the optimal speed for getting the most out of BOTH charging and driving? Many python scripts later, and I found that charging on average 16 kW and driving 65 - 70 mph would allow me to cover 750 miles per day, more than enough to get me coast to coast in 5 days.

As an aside, if your road trip involves days with <400 mi driving, it's not so difficult to drive for free indefinitely with the right car, assuming you can find decent free chargers.

**Method**

I drove around 10 hours per day and followed the ABCs of EV road trips when not driving: always be charging. So where, when, and for how long?

* Make certain that you can charge overnight. Arrive on a low battery, leave with a full one, and try not to sit idle for longer than necessary.
* Finding a fast free charger (>10 kW in my case) meant I tried to stick around as long as I reasonably could. Grab food, maybe nap, go for a walk, etc. Unless you're driving 16 hours per day, you'll have to stop anyway and might as well do so optimally.
* Try to optimize where cheap DC fast chargers are with where you can charge for free. Gas prices are mostly consistent within a few hundred miles, but DC charger rates can vary by 50% or more. Don't get stuck paying $0.",4528,True,1654059317.0,2022-06-01 06:55:17,34,13,TheMagic1415926535,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/v290yl/ca_to_ct_3100_miles_in_5_days_for_120_first_big/,True,0.86,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,vm3djk,,"Ford’s MachE – a examination of Tesla’s competition, with $TSLA implications","
TL/DR upfront:

Upcoming EV competition is *the* driving DD behind the Tesla bear narrative: that EV competition will show up à market competition will drive EV prices (and therefore $TSLA margins) down to industry-norms. I think this reasoning is flawed. Ford’s unprofitability with the MachE provides a window into what the competition is facing, and why Tesla is *very likely* to retain supply capped demand and see robust gross margin growth--insulated from the effects of market competition—for several years (until \~ 2026-2028). 

\---- 

Argument:

**Fords issues with EV profitabili**ty (link:  [Ford CFO says inflation has erased Mustang Mach-E profits, but isn't hurting demand (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/ford-cfo-says-inflation-has-erased-mustang-mach-e-profits-but-isnt-hurting-demand.html) ) i**s a** **PROXY** **for legacy auto’s outlook writ large.** 

Ford’s ‘Tesla Killer’ is their Mach E, which is a BEV (full battery) crossover SUV. However, recently Ford announced that they get zero profit from sales of their Mach E. Price information is below. 

* The ‘Standard Range’ RWD (68kwh battery, 230 miles EPA range, the lowest $ base model) is $42,895 before dealer markups and delivery fees
* The ‘Extended Range’ (88kwh, 300 miles EPA, the lowest $ long range model) is $52,000 before dealer/delivery

Fords lack of Mach-E profitability is VERY interesting because the car is highly priced while also benefiting from several cost-lowering factors:

* $7,500 U.S. federal EV subsidy (Ford has yet to hit the 200,000 vehicle cap for the $7500, at which point it gradually decreases). Tesla buyers do not qualify for any EV tax credits right now. 
* Made in Mexico with cheaper, non-unionized labor 
* Usage of large pouch-style batteries, which are cheaper but lower-quality
* A more battery-efficient Car form-factor (as compared to a truck), meaning less batteries for a desired range and, therefore, lower cost of production.",6637,True,1656357248.0,2022-06-27 21:14:08,503,492,IS_JOKE_COMRADE,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/vm3djk/fords_mache_a_examination_of_teslas_competition/,True,0.79,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,vnxe9o,,TSLA seems to be priced fairly right now,"Apologies for making yet another tesla post but I feel like this is worth discussing.

At the time of writing this post TSLA is worth $685.47 with a market cap of $710B. I don't own any shares of Tesla at all. 

My claim is that at this price and point in time the stock seems to be priced fairly and arguably is a pretty decent buy.  

My reasoning: 

1. Extreme growth: They have a 51% revenue CAGR starting with the realease of the model s in 2013 up until last year. This year they will probably have another 50% growth and <<probably>> another 50% in 2023. The point is that so far over the long run TSLA has grown extremely quickly and consistently. They will also have new models such as Semi, cybertruck and roadster arriving <<probably>> next year. AND they sell their cars with excellent margins. So their growth is very sustainable. 
2. Diverse and unique side businesses: As of this moment tesla gets the vast majority of its revenue and profit from selling cars, thats undeniable. But they have a lot of aspirations. Firstly, energy storage is going to be cruicial in transitioning the world to sustainable energy and tesla is at the forefront of this industry and are therefore in a prime position to capitalize on that. Secondly tesla is dabbling with insurance and juding by their lates report that business unit seems to be breaking even and soon will become profitable. It has only launched in a few states so far and there is a lot of room to grow. Solar shignles and solar in general is also another potential area for growth although tesla doesn't seem to be prioritizing it.  
3. Autonomy: Elon has many times over estimated his own timelines so this point is a little weak BUT if tesla does indeed manage to actually get FSD working properly (im guessing 2025 is the year where they start driving tens of thousands of kilometers without any issues) then tesla is poised to make a ridiculous amount of money.",3838,True,1656556752.0,2022-06-30 04:39:12,0,69,Mr_Axelg,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vnxe9o/tsla_seems_to_be_priced_fairly_right_now/,True,0.29,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

I'm not sure exactly what number to cherrypick from what report to get the conversation started here.

Obviously, most of us are not professional analysts, so we are pretty far from ""the best person for the job"" when it comes to giving an educated opinion on such a robust economic topic.

2021 earnings: 208.49

2022 earnings estimate: 225

2023 earnings estimate: 240

Why are S&P earnings estimated to grow 8% from 2021 -> 2022, and 6.66% 2022 -> 2023? If markets are forward looking... why does it feel like there's still a bit of wiggle room for future earnings estimates to be adjusted downwards? Why are markets being optimistic instead of pessimistic?

I pulled up the top 100 companies of the S&P by earnings TTM (not EPS, EPS * # shares outstanding). Top 100 companies make up 65% of the market cap and 73% of the earnings for the S&P500

post,vs6eou,,Short term review of IONIQ 5 SE RWD and comparison with Model 3 & Y,"TL;DR : 8/10 Car, competitive with Tesla offerings but also some very mind baffling design decisions. Good buy if $5K cheaper than Model 3.

My wife got a ridiculously good early lease return offer for her 2020 Leaf SV so we took it. She did need another car, and we decided to take advantage of the federal EV tax credit as well as CVRP to get an IONIQ 5. Note that if these were not available (Tesla is eligible for neither now) or if Tesla had no wait time, we probably would have just bought a Model 3 SR+. We currently still own a 2021 Model Y LR, previously owned a 2018 Model 3 LR RWD, and have driven a 2017 Model S 75D quite a bit as well as the Leaf we just returned and have test driven most of the other EV offerings out there, so we have a broad range of EV experience.

MSRP was 45K, with a 4k markup and a 3K mandatory service contract for a total of 53K+Tax. We will get 9.5K back in tax credits and rebates for an effective price of 44K. Dealers playing games made the overall experience annoying after being spoiled by one button ordering with Tesla.

Driving and Handling 9/10:

I'm not going to compare 0-60 to the Model Y AWD as that would be unfair. Compared to the Model 3 RWD, the initial throttle is much more gentle, with more progression in the mid and end throttle curve. The Ioniq is more gentle and comfortable especially for family and passengers, at the cost of responsiveness, even in the ""sport"" driving setting. The Ioniq breaks traction easier when accelerating.

The suspension on the Ioniq however is much softer and easier on bumps than the Y.  This is one of the biggest complaints on 3/Ys and I think the comfort outweighs the loss in responsiveness. Minimum turning radius is much tighter than the Y.

At max strength, regenerative braking is stronger than on the Leaf and weaker than on a Tesla. So the stopping distance and comfort when using only regen to brake is nice middle ground.",9889,True,1657050423.0,2022-07-05 21:47:03,23,69,EuthanizeArty,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/vs6eou/short_term_review_of_ioniq_5_se_rwd_and/,True,0.73,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,w19mwb,,Twitter's filing in Delaware court shows Musk was actively sabotaging Twitter's business and the acquisition deal,"[The filing](https://www.wlrk.com/docs/76660099_Final-Verified-Complaint.pdf)  is a profile of Musk's MO: he's impulsive, petulant, and bullying; he  reneges on his word constantly; and uses his money & power to get  what he wants. Unfortunately for him, [Bret Taylor](https://twitter.com/btaylor/status/1546965769983889409) and Twitter's lawyers have an airtight contract which Musk (typically)  signed back in April without much thought. And despite repeated,  flagrant violations of the agreement by Musk over the next 3 months,  Twitter has abided by it. So Elon is now up shit creek without a  baguette.

Highlights:

* *""On  April 25, 2022, Musk\[\] agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in  cash, for a total of about $44 billion. That price, presented by Musk on  a take-it-or-leave-it basis in an unsolicited public offer, represented  a 38% premium over Twitter’s unaffected share price. The other terms  Musk offered and agreed to were, as he touted, “seller friendly.” There  is no financing contingency and no diligence condition. The deal is  backed by airtight debt and equity commitments. Musk has personally  committed $33.5 billion.""* (Sections 3, 4) In other words, he threw  money at Twitter, and was so confident of winning that he signed the  deal without doing any due diligence and basically guaranteeing the  financing himself.
* *""Musk’s  exit strategy is a model of hypocrisy. One of the chief reasons Musk  cited\[\] for wanting to buy Twitter was to rid it of the “\[c\]rypto spam”  he viewed as a “major blight on the user experience.” But when the  market declined and the fixed-price deal became less attractive, Musk  shifted his narrative, suddenly demanding “verification” that spam was  not a serious problem on Twitter’s platform, and claiming a burning need  to conduct “diligence” he had expressly forsworn.""* (Section 7) Due diligence is a process you do before entering into a contract not after.

post,w2yhd9,,Tesla vs WeWork,"Just finished watching the Hulu WeWork documentary, and throughout the entire film, all I could think was ""How is Tesla not just like WeWork??"" The parallels between the two are a lot in my opinion. 

Summarizing real quick and briefly the WeWork documentary:

- Adam shows up in 2010 after the financial crisis. This was a time when people were being a bit greedy, betting on Tech companies a lot of money in hopes of incredible returns or finding that next ""unicorn"". 
- Adam uses his charisma to ensnare people into working for him and investing in his dream, a ""revolution in the workplace"" that would ""forever change the human interaction"" when it comes to business and maybe even societal expectations about work / life balance. Telling people that everyone is a ""creator"" and all this other spiritual stuff. 
- WeWork had a fairly straightforward business model. The company would sign long-term leases on office space (from Adam after he purchased the buildings himself) subdivide it into smaller work areas, and then rent those out to freelancers or small businesses on a short-term basis. 
- The innovation here was the different way of presenting work space to people - changing the overall aesthetic. That is it!! 
- WeWork uses all types of tactics (gets attractive young people, booze, free snacks in offices, the inspirational mantras, etc...) to entice people to work for them or open their offices in WeWork locations, or invest in the company. Adam essentially creates a cult of personality around him, being all about “bringing people together” in the “spirit of We."" He cashed in the fact that many people are looking for ""purpose"" in life. 
- Adam Neumann insisted that WeWork was going to be huge, and it had something to do with technology. “So we’re definitely not a real-estate company,” he said to a skeptical television interviewer. “We are a community of creators” who “leverage technology to connect people. . . . And it’s a new way of working.",4811,True,1658252127.0,2022-07-19 19:35:27,0,51,SilentBob890,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w2yhd9/tesla_vs_wework/,True,0.5,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

post,w56glz,,Tesla Earnings - some perspective,"Tesla rallied 10% yeterday, post earnings. A move we have not seen in a while. Tesla long held the mantle of poster boy in the US 2020/21 tech rally, fanned my the biggest monetary expansion in history. Does its rally herald a comeback in tech, or is it one last dead cat bounce for the most over-hyped and over-priced stock in history?

To be fair to Tesla, there was some mis-reporting of Free Cash Flows being negative without its BitCoin sales. Not true (FCF = Operating Cash Flows - Cap-Ex), so the $621 million free cash flow was true, the BTC sale an investment cash flow. That said, the $0.8 billion reported net change in cash would have been negative without the BTC sale - which of course saw some loss of credibility to Musk given previous comments on the subject.

Perhaps a better understanding of the motivation for that decision on cash by its CEO and CFO can be helped by seeing the fall in free cash flows:

3Q21: $1,328M, 4Q21: $2,775M, 1Q22: $2,228, 2Q22: $621 

On a quarterly and trailing 12 month basis, Tesla announced:

**Revenues of $16.93 billion ($67.166 billion, 12 month ttv)**

**Net (GAAP) profits of $2.259 billion ($9.516 billion, 12 month ttv)**

**Free Cash Flow of $621 million ($6.952 billion, 12 month ttv)**

Tesla trades then at:

**13 x Price to sales;**

**89 x Price to earnings;**

**122 x Price to FCF**

Heady numbers, but Tesla is of course a growth stock and all about its future earnings potential in EV cars, semis, pick-ups, robo-taxis, business to business/customer tech sales, battery sales and artificial intelligence. Lets take a look at those areas vs its competitors...

China and Europe's large automobile markets (26 and 12 million sales in 2021) now have 1 in 5 cars sold as plug-ins (BEV/PHEV's) unlike the US mkt still showing only 1 in 20 EV sales from the 15 million vehicles sold in 2021. Tesla of course dominates US EV sales. It no longer does global markets outside of the US.",5665,True,1658483094.0,2022-07-22 11:44:54,4,0,Historical_Job_8609,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w56glz/tesla_earnings_some_perspective/,True,0.75,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

post,w6gig3,,"""79% of U.S. buyers would only buy a car if it supported CarPlay""","If this is true, then Apple is about to make a crap-ton of money. Some points from the [CNBC article](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/22/apple-carplay-could-be-a-trojan-horse-into-the-automotive-industry.html) where I found this stat:

* Apple engineering manager Emily Schubert said 98% of new cars in the U.S. come with CarPlay installed. She delivered a shocking stat: 79% of U.S. buyers would only buy a car if it supported CarPlay.

* The auto industry faces an unappealing choice: Offer CarPlay and give up potential revenue and the chance to ride a major industry shift, or spend heavily to develop their own infotainment software and cater to an potentially shrinking audience of car buyers who will purchase a new vehicle without CarPlay.

* GM, which wasn’t listed on Apple’s slide, already gets revenue of $2 billion per year from in-car subscriptions and expects it to grow to **$25 billion per year by 2030**. 

* Tesla, which doesn’t support CarPlay, recently shifted into selling its “FSD” driver-assistance features, including auto-parking and lane-keeping, as a subscription that costs as much $199 per month.

* The next generation of CarPlay will need significant buy-in from automakers to give Apple’s software access to core systems. Apple suggested it secured cooperation from several major carmakers.

* In June, Apple revealed that it has explored features that integrate commerce into the car’s cockpit. One new feature announced this summer would allow CarPlay users to navigate to a gas pump and pay for the fuel from the dashboard of the car, according to Reuters.

This sounds like an incredible source of revenue. Of course there will be a lot of push back from car manufacturers who obviously want to keep this revenue to themselves. But Apple has the advantage of offering with integrations such as:

* iPhone obviously.
* Watch, which I believe will be a lot more popular in the future as more advanced healthcare capabilities are added to it.

post,wayz3g,,The Fed vowed to crush inflation with higher rates. Then the stock market rallied. Here’s why. (It’s not good news)- Interesting read," The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by another 75 basis points despite acknowledging that economic growth is clearly slowing. The central bank, under Powell, reiterated that the path of least resistance is well-represented by the so-called dot plot: More hikes ahead — all the way to a fed funds rate of 3.75%!

And yet, the stock market has staged a humongous rally, led by the most valuation-sensitive and risk-sentiment-driven asset classes: Nasdaq stocks **COMP,** **+1.08%** and crypto.

**So … what the heck?!**

It all boils down to how one single sentence was able to affect the probability distributions that investors were projecting for different asset classes.  
Does it sound complicated? Bear with me: it’s not!

**Why did stocks rally?**

When the FOMC’s press release was published, it looked like business as usual: A well-telegraphed 75-bp hike with the only small surprise represented by an unanimous vote despite clear acknowledgment that economic growth is softening.

But not even 15 minutes into the press conference, the fireworks went off!  
In particular, when Powell said: ‘‘We are now at levels broadly in line with our estimates of neutral interest rates, and after front-loading our hiking cycle until now we will be much more data-dependent going forward.’’

 **This is very important for several reasons-**

The neutral rate is the prevailing rate at which the economy delivers its potential GDP growth rate — without overheating or excessively cooling down. With this 75-bp hike, Powell told us the Fed just reached its estimate of a neutral rate and, hence, from here they aren’t contributing to economic overheating anymore. But that also means any further increases are going to put the Fed in an actively restrictive territory. And the bond market knows that every time the Fed became restrictive in the past, they ended up breaking something.",4424,True,1659082069.0,2022-07-29 10:07:49,431,164,Johnblr,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/wayz3g/the_fed_vowed_to_crush_inflation_with_higher/,True,0.9,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,wfflk9,,Launch Control is still silly. I updated my sorted list of 5-60mph times to better reflect cars' real life acceleration performance.,"It's been more than a year since I did [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/i6qdmx/launch_control_is_silly_i_compiled_and_sorted_a/). Since then many new cars have come out and I thought it's appropriate for me to update the test a little.

For context, many popular magazines that do 0-60 tests on new vehicles measure them with the use of launch control. This mostly eliminates the effect of turbo lag, throttle delay and power delivery curve difference for many high performance cars that would all make significant differences in real life situations. Further more many American magazines subtract rollout time from their 0-60 result, which further downplays the difference in traction between different setups.

Which is why Car and Driver's 5-60 time is in my opinion the most accurate gauge of real life ""stomp-and-go"" acceleration scenario. So here is the updated list, with one additional column at the end (+x.xs) for some cars showing the discrepancy between the 0-60 and the 5-60 time. The larger this gap is the less representative is the car's 0-60 number of its real life capability. 

I've also removed cars from the previous list if there are newer models available.

Bolded entries are new ones added this time.

Summarized version; car auction purchase = apocalyptic disaster. 



Extended Version;

I like to frequent a semi-local (2 hour drive away) online auto auction house that specializes in selling bank/credit union repossessions. 

As you can imagine, most of these vehicles are a) American and b) not cared for. Chances are if someone financed a 2009 Chevy Equinox, the likelihood that they are well off financially is pretty low. Chevy Equinox indeed; most of the vehicles on here are undesirables. But every once in a while you come across a diamond in the rough, or so I thought would be... 

One Tuesday evening, I happened across one of my ""to own"" bucket list. You know, that list of cars you always wanted over the years but never found an opportunity to buy for cheap. Well, here I am; on that list is a 5 Cylinder powered Volkswagen Jetta, I had preferred a Sportwagen but realistically I had no need for one as I currently also own a Nissan Pathfinder, so I could get a sedan and give it daily driver status. 

The auction had a few hours left, and I pondered for about... 12 Seconds.

""$3000 is my Maximum Bid"" I said (to nobody but still out loud for reasons beyond comprehension), if it goes for more than that I won't increase. I place my bid and promptly... go do something else and completely forget that I even bid for a car that evening.

I wake up the next morning and start my routine, your typical dash for the coffee maker and creamer as the required morning pick me up. I sit at my kitchen cable, half eyed, staring at my phone screen, sifting through the junk mail and typical things I signed up for but didn’t actually sign up for.

“Congratulations! You’re the high bidder!”

post,wuwujv,,Chevy Bolt - Good Dealer Experince,"There are so many negative posts about dealers that I thought yoiu might enjoy hearing a good story. 

 I have a 2021 Tesla MY and my wife was driving a 2018 CR-V with 40,000 miles on it. We started wondering about the resale value and going all electric. On July 10, we checked the CR-V value at [webuyanycar.com](http://webuyanycar.com/) and seeing a $27,000 valuation (we paid $33,500 new), decided it was time. Given good press for the Bolt, the price reduction, and our need for a car for errands and short trips, we decided to start there. We do frequently road trip from Philadelphia to Daytona, but we always use the Tesla for that anyway (autopilot is a gamechanger on long trips). 

We visited Armen Chevrolet in Ardmore, PA, close to our house. They didn't have any Bolt's to test drive (we were not surprised) but they did have a 2022 at their service location and we were able to get in and play with the infotainment system. That car was awaiting the battery replacement so they would not let us go anywhere. The deal they offered was straight forward. Price is MRSP. Put down a $500 refundable deposit and he will call when they ""get an allocation.""  We spent just a few minutes on the configuration: Red, LT-2 adding adaptive cruise, L2 charger, and floor mats for a total of $30,885, including $995 destination charge. The salesperson was very nice, not at all ""salesy"", and he said we're looking at October/November. 

Later that day we went to Pizzaro Nissan nearby.  The Nissan dealer was playing games with the Leaf with a $12,000 non-optional ""value package."" They had no Leaf of any trim to even look at. He also did call back when I called with a question. 

We then went to CarMax and sold the CR-V (we don't need two cars for the next few months) for $28,000! Still makes us wonder what we're missing. 

On 7/18, we called Armen and gave him our credit card. We checked back on on 8/18 and the salesperson told us we're #3 and ""October-ish is still good.",2185,True,1661182610.0,2022-08-22 17:36:50,53,24,105BigDave,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/wuwujv/chevy_bolt_good_dealer_experince/,True,0.92,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,wx7vp2,,"Issues and service experience with Tesla M3 after 10,000 km"," 

1. The front suspension is as noisy on uneven roads as a car with over 100,000 km. Tesla service says that they've changed the necessary parts, but the sound is still there.
2. There was a rattling noise from both seatbelt adjustment knobs on the b-pillars. Again, parts are changed, but the issue is still there.
3. The seatbelt alarm goes off in the back seats, even with empty child seats. This is a recent issue; I didn't have a problem with the same seats initially. Tesla service said they had tested it and didn't see a problem. When I drove off from the service, I noticed that the seatbelt was buckled in by someone, so no wonder they didn't notice the problem.
4. If it's hot outside (above 30-35 deg. C), the memory function of the mirrors and car seats is entirely different from the saved settings and needs readjustment. The service couldn't test this as it's not as hot outside anymore.
5. I've lost the cellular reception entirely for a couple of hours a day (again, when it was hot outside). That's a real pain on a long road trip where you expect the route planner to find you the next supercharger. The service couldn't verify this.
6. Once during a supercharging session in the middle of nowhere, I went to the toilet, and when I returned, the phone key didn't work. Restarting the app didn't help. The only solution I found was the remote start from the app. Scary; don't forget your key cards.
7. There was an annoying rattling sound from the back seats as one of the covers was loose. The service guys fixed it, but now a new vibration appears whenever I accelerate.
8. The middle of the touchscreen makes a clicking noise if I touch it. It's a known issue; no fix is available yet.
9. When I used Autopilot, the car braked suddenly at least once every 100 km on a 2,800 km (only highway) road trip. In many cases, it wanted to slow down to a speed limit which did not (no longer?) exist.",3125,True,1661413399.0,2022-08-25 09:43:19,22,13,gbodis,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/wx7vp2/issues_and_service_experience_with_tesla_m3_after/,True,0.72,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Mr. Zatko alleges that:

* Twitter is in material noncompliance with both its obligations under a 2011 FTC consent decree and its general obligations under data privacy, unfair trade practice, and consumer protection laws and regulations;
* Twitter is uniquely vulnerable to systemic disruption resulting from data center failures or malicious actors, a fact which Twitter leadership (including its CEO) have ignored and sought to obfuscate;
* Twitter’s platform is built in significant part on the misappropriation and infringement of third party intellectual property; and
* Twitter acquiesced to demands made by the Indian government that its agents be hired by Twitter and given access to Twitter user information.

Basically, Elon's lawyers are contending that even if the court rejects his prior termination this NEW termination provides more than enough reason to terminate:

These allegations, if true, demonstrate that Twitter has breached the following provisions of the Merger Agreement, thereby giving the Musk Parties the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms as more fully described below.

Without map data/connectivity, FSD does not seem to work so well.  (I had a compilation video link showing beta tester's experiences, but the post got taken down - see below.)  Anyway, FSD was not working nearly as well without connection as it does with.

From Tesla:

""Added a new “deep lane guidance” module to the Vector Lanes neural network which fuses features extracted from the video streams with coarse map data, i.e. lane counts and lane connectivities. This architecture achieves a 44% lower error rate on lane topology compared to the previous model, enabling smoother control before lanes and their connectivities becomes visually apparent. This provides a way to make every Autopilot drive as good as someone driving their own commute, yet in a sufficiently general way that adapts for road changes.""

I'm thinking Elon is creating this Starlink feature just to ensure that FSD continues to work well after 10.69.

Also, I posted a link to my YouTube video showing how much worse FSD 10.69 works without data connectivity, but it got taken down.

post,x4d1g4,,"Poor reliability isn't the only issue with EV fast-charging. Even when working as intended, the current design of EV fast-charging in the US is not fit for universal adoption (including Tesla...","TLDR: If EVs are truly going to fully replace gas cars then recharging an EV should be as convenient, consistent, and fast (within reason) as refilling a gas car. With the current EV fast charging design, that won't happen. So the charging sites that we're deploying today will eventually be outdated. We should start future-proofing today so that we spend the resources on something that will still be useful in 40 years.  

First things first, this a US-centric post about DC Ultra-Fast Charging. Some of it will apply to other countries, but not all. This is not referring to Level 2 or fast charging in areas where you’re meant to spend significant time like the movie theater or shopping mall. I also don’t care about any of the excuses for why it is this way. “It costs too much”, “Peak demand charges”, “The technology isn’t there yet”. None of that is my concern. The message has been sent that EVs are the future, so I am simply pointing out how the design of fast charging needs to improve in order for ICE to truly become obsolete. One of the first things that I was taught as an Electrical Engineer was to ensure that my designs were as future-proof as possible. Obviously, this is difficult to do with an emerging technology like DC Fast-Chargers (DCFC), but when billions of dollars are being poured into the transition to EVs, we should be making every effort to ensure that the money spent today isn’t wasted on something that will be obsolete in a decade or two. If the US is serious about transitioning from ICE vehicles to EVs, then we need to ensure that charging is as easy and convenient as filling up with gas. I also am not here to talk about things like reliability, number of charge sites, location of sites, etc. I am trying to focus on what’s wrong with the sites when they’re working exactly as they were designed to.

post,x7de20,,Goldman Sachs Remains Bullish on Tesla After Meeting,"Electric vehicle maker, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is trading up in pre-market on Tuesday following a note by a Goldman Sachs analyst. The analyst reiterated a Buy rating and $333.33 price target on TSLA after meeting with the company’s VP of Investor Relations, Martin Viecha.

Tesla believes that consumers will increasingly move toward EVs, even as it is too soon to quantify the effects of the newly signed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The analyst believes that consumers will be attracted to electric vehicles in the same way they were attracted towards other technology inflections (e.g. CRT to LCD TVs, and feature phones to smartphones). However, the EV industry could be supply-constrained over the intermediate term as new battery/component supply and assembly take time to ramp up.

Software and services, especially FSD, remain a key focus for the company as they continue to develop software and services to monetize the growing installed base of connected vehicles. Tesla believes FSD is one of the most important efforts in this category, and the company is targeting a wide release of its beta software in North America this year.

The analyst wrote in his note that he believes that ""Tesla, given its leadership position in EVs (including its vertical integration and tight coupling of hardware and software, as well as its ecosystem of charging stations and brand), and its focus on clean transportation more broadly (given its solar and storage businesses) is well positioned to capitalize on the long-term shift to EVs. We expect Tesla to expand margins in the intermediate term as it ramps the important Model Y product as well as new factories in Berlin, Germany and Austin, Texas, and in the long-term as it increases its mix of software revenue.""

post,x8gkxr,,Retail concompetitive T-Bill auctions vs SGOV etf,"In the recent past, T-bills seemed pretty useless because they paid zero interest. Now they seem to be far better than savings accounts and money market accounts, and possibly outperforming bank CD's.

I'm going to ignore ""treasury direct"" so please consider it off topic.

There seem to be two remaining popular ways to get t-bill interest rate:

1. Buy T-Bills via a retail brokerage; seems like you have to use a ""non-competitive"" bid, which is basically a blind bid with a surprise interest rate ""discount"". 
2. Buy a t-bill ETF such as SGOV

What are the upsides for parking fiat between those two methods ?

My guess is the advantages are

T-bills:

* State Tax advantages for directly owning t-bills vs getting dividends via an ETF
* No expense ratio, so you get those last few basis points
* No risk of the price dropping like mad

ETF:

* works like autopilot so you dont have to manage it
* Not having aas much downtime for your fiat pile between t-bills when they expire till the next auction
* Can sell anytime with less overhead

One of us think revenue sharing model should be easy and 33% for everyone.

My opinion revenue sharing should be with paying for hours who working and after that payment of work force (whoever will spend hours at work in the kitchen, it may be also him) only after split balance after payroll between the three of us.  


I'm came up with title, design logo and web site, design menu, design flyers, design nameplate and other information/web promotion.  
Another dude create some wood work and came up with menu and kitchen staging with me, we are 2 cooks.  
Third guy took care of the paperwork and supply.  
Also we three together made repairs to the room and installed equipment.   


 This Third guy not a cook, so maybe he think responsibility for paper work and supply is more important than being in the kitchen all day he only agrees to be in the kitchen part-time for a few hours at a time.

post,xvg2gw,,Battery drain in Tesla vs Etron - any tips?,"So my 2022 Etron is currently in the shop and I’ve been using a rental 2022 Model Y LR for the past few weeks (which was the car I’d been considering instead, so it’s been fun to do a side by side comparison).

The Model Y has a bunch of fun tech (sentry mode, voice control, it’s super quick, etc) - but I’ve noticed a couple of things that were surprising:

1. Autopilot isn’t any better than lane keeping assist in my Etron.  (The car technically has FSD, but that doesn’t seem to be active - presume Hertz isn’t in the beta?).  The rental Kia’s I’ve had on vacation are better - so I’m curious where the Tesla hype is coming from (perhaps this car has cameras not radar)

2. Vampire drain in the Tesla is real and bad.  I can leave my Etron parked for ~weeks, and I won’t lose a single mile of range (which is good, because the range is admittedly pretty bad vs the Y).  The Tesla, on the other hand, dumps range while sitting in my driveway.

I *think* this is due to sentry mode - does anyone else experience this?

I ran a test on the Tesla and the sentry mode drain.
Last Thursday I charged it up to 90%.  Unplugged, drove it to the covered airport parking lot at SJC, and had ~85% battery remaining.  Turned off climate control, turned off cabin temperature protection but left on sentry mode.
Flew out for a few days, came back yesterday.  
Sentry mode picked up 3 things.
Battery had dropped to 56%.
So 29% drop in 4 days while stationary and “off” with sentry enabled.

\- Bring back radar, Vision SUCKS. Way more phantom braking events, and autopilot slows down in foggy conditions when with radar it did not. Also, radar would show cars in front of me 2 or 3 deep, now with vision, all I see is the one in front on my visualization screen. Although, vision seems to do a better job at lane-keeping. So, a hybrid radar/vision might be best. It’s so bad that I rarely use autopilot anymore because when I do, I’m always on edge, ready to unintentionally brake check someone at a moment’s notice. You know a function is badly designed when the user is incentivized to NOT use that function. One of the biggest reasons I and probably most people bought Tesla was because of autopilot, and now it’s degraded to the point of not using it. 

\- Implement a dumb cruise control that only keeps the speed constant like every other car. I don't want phantom braking and making people angry behind me who think I brake checked them, I don't want to slow down in foggy conditions or around curves, I don't want lane keeping, I don't want distance keeping, I don't want 85 MPH to be my top limit. I just want the speed kept constant as if I had my foot on the accelerator and nothing else. 

\- Allow switching of accelerations speeds by tapping the ""chill"" word, just like tapping the battery changes it from % to miles. Or have different driving profiles available at the tap of a button, like the M buttons on BMW M cars. I don’t want to change my entire Driver profile to do this. 

\- Fix the music UI where half the song's name and band can't be seen even though there is plenty of real estate in the music bar. Show the time/time remaining in the song instead of just having the status bar at the bottom.

post,y2h9ij,,Tesla Vision is a major regression on Model Y,"I realize this has been talked about a bit, but just wanted to share my experiences. I have an early 2020 Model Y with enhanced autopilot. I drive quite a bit for work and have put over 72k miles on my Model Y. I have autopilot engaged probably over 90% of the time because most of my driving is on the interstate. A few weeks ago I got the Tesla Vision update. Tesla Vision has provided no discernible advantage and has a lot of issues compared to the radar based system:

* Further follow distance. I am not sure why they haven't just renamed 2 to 1. It seems weird that it's not possible to set the follow distance to 1 under any conditions. 
* Speed limited to 85 mph. This is the one thing that doesn't really affect me as over 85 mph is considered reckless driving in my state.
* Automatic wipers required. My windshield was a bit dirty on the hour long drive home on a clear day yesterday, and the wipers refused to turn off. Tried cleaning with the washer fluid without success.
* Automatic high beams required. The automatic high beams work horribly while driving on the interstate. They are tripped up by the simplest things like highway signs. I am basically constantly flashing my high beams unless I am in heavy traffic (in which case they stay off). I am legitimately concerned the police are going to pull me over for this.
* Autopilot can no longer reliably see two cars ahead. This was actually a fairly useful feature. For instance, if there was a large car in front of me driving slow in the left lane, it would help me determine whether it was just that one car (so I could easily undertake) or multiple cars.
* Autopilot and cruise control can no longer be used in fog. This is the most egregious limitation. My commute to work is through the Blue Ridge mountains. Fog is frequent. There was one week where I didn't make it to work a single day without autopilot disengaging due to fog.

I always knew I’d eventually get back to driving a long range BEV EV sometime soon after parting ways with my Tesla Model S 75D about 3 years ago. I’ve been following the EV market ever since and when I knew the time had come to go back to a long range EV, I was *tremendously* excited. A lot has changed in the six years since I was in the market for an EV. At that time the Model 3 wasn’t even out yet and an inventory Model S 75D was the best option for me.

I’ve seen so many great looking EVs in my price range come to market since then and I was excited to dive into learning about all of them and going on lots of test drives.

post,y4agt8,,Auto high beams make Autopilot unusable at night,"The recent mandatory high beams with autopilot is basically the biggest step backward I’ve seen in my 6 years of owning teslas. The biggest issue is implementation and complete lack of predictability. 

It’s not possible to know at night if engaging Autopilot will cause the high beams to activate. Just last night I tried to activate Autopilot and the high beams came on making the car 3 lengths ahead of me think I was telling them to speed up so they brake checked me. 

Here are the issues. 

1. High beams turn on with every activation of autopilot.
2. There is no delay to give you the chance to turn them off. If the car thinks they should be on, the millisecond AP engages they come on.
3. The algorithm for the auto high beams is pathetically poor. They come on with cars in front of you, they come on with traffic coming the other way, they come on while traveling on well lit urban streets. 

All of this combines to make it so much of a hassle and annoyance to use Autopilot at night that it’s essentially not useable anymore. 

I get Tesla is covering their ass while they struggle to get the vision only AP system working but this is absolutely not the way to go about it. 

I would like to see at least one of the following. 

1. A timer that gives you 3 seconds to turn the high beams off after engaging AP

post,y4mawl,,Watch me struggle to turn the headlights back on on a pitch black road. Headlights need physical controls!,"A slightly frightening experience that I have dash cam footage of illustrates why these controls need to be close, immediately available, and physical.

Here’s the video: https://imgur.com/a/BiIy93H

Here are the facts: 
* I engage autopilot on a dark road. I don’t want the brights on and see an ephemeral menu with headlight options at a glance, so I hit “off,” assuming that these are controls for auto brights. It’s now pitch black and I can’t see where I’m going. This is my mistake, but drivers make mistakes and car interfaces should be forgiving.
* The intuitive action in this scenario is for me to reverse the physical action that I’ve taken and turn them back on the menu is gone now, and I’m in a scenario where I’m driving blind and trying to open a menu, scan the busy screen, and get the lights back on.
* I’m essentially forced to pull over and figure it out.
* You have a hint for what I fall back on and what requires the least thinking because I initially turn my blinker on, then the hazard lights, for some amount of light to see where I’m going. Both of these are physical controls.

Apologists will come up with 10,000 ways to blame me or say that “you should have/could have just done x,” but the point is that scenarios like this are unexpected and it should be intuitive to reverse them. I’m also not certain why the car allows headlights to be turned off at night, in drive, and at speed.

I’m a professional UX Designer and will clearly say that how Tesla has headlight control implemented has severe usability issues. I can get along with things like climate being behind menus, but not something as safety-critical as headlights.

They obviously can’t go around adding physical controls, but a band-aid could be something like only allowing headlight changes in park, or requiring confirmation of turning off the lights when it’s dark outside.

post,y67b12,,Inflation will remain elevated for a few more years,"**TLDR**: Companies will keep investing in redundant, diversified supply chains. Countries will force more localization due to national security risks. Energy prices will remain high. China will stick to its zero-covid policy. Rising rates will reduce demand and make credit more expensive. Reduced demand will hurt the economies of scale. Expensive credit will make ongoing investments more expensive to complete. Prices will keep going up for a few years, until these factors are mitigated. The market bottom will be when the companies cancel stock buybacks and start printing shares.

# Long read

The prevailing narrative today is that central banks will keep raising interest rates and sucking money out of the economy by other means, which will tame inflation sometime soon in 2023 due to reduced demand and economic slowdown. This is what the financial markets are pricing in, judging by bets on rates and bonds.

However, the global inflation we are experiencing today is not driven purely by monetary policies. That’s why inflation is global, spanning the whole world, even though different countries have vastly different monetary policies.

There are pockets of inflation, which are global, and were caused by relentless money printers, like real estate, travel, luxury goods, crypto, and various other assets. This is where the largest price reductions will continue. If you have any type of asset, it’s safe to say it will depreciate even more. Declines in housing and rent will drive down inflation metrics across the world, helping the central banks get closer to their inflation targets.

But the central banks cannot meet their 2% goals, because they cannot mitigate other factors causing global inflation. These are supply chain issues, caused first by COVID-19, then strict China zero-covid policies, then Russian invasion of Ukraine. We have an energy and food crises on top of that, also caused by the war in Ukraine.",13239,True,1666002005.0,2022-10-17 12:20:05,717,188,tebedam,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/y67b12/inflation_will_remain_elevated_for_a_few_more/,True,0.78,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,y78460,,Basic Autopilot problems getting worse and worse by the update. Stop-and-go traffic basically unusable.,"I’ve had my ’22 M3 RWD coming up on a year. It of course was always fully Vision Only with no radar. Over the past year, I had to wait for updates to get up to similar specs as the radar enabled cars: following distance, finally 85MPH, etc. Overall in the beginning, I didn’t have too many complaints with Autopilot. I didn’t have the phantom braking that many did. The only complaint I had early on was Autopilot drove too aggressively in stop-and-go traffic. Mainly it would fully accelerate up if the car in front just barely moved. It was so embarrassing I would never use it with guests in the car. I was able to work around that for the most part by lowering autopilot speed and changing to chill mode in those moments. Not ideal but it somewhat worked. I would do every software update in hopes it would fix it, like a lot of do. Fast forward to today. I down right refuse to use Autopilot in traffic because of how dangerous it is. It drives like a teenager learning to drive. It still does that full acceleration thing but now it slams on the brakes as soon as a car in front stops in stop-and-go traffic. And when I say the car in front stops, I don’t mean they slammed on their brakes, they were driving like a normal good driver would. I’ve had two different times where the brake check my cars does causes the person behind me to almost hit me. Needing to swerve off to the side. I’m too fearful to use it for the day when a driver behind me is just a tad distracted and bam, accident.  My old tricks of speed, following distance, chill mode, don’t seem to matter as much. 

Is anyone else dealing with this shit? I keep hearing they are gonna combine the FSD stack and life will be bliss but I’m not holding my breath. Stop-and-go traffic is the true time Autopilot should shine but I’d honestly say that I’ve driven in shittier competitors cars and they do a smoother job of it.

post,y7zjpn,,MS Cleaning inside glass in front of front facing camera,"
Recent posts about stop and go traffic and autopilot deterioration led to a few posts about hazing in front of the front cameras. In no way am I suggesting that cleaning the glass fixes stop-and-go issues, but if you have hazing (like I did), cleaning is moderately easy but does require patience and an awareness of when not to force a screw. I’ve linked a video below that describes this for a Model 3. It’s almost all the same for Model S (can’t speak to new MS, mine is 16/17) except the screws.  See the picture - 6 torx screws hold on the metal camera chassis. Crucial you don’t mess these up. (Edit: I’m second guessing which pair of screws in the top of the image to remove, but it’s obvious when you get in there).  Remove bottom 2 first. 

Instructions: There is a cover over the base of the rear view that comes off by hand. A pry tool is needed to get the next larger plastic housing off but be aware that there are (at least on a 16/17 MS) four small metal clips that are prone to coming loose. Be certain to watch for them, and if they come off just slide them back on. There is also a sort of lip that covers the mirror base to be careful of. With that removed the mirror can come down. The mirror is secured via a triangular sort of cam. Grab the mirror post firmly and twist from the base (no wrench needed as in video). It takes some effort but once it’s off you can remove the last plastic cover and metal chassis that holds the cameras. 6 T10 torx screws hold them on (pictured, double check the last pair). Do NOT force these to the point of rounding out the drive. Do NOT use too small a torx bit either. That’s a quick way to round them out as well. This metal chassis has to be firmly secured to the car or else the cameras will move around and render them mostly useless (I assume).  Carefully remove the 6 screws and the camera chassis will come loose (in the linked video for the M3 there appear to be only 2). No need to disconnect any wires.",2583,True,1666176962.0,2022-10-19 12:56:02,80,9,mshaefer,teslamotors,https://i.redd.it/r9xq8gpvtqu91.jpg,False,0.9,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,y8sdc4,,On Tesla's valuation (Part Trois),"Six and twelve months ago I made posts breaking down Tesla's hotly debated valuation ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8ka1h/on_teslas_valuation_part_deux/)) to determine whether it's really as expensive as people say, or as cheap as Tesla bulls claim.

After yesterday's earnings report, my analyses continue to seem fairly accurate, and I thought it would be worth updating the numbers to see if anything's changed.

For those who don't like reading, you can skip straight to ""The Numbers"". For everyone else, I will first explain again how I got to my numbers.

------------------------------

**The method**

While trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth into the future to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap might change slightly today, let's use their pre-earnings market cap of roughly $700B to determine if Tesla really is over- or undervalued.

For this post, I have also added the PEG rating, as this can give us a bit more insight into the valuation of a growth stock like Tesla.

------------------------------

**The trends**

In terms of revenue (TTM), Tesla had grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021 in my first analysis. After Q3 2022, that has grown to $74,863, with Q3 2022 being a 55% YoY increase.

In terms of operating margin, Tesla had grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021. After Q3 2022, that has grown to 17.2%.

In terms of GAAP net income (TTM), Tesla had grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,499M after Q3 2021. After Q3 2022, this has grown to $11,190M, with Q3 2022 being a 103% YoY increased.",9642,True,1666254030.0,2022-10-20 10:20:30,163,183,Ehralur,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y8sdc4/on_teslas_valuation_part_trois/,True,0.84,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,y95b0b,,"Test Drive Shootout: Rivian RS1, Tesla Y and 3, Ford MachE, Kia EV6, Audi Q4 E-tron"," 

I am a Tesla 2021 Dual Motor (with Accel Boost) LR Model Y, and Model 3 RWD SR owner. I also have a Tesla Roof and Powerwall on order.  I am also on the waitlist for a Rivian RS1, and was invited to a Rivian RS1 “First Mile” test drive. The next day, I drove a 2021 Mustang Mach E Premium and 2022 EV6 GT-Line AWD, both lightly used at a local Ford dealer. My buddy Rob, this same week, drove the Mustang Mach E, and Audi q4 E-Tron. Here is our summary:

TL;DR: All have very different personalities, and present credible alternatives to Tesla. The Tesla Supercharging Network and OTA Firmware and Software updates still present differentiating (and disappearing ) advantages that continue to position Tesla as a leader. However, the EV alternatives each have distinguishing characteristics that are done better than Tesla. My next purchases will likely be an RS1 for me, and the Kia EV6 for my wife. Rob has chosen the Audi E-Tron.

**EV6 Summary:**

Those in the know understand the killer product line coming out of Kia. With JD Power quality ratings just behind Lexus and Porsche and a design team built around ex BMW engineers, the Kia offering exudes, quality, composure and character that makes KIA the preferred choice of the Hyundai Group (Hyundai , Kia, Genesis) stable of EV offerings. Heads up display and 800V fast DC charging add to the most composed ride of the test group.

Pros:

800 V DC Fast Charging

Composed and comfortable cabin, chassis, ride; 

Hushed cabin with no road noise

Great front seats

CarPlay and Android Auto Integration

5 YR/50,000 Basic Warranty; 10 YR/100,000 Powertrain and Battery Warranty

Excellent fit and finish

Cons:

Limited rear hatch space; No Front Truck space

post,y9f39l,,Forced FSD disengagement for wearing sunglasses?,"This has happened twice to me so far, technically just while using auto pilot on the freeway. I'm paying attention to the road, and do not even have the chance to respond to the warning on screen and there are no blue flashes before the disengagement happens. It just happens suddenly.

At this point, I really do not use FSD at all, so I've turned it off as I do not want to lose future access to the technology for a silly issue with me wearing sunglasses for whatever reason.

I've never had a problem with forced autopilot disengagements (prior to FSD enabled) even while wearing sunglasses, but in the event that this does happen (with FSD now turned OFF) will that somehow still count as a strike against the use of FSD in the future?

Now to explain the situation.

I was getting on a highway from a on-ramp that had a yelid sign. There was a truck in front of me also waiting for a chance to murge onto the highway.

The truck started to proceed forward onto the highway and so I turned around to look if it was clear for me, it was... So I hit the accelerator and drove right into the truck ( that for some reason stopped ).

My question is why wasn't this prevented by my model 3. Autopilot or FSD was not on at the time, but there was no intervention or even a warning about a collision.

I'm a bit torned about this because I feel like the safety features that I always brag about to people let me down and I was wondering if this was just just an inconsistency with the safety features or am I missing something?

# Introduction

## Background

Intel used to be a giant in the microchip and semiconductor sector, but recently it found itself eclipsed by its competitor in matters of quality, strategic development and public perception. Those changes are due to its recent management team, which stagnated the company and slowed it with bad management decisions. With the new CEO Pat Gelsinger and his expertise, direct experience and know-how in the sector, the company is moving out from its slowdown and trying to catch up with its main rivals.

## Purpose

The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the development of Intel Corporation (INTC) during the past four years, from 2018 to 2021 and forecast its activity for the next five years. Not only are the financial statements taken into consideration but also macroeconomics factors and its main competitor Advanced Micro Device (AMD).

post,yflxve,,"The weekly ""Car Spotlight... Weekly"" Week 2: 1927-1931 Chevy AA/AB/etc.","u/Artien_Braum

Welcome back to the weekly “Car Spotlight… Weekly” thread!

A quick word before we get started on week 2 (ish). Because of the healthy engagement and the fact that we didn’t receive much feedback for the first article, I’m just going to make an (ass out of myself) assumption that everyone liked the format. So, we went ahead and just repeated what we did last time because I’m lazy AF (but really because I have a full time job and also consult for 3 other companies on the side and also am learning Spanish and HTML/CSS, but I digress). Anyway… shall we?

Rules (they haven’t changed):

1. This is a community driven thread. We will do our best to kick off the discussion, but need your help to fill it with juicy content.

2. Please, cite your references and give credit where it's due.

3. These are your fellow car enthusiasts. Even if you don't agree with their opinions, remember to always have their back and be respectful.

4. Be honest. We want to learn about the pros and the cons; the successes and the failures; the awesome and the infuriating. 

5. Enjoy the entertainment and learn something new.

Housekeeping (because my mom said I have to):

1. Please submit all requests for changes / improvements to the following [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/y3k3d4/the_weekly_car_spotlight_weekly_suggestions/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). This will help me stay organized. We also want to keep this weekly thread on-topic and not fill it with posts unrelated to the spotlit car.

2. Inflammable is STILL an annoying word. It has been 2 weeks and no one has done anything about it…

3. Be sure to read all the way to the end. I’ll have more information about the next spotlight down there.

post,yfou82,,Full self driving opt out,"Does anyone know if there is a way to remove full self driving beta?

It was fun for about a week, but there are some issues that make non-beta full self driving much more preferable.

Automatic windshield wipers forced on (this is really quite terrible as it functions quite poorly)
Automatic high beams (I really hate how it turns on every single time, within city limits and I’m worried about getting a ticket)
Automatic speed adjusting (this functions quite poorly now, barely slowing down as the speed changes, so I do it manually to avoid a ticket. Autopilot was a much more acceptable slow down)

And the most annoying thing, I’ve literally screamed at my car a few times now and quickly disabled anything FSD and switched to autopilot…

“Moving to fast lane” over and over again… you’re not supposed to be in the “fast lane” in Canada when there’s absolutely no traffic in front of you. The speed based lane changes happen even though it’s disabled. No way to stop it, it just keeps going into the wrong lane any chance it gets. I’ve looked up videos, read the manual, changed every setting and these problems persist. It completely bricks FSD beta for me.
And no, I didn’t pay for this. The company I work for gets us teslas as a benefit, I would never spend money on FSD, it absolutely not worth it.

The things I do like..
Stopping at red lights (same as FSD)
It accelerates quickly at green lights compared to regular FSD.
It doesn’t stop at every single flashing or green light like FSD does.

If anyone knows how to disable those functions, let me know.

post,yjhuve,,Dodge Shows Crate Hurricanes and Hellephants at SEMA,"[Dodge](https://www.autoweek.com/dodge) is unleashing a fleet of Hellephant crate engines at this year’s SEMA show. The Hellephant debuted at [SEMA](https://www.autoweek.com/sema-show/) in 2018 as a stand-alone, 426-CID crate engine that boasted 1000 hp. Now Dodge and Direct Connection will sell you a whole array of Hellephant models that range in power and displacement. Dodge is also peeling the curtain back on its Hurricane inline-six-cylinder engine platform, and its plans for next-generation crate engines.

Kicking off the Hellephant line of engines is the entry-level 376-CID, iron-block Hellephant C30, which advertises a cool 900 hp. Cranking it up a notch, Dodge will push that same 376-CID Hellephant to over 1000 hp with the Hellephant C170. The different names represent the percent of ethanol in the fuel (like proof you’d find on a bottle of liquor). If you want even *more* power, Dodge still offers 426 CID Hellephants under the A30 and A170 banners, with 1000 hp and 1100 hp advertised respectfully. All of these V8 mills sport a 3.0-liter supercharger on top and have upgraded internal parts compared to the production Hemi engine.

If that’s not good enough, Dodge and Direct Connection will also offer race-ready Hemi mills. Direct Connection will feature two race-ready Hemi engines in its catalog: the Drag Pak Hemi that makes an NHRA-certified 630 hp from 354 CID, and 1500 hp from the 426 CID Hemi.

post,ylcm2k,,One Year & 17k Miles Later with Model 3 LR,"I'm just about to hit a year with my Model 3 LR and just wanted to write a quick review for anyone considering purchasing one. 

I'm going to briefly touch on the most common questions I've heard and the experience I had with it. I'll keep it brief. 

First of all, I absolutely love the car, it's easily the most fun car I've ever owned, hands down. I constantly hear, ""It's built like a $20k car!"". Absolute non-sense! Have you driven a $20k car in 2022? I may be lucky but I've had zero issues with the car, other than a camera change, which was free and done at my home, while I was on vacation. Zero complaints!

Having everything on the center screen is great, I know many people complain about no buttons but there is a reason they aren't on our phones any more. Takes a bit to get use to, and by a bit I mean about 30min of driving. My brother drove it when he picked me up from the airport and said ""Very confusing, until you actually drive it, also how do you turn it off!"" Poor soul spent 30min googling trying to figure it out before he called me. 

Autopilot is great but I wouldn't spend a penny on FSD. I like to drive (zoom zoom) so I don't use it often but on long trips, what a god send. I remember a 4hr ride home, very hung over and thanking GOD for AP. It really does a great job staying in the lane and being comfortable. I've had maybe a few phantom breaks but almost all were when I first got it a year ago, total of maybe five light breaks for no reason but it's been nonexistant for a long time. 

Range is great, I absolutely needed the LR Model when I got the car but with a job change I no longer drive as much. I do feel like the range is a bit exaggerated, but not as much as people like to talk about. Currently I have about 97.5% battery capacity, so my max range is about 344 miles, which is still above the S+ and many other cars 100% range.",3642,True,1667504650.0,2022-11-03 20:44:10,224,122,MagnanimousCannabis,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ylcm2k/one_year_17k_miles_later_with_model_3_lr/,True,0.89,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,yoho5r,,"PSA: If your Tesla refuses to activate Autopilot with a ""Cruise Control Unavailable"" error, a door might be ""ajar"".","I just had to suffer through a few days of AP being broken in my 2018 LR RWD Model 3, before I finally decided it wouldn't fix itself and put in a service request. What was happening was that as soon as I tried to enable even just TACC, my car would throw up an error message saying ""Cruise Control Unavailable"" with a link to ""Read more"". The small steering wheel icon that indicates ""Autosteer is available"" would also never come up.

That link in the error message led into the car's built-in Owner's Manual (a pretty nice feature!), which is what gave me the obscure hint I needed to figure out the problem and cancel my service request.

The manual mentions that TACC may refuse to activate for various reasons, including if one of your doors is open. Of course, all of my doors were closed, and nothing was seemingly amiss, as every other system in my car worked fine, and I wasn't getting any other kind of warning about open doors. But on this hunch, I tried opening and closing all four doors and the trunk, and as soon as I got back onto the road, AP was finally available.

So I think what may have happened was that AP got into a state where *it* thought a door was open, but the rest of the car didn't. Probably some sort of minor bug in the AP stack (I don't have FSD beta).

post,yrzodf,,Elon Musk tells Twitter staff he sold Tesla stock to save the social network," 

Twitter's new owner Elon Musk, who is also CEO of electric vehicle maker [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) and U.S. defense contractor SpaceX, told employees of the social media business on Thursday that he recently sold shares of Tesla to ""save Twitter.""

He made the remarks during an all-hands meeting that he hosted in part to motivate Twitter employees who remain after sweeping layoffs to work hard. Musk let go of about half of Twitter employees following his acquisition of the company for $44 billion, or $54.20 per share.

[As CNBC previously reported,](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/) to finance his portion of that take-private deal, last week Musk sold at least another $3.95 billion worth of [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) stock. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission published Tuesday, the batch of shares he just sold amounted to 19.5 million more shares of Tesla.

Earlier this year, he also sold over $8 billion worth of Tesla stock in April and roughly $7 billion worth in August.

Musk has [brought in employees from Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html), including dozens of Autopilot engineers, to help with code review and other work at Twitter along with friends, financial backers and deputies from other companies that he has co-founded.

 

Among other things, [Musk wants Twitter to generate half of its revenue from Twitter Blue subscribers](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/read-elon-musks-first-email-to-all-twitter-employees.html), and to become less reliant on advertising revenue.

Musk’s Twitter distraction has shaken some of Tesla’s most stalwart bulls.

post,yuln4j,,I want peoples opinions on $TSLA,"*Short term noise*

$TSLA has fallen ~50% from ath mostly due to raising rates and all that shit but more recently the blue bird and Elon selling shares to feed the bird. 

The twitter purchase is annoying to me for 3 reasons. It takes away Elons time, its already cost a lot of $TSLA stock and he might end up selling more, and it’s causing uproar and extra downward pressure on the stock. But at the end of the day, it’s short term noise. Elon could sell all 420 million shares or whatever he owns and nothing would happen to Tesla the company longterm. 

Elon has been more erratic than usual lately, maybe it’s stress maybe he’s actually losing it. Maybe the power is going to his head, or it might just all be an act. Some of those are more likely than other of course, I’ll leave that there. Worst case Elon sells all his shares, tanking the stock and probably getting booted from the CEO spot. Idk if that’s actually how that works but regardless, Tesla would still be okay longterm. In my personal opinion, I think Elon is important to the company. I understand why some disagree, but that’s not what I’m debating here. 

*”DD”*

Tesla recently hit a PE of 56 with a forward PE of 35. Their last 3 quarters of earnings were $8.87b total, with a below average Q2 due to covid shutdowns in China. Q2 was only $2.26b in earnings, so if we assume tesla earns at least that (meaning negative growth Q/Q) 2022 will have earnings of $11.13b. 2021 and 2020 earnings were $5.52b and $721m. That will be another year of 100%+ earnings growth Y/Y. For reference the SP500 current and forward PE are ~19.5 and ~17, growth ~5-10%. 

So Tesla is growing and expected to grow earnings ~10x more than the SP500 but is only trading with a PE ~2x. This seems flawed to me. I have done screening and some comparison, but I’m sure some of you could say otherwise. 

Tesla is a car company, but it’s also much more. Not only are they leaders within the car industry they are outliers.",6324,True,1668390923.0,2022-11-14 02:55:23,0,86,carsonthecarsinogen,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yuln4j/i_want_peoples_opinions_on_tsla/,True,0.48,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

post,yw85ie,,2018 vs 2022 Model X long term family focused comparison,"I had a 2018 X for, well, about 4 years. I've put about 8k miles on the refresh and wanted to share thoughts for anyone thinking about upgrading.

Range - Huge win. I went from 270 to 340 miles, and faster charging. Add it all up and charging stops are about half as long as they used to be on road trips, since you can stay under 60 percent easier. Great!

Interior quality - Good improvement. Nicer materials. Everything is just a touch better. Still a small step down compared to my Genesis GV80, but it's fighting in the right league now.

Speed - Noticeably faster, even without plaid. Teslas are very fun to drive, and the refresh is better. 

Autopilot - Draw to slightly worse. I don't have the phantom braking issues I was expecting, and some parts work better, but there are a lot of small new bugs as well. Stop and go traffic, one of my biggest priorities, is worse as it slams on the brakes when someone 20 feet ahead slows down. I have to wonder if this is because they axed the radar. It ends up being slightly dangerous in city highway traffic jams. 

Controls - Disappointingly a little worse. No stalks, the yoke looks cool but isn't as functional, I'm tired of the button turn signals, I honk when turning on autopilot once a week, etc. These are just unforced errors, and while none are as bad as I feared, they are absolutely a small step back from a normal car.

Audio - Neutral. Was hoping for something a bit better, but no biggie.

Rear seat screen - It exists. Not really sure why it's there, or why there's a powerful GPU. Please give me more range instead. Kids don't really watch it because it's strangely positioned.

Suspension - A bit better. Again, not bad, but not as good as the GV80.

360 surround view - how is this still not a feature?

7 seat vs 6 seat - 3 wide second row is great if you have 3 kids. 3rd row is worse, but if you can use it a lot less, 7 seats is the way to go.

post,yzct79,,Tesla Model Y Postmortem (2 years of ownership),"After two years, I decided to ditch my MY 7 seater. Tesla has agreed to buy it back, and I’ve just finished signing the paper work. It’s been two years, and my heating/ac has never worked for longer than a spell of 2-4 weeks. I’ve had around eight service appointments, at different Tesla service stations to try to resolve it. On at least two of those visits, the climate control service warning came on within 24hrs of picking up the car. It’s bittersweet, as there are things about this car that I truly love, but, ultimately I’ve lost hope that they would ever be able to fix this issue. After two years, I thought it would be nice to put together a postmortem on my Tesla experience.

## The Good
* **Driving Dynamics** - My previous car was an ’08 Nissan Altima, so this was my first time having a sporty car. I really loved how fast it was. The steering wheel is great. It’s a little smaller than the average steering wheel, and combined with the tightness of the wheel, you really feel in control of the car. I hate driving cars that feel like they have a mushy steering wheel, one that you have to over turn to get the car to react. That is definitely not the case here. I’ve heard some complaints that it’s too tight, but I did not find that to be the case.
* **One Pedal Driving** - After using this, I cannot go back. I considered getting a hybrid after giving up on my Tesla, but I just don’t think I can go back to coasting, breaking, and having to putz around with the gas pedal. One pedal driving is an amazing experience, and Tesla nails it. 
* **Cargo Space** - This car had enough space, and seating that we didn’t need to cart our minivan on long road trips and vacations. The last road trip we did involved five people, a 40lb dog, the dog’s crate, and four pieces of luggage. Everything fit, and really with room to spare.  
* **20” induction tires** - These are beautiful. Probably the nicest looking thing on this car.",7375,True,1668867255.0,2022-11-19 15:14:15,843,517,LvstForLife,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/yzct79/tesla_model_y_postmortem_2_years_of_ownership/,True,0.89,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

&#x200B;

# The Good

* **Performance** \- It's zippy in a straight line until you get to extralegal speeds, and stays reasonably well composed in the corners when driving aggressively.
* **One pedal driving** \- Like the other guy, I REALLY liked this.  I will miss it and am not looking forward to having to use my brake pedal more.
* **Mobile app** \- Worked well for the most part (exceptions to be mentioned elsewhere).
* **Autopilot (Just Autosteer, TACC, and driver-initiated automatic lane changes. The rest to be discussed elsewhere)**\- This was the reason I bought the car and for the first couple of years, it steadily improved.   I still have no regrets buying the car + autopilot (basic autopilot wasn't included back then, it cost me an extra $5k).
* **Sound system** \- I'm no audiophile but pretty good to me.
* **Nav/charging integration** \- This made switching to an EV pretty simple, the car would generally figure out where I'd need to stop and charge, and it got better at it over time.
* **Overall reliability** \- Not the best I've had on a new car, but far from the worst.   Never left me stranded, never had a major feature stop working.
* **Frunk -** What a great, great place to keep things you need to have with you, but don't need to access every day.

Today marks one year of owning my Turbo X (and daily driving it)! Happy anniversary to my favorite car.

Saab - you don't get it until you do. And I can say that now I totally get it. There's a reason Saab drivers have a massive grin on their face when they're behind the wheel. I apologize in advance if this gets long, but I have a lot to say about this fantastically unique vehicle.

**First off, about the Turbo X, and what makes it different from any other 9-3.**

The Turbo X was only produced for the 2008 model year in celebration of 30 years of turbocharged Saabs. This was also the first Saab to feature the XWD system - Saab's proprietary 4-wheel drive system.

The Turbo X differed from a standard 9-3 with more power, stiffer suspension, carbon fiber effect trim, and larger brakes. It also features a different turbo gauge from the standard 9-3 which takes inspiration from the classic 900 Turbo. Only 2,081 production models were produced, of which 632 were imported to the States.

post,z2hsup,,2023 Ford E-Transit - My In-Depth Thoughts,"* **My Configuration - $55,770 base**:
   * **Cargo van, medium roof, long (116 mile EPA range)**: 
      * I wanted the extended length but it was only available in the high roof and I was afraid the range would be too affected - now I'm thinking I probably should have gotten it.

&#x200B;

* **My Options - $5,415**
   * **Load Area Protection Package $450**: 
      * The complete rear polypropylene panels on side walls and doors is just a medium duty corrugated plastic clipped onto the metal frame of the cargo area. The vinyl floor covering says it includes the wheel well liners but mine doesn't (just noticing it's supposed to have it so haven't asked the dealership about it). 
      * Verdict: 👎​
   * **253-Degree Opening Rear Door $70**: 
      * Comes with bumpers/magnets on the doors and side of the van which is a nice bonus. 
      * The door hinges have to be ""unlocked"" to open it the full way , and the dealership guy warned me to make sure the hinges line back up properly when closing the door after unlocking them or they could break, but they're on springs that makes sure they align when closing so I'm not sure if it's actually an issue.

post,z4tty2,,Model Y Performance ownership wrapup (2 years),"I recently traded in my MYP after two years and roughly 24,000 miles and wanted to share my ownership thoughts and some of the highlights and lowlights of the car.  This assessment is coming from a long-time car enthusiast and not an EV evangelist or EV hater.

I’ve done my best to leave out commentary on the community and the management of the company–while both of those factored into my personal decision to get rid of the car I wanted to focus on the merits of the car itself.

Tl;dr:  EVs do performance, packaging, and livability really well.  And they are going to be the future.  But my next EV is going to be from somebody other than Tesla.

***The good***:

* **Storage and interior space**:  
   * Between the massive under-trunk bin, the funk, and the flat rear passenger floor there is just an obscene amount of space for cargo.  I don’t think anything else can touch the MY for the sheer amount of discrete storage spaces.  Interior passenger space is also very open and roomy.
* **Acceleration**:  
   * Far quicker than any car its size has a right to be and the #1 reason I bought the car in the first place.  Power is accessible instantaneously and without drama–no launch control cheating, just stomp the long pedal and go. 
   * It’s the first car I’ve owned where I didn’t get used to/bored with the acceleration over time–it’s quick enough off the line that it just hits at a visceral level.  While acceleration falls off quickly over 60-70mph, there is more than enough for effortless passing at highway speeds.
* **One-pedal driving**:  
   * Love it.  In my daily commuting I would almost never touch the brake pedal.  The OPD is super dialed-in and very easy to modulate.  And it was downright fun to get the “perfect stop” where you rely only on regen and stop the car right on the mark.
* **Running costs**:  
   * While it liked burning through expensive tires, in two years the only consumables I had to buy were tires, windshield washer fluid, and cabin filters.",8565,True,1669424746.0,2022-11-26 02:05:46,622,170,AlrightAlbatross,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/z4tty2/model_y_performance_ownership_wrapup_2_years/,True,0.91,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Hi guys, I'm not even sure if this is the right place to ask but I figured there's no reason not to.

I own a small business fixing semi trucks. We were working with a regular customer who's having light problems with his semi truck. It has a similar fuse box to 9 other trucks he owns. We dived into a light problem on a new vehicle he has and found out it has a serious problem in the fuse box. Because of the lack of availability of the fuse box from suppliers (it's old, we didn't know anything really about it, and we didn't want to leave him hanging for his own business) we completely tore the whole thing down so we could understand how everything operates and made it work to keep his business moving. 

In total we spent about 18 hours testing everything, getting the vehicle functional through bypasses. Typically we charge 145$ an hour.  Approximately 6-8 hours weren't testing/diagnostics. 

I don't want to charge the customer 2500$ because we were learning a lot during the process.

post,zg7c4g,,The bottom is in. Just keep dcaing into indexes and in 20 years you'll have a lot more money.. Easy,"The bottom is always in when your outlook is 20 years from now my friends!

The best way to make money long term is to keep buying in small amounts each week into and index.

Ignore Cnbc! They're in business to keep people watching. Yes, you can learn some things and get a general market sense, etc,but take everything you hear with a grain of salt!

Remember that the people they have on are usually trying to pump their own stocks or get you to go along with their investing thesis,not to help YOU, but to make money for themselves. That's just my opinion.

Anyways I have about 20 good companies that I average down in but I'm slowly coming around to the idea of indexing a larger portion and just dcaing.

Some indexes I like are VTI QQQ QTEC IGV XLV IBB.

Then I have mostly blue chips like UNH MSFT AAPL GOOGL NVDA LIN UNP COST ASML LRCX etc.

But I think for the average investor with a 10 to 20 year look out, the ""bottom"" is NOW.

I mean by that that when you look back 5, 10 and 20 years from now most indexes and good companies will be a ""bottom"" compared to where they'll be in those.time frames.

So for the average investor seriously you're best bet to be successful long term is to pick an index or two, not a sector, but a broad index or two like say VTI and QQQ and just do a 50/50 weekly.

For example if you inest $100 A week, just put $50 into VTI  and QQQ each week and get on with life. You're not concerned with what happens next week, next month etc. You just keep buying!

So if you throw $50 into QQQ and it's  ""crashes"" 50% next week .... awesome!!! THATS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY!!

Always keep positive and have a positive outlook on life. Keep yourself fit and as healthy as possible and don't eat a lot of junk. Try to eat as little as you can. That's what I do now. I fast every day for at least 12 hours.

So keep buying into indexes. If you want to mess with individual  stocks I think you should keep it to about 20% of your portfolio  and maybe under 20 positions.",2424,True,1670524762.0,2022-12-08 19:39:22,0,27,apooroldinvestor,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zg7c4g/the_bottom_is_in_just_keep_dcaing_into_indexes/,True,0.43,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

My understanding is that even earnings contraction to a historically semi-normal level ($200 per share for SP500) at a 17x PE would only bring us slightly below the lows of this year.   Would be a drop from where we are, but not crippling.  Any form of recession would also possibly push the Fed closer to a pause, then pivot?  The “higher for longer” rhetoric from Jerome Powell seems to signal that they’re willing to allow a bit of pain, but at this point who believes the Fed?  What are the odds a “financial accident” occurs and really hits the economy?  Which brings me to my next point..

In a deeper recession, could we see a bit more PE contraction (say 15-16x) and SP500 EPS drop to $175?  What evidence is there for a deep recession vs. a mild recession?  Household debt levels, layoffs, past due mortgage rates, etc?  Which area seems like the last straw?

2.	Tesla makes great cars. Buyers remorse is almost non existent. People love their cars, flaws and all! There isn’t a car that is anywhere close to it from a technology perspective. (you may debate this - but find me a car that has a greater range + capabilities)

3.	Tesla does not spend a dime on advertising! Just think of the brand awareness and consideration this company has without spending a dime on advertising. Others are spending billions! Even Porsche who I think is the closest competition has billboards all over the place!

4.	They are profitable! This is not a smoke and mirror show. Maybe you say that the autopilot is a joke and not a fully featured solution. The retort would be, how many people are paying for FSD via subscription and what is the cancellation rate? It is near 5%. If Tesla is able to retain 95% of its customer base in something “frivolous” like FSD, surely there is something that FSD is doing correctly. 

5.	Tesla cars are priced where they are because of demand and supply. They are able to presell every car they produce. Obviously, the recession may cause some havoc and reduce demand in the short term. How will Tesla weather this? Based on the moves they are making, it feels like they are taking an active approach to managing staff, expenses and ultimately production. The drop in stock price is because of this! This is the uncertainty that is causing the institutional investors to reduce their positions. 

6.	Tesla has experienced meteoric growth and with the growth comes “fat” (ask any body builder).",4294,True,1671894355.0,2022-12-24 16:05:55,0,161,Infoaddict2012,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zublia/tsla_bull_case_qualitative_opinion/,True,0.47,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

Some quotes include a Powerwall, and others include Solaredge, which seems to be a direct competitor to the Powerwalls.

I know that a PW can talk to a Tesla charger and instruct it to limit the charge if it is being fed by the battery or solar, as opposed to the grid. (lowering the load from 48 to 15)

Can something similar be done with Solaredge? The battery can't provide 48 amps so if my Tesla charger can't be instructed to lower its load it would have to be left outside of the circuits fed by the battery and solar panels.",605,False,1671898844.0,2022-12-24 17:20:44,4,5,newbie_01,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/zud1jn/combining_solaredge_battery_with_tesla_charger/,True,0.7,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,zv03ht,,Is Tesla just an automaker?,"I see many bears argue that tsla stock is overpriced, comparing it to traditional automakers. However, unlike traditional automakers, tsla is also developing other technologies as well. To name a few, there's self-driving tech, solar panels. Beyond just producing cars, they also plan on the cybertruck and the semis. They are also taking control of their own supply chains (refining lithium, making batteries).

Taking all these into consideration, would tesla be considered a tech company, and would it reach a trillion dollar market cap again? Why or why not?


Personally I have 5k invested in tesla, have suffered around 50% loses, was thinking if I sound lower my cost basis, cut losses, or trade puts to hedge my position. I'm a new investor, and hope to receive some advice.

2. Turned off phone bluetooth so that the HUD has no connection, then tried to connect car to BT-TSLA,  it fails.
3. Updated the firmware to the latest, which at the time of writing is 3.17. Still fails. (the picture is before updating to 3.17, but same result regardless)

post,zz8vg9,,Tesla stock analysis and valuation - including DIY valuation,"Well, it took a bit, but finally here's my full analysis of Tesla.

***Disclaimer: I have a small position in Tesla with an average price of around $150/share.***

The post covers the following:

1. Introduction
2. Fundamental analysis of Tesla's automotive business, including cars sold, capacity, and future investments required.
3. Competitive landscape (profitability, debt & future growth/ROIC)
4. Historical financial performance
5. Assumptions & valuation
6. Valuation based on assumptions different than mine

&#x200B;

**Introduction**

I'd describe Tesla as a car company with big dreams and impressive technology. There are bulls and bears with different assumptions about the future, but if we look backward, there's no doubt that as a company, it disrupted the industry and accelerated the transition to EVs.

It operates in two segments, automotive (responsible for 96% of the revenue and almost all the gross profit) and energy generation and storage (attributing the remaining 4% of the revenue).

Now, I mentioned big dreams. That's of course, coming from Elon Musk. Let's take a look at a few of them:

1. FSD (Full self-driving capability) & robotaxis - Tesla was to some extent the first mover in this area and is likely the company with the most data. However, in my opinion, the competitors are catching up. As for the robotaxis, there's still some time until it becomes a reality and when it happens, Tesla won't be the only player on the market.
2. The ""energy generation and storage"" segment is to be worth as much as the automotive segment - Another big prediction that so far seems to have an incredibly low probability. Its current size is insignificant, it's not a profitable segment, and in order to become a significant portion of Tesla's value, well, it will take a long time.
3. Optimus - The humanoid robot is expected to be on sale by 2027 with a cost of $20k.",13025,True,1672427878.0,2022-12-30 20:17:58,96,91,k_ristovski,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zz8vg9/tesla_stock_analysis_and_valuation_including_diy/,True,0.82,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

post,10d1egl,,I Drove All The Way From Boston To Montreal Just To Check Out And Do A Thorough Tour On The Vinfast VF 8,"Full review on YouTube coming soon:

Since I heard that there is a Vinfast store in Montreal, I decided to drive all the way from Boston to Montreal QC just to check out the Vinfast VF 8 and VF 9. Obviously, Vinfast has seen a lot of controversy both on YouTube as well as Reddit with many accusing it of vapourware and many thinking that it is DOA (dead on arrival), but the Vinfast showroom has seen a lot of consumer interest not only amongst Vietnamese people, but I have also met one Laotian family, one Cambodian family, as well as many people from different races and ethnicites. Since the full tour and review on YouTube would talk about the specs, I am only going to examine the pros and cons of this car to see if Vinfast even has a chance in the US market given the fact that Tesla dropped the price of the Model Y to about 53k for the Long Range Edition.

**Positive aspects of Vinfast:**

* The Vinfast VF 8 Plus does have a lot of safety features such as traffic jam assist, auto parking, and smart summon (debatable if these safety features really work or they are just vapourware) as well as a big 15.6 inch infotainment system with a browser, voice recognition, navigation, as well as OTA updates. The fully equipped VF 8 plus even comes with a power liftgate (VF 8 Eco however has a manual liftgate), a panoramic sunroof, vegan leather, power seats, an electronic gear shifter/parking brake, as well as a frunk, just like the Tesla Model Y. It even has a heads up display and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, something which Tesla doesn't have on their cars, albeit CP/AA doesn't work on the Pre-production models.

The video, which remains archived on Tesla’s website, was released in October 2016 and promoted on Twitter by Chief Executive Elon Musk as evidence that “Tesla drives itself.”

To create the video, the Tesla used 3D mapping on a predetermined route from a house in Menlo Park, California, to Tesla’s then-headquarters in Palo Alto, he said.

Drivers intervened to take control in test runs, he said. When trying to show the Model X could park itself with no driver, a test car crashed into a fence in Tesla’s parking lot, he said.

“The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system,” Tesla's lawyer said, according to a transcript of his testimony seen by Reuters.

When Tesla released the video, Musk tweeted, “Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot.”

Tesla faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny over its driver assistance systems.

The U.S. Department of Justice began a criminal investigation into Tesla’s claims that its electric vehicles can drive themselves in 2021, after a number of crashes, some of them fatal, involving Autopilot, Reuters has reported.

post,10l9spv,,Tesla earnings are out — here are the numbers,"Electric vehicle maker Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings (adjusted): $1.19 vs $1.13 per share expected, per Refinitiv

Revenue: $24.32 billion vs $24.16 billion expected, per Refinitiv

In the year-ago quarter, Tesla reported revenue of $17.72 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.52 per share.

Earlier this month, Tesla reported vehicle delivery and production numbers for the fourth quarter of 2022 that set a new record for the company, but fell shy of the company’s goals and analysts’ expectations, despite having cut prices on its cars in December to spur customers to take deliveries before the year’s end.

Tesla reported 405,278 vehicle deliveries and production of 439,701 vehicles in the period ending December 31, 2022. Full year deliveries amounted to around 1.31 million, a record for Tesla, after the company started production at its new factories in Austin, Texas, and Brandenburg, Germany.

Last year, Musk said the factories were akin to “money-burning furnaces” in an interview with an owners’ club posted to YouTube in June.

So far in 2023, Tesla has continued to cut prices on its cars around the world, upsetting customers in the US and China who recently bought new Teslas at higher prices, and triggering an instant decline in used Tesla prices in the US as well.

Tesla solicits questions ahead of their earnings calls via a site called Say.com from both retail and institutional investors.

Among other things, investors on that site say they want to know what the recent price cuts will do to Tesla’s automotive gross margins, how much the company expects to grow sales of its cars in 2023, and when Tesla plans to start mass production and deliveries of its long-delayed, sci-fi inspired, pickup truck the Cybertruck.

post,10qvkx6,,P85D battery issues - warranty ending tomorrow! Car currently in TSLA service (for 3 weeks) - Please help!,"Hi,

My 2015 P85D (69,xxx mi) has a working battery but the range is very poor. I typically get only ~110 miles per drive from 90% charge to 20%. Recently it's been below 100 mi during a mild winter, and that's driving in Chill mode 100% of the time, which I don't want to have to do, having bought the Model S Performance variant.

We have reported this to Tesla many times over the past 3-4 years, during every service visit, but they keep saying the battery pack is fine. They also refuse to share the specific battery degradation stats so far despite many requests.

Each time they just say they diagnosed it remotely. Local service center previously doesn't really look into it in person, they just say it's fine every time based on remote diagnosis and try to dismiss the issue.

My energy consumption is normal (low 300s wHr/mi), driving in Chill mode.

It's very frustrating to report this for 3+ years, deal with it, and have no progress.  Supercharging time is now very slow as well:  1h 45 min from 20% to 90%. It makes the car feel like a burden rather than like a real functional car that makes transportation easier.

I also bought a new model 3, and it never had this issue - in fact it would consistently get more than the stated range (with similar driving style).

I suspect my battery pack is failing, or one or more of the battery modules aren't functioning correctly.
I know the battery has to fail for it to be covered under warranty - however in my findings it is failing, at least in part, but not showing a fault.

What can I do to get a battery back replacement, if they say it's showing no errors and they don't want to fix it?


Other observed strange behavior:

1. From 20%, charging back up to 90%, the car will say it added +60 kW or so each time.  But when I drive, the car will not use 60 kwh, it is always less, and always says it takes in more charge back from 20% to 90% than the car states I used during the trip meter.

post,10sk1gh,,On Tesla's valuation (Part 4),"In the past I've made multiple posts on Tesla's valuation ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8ka1h/on_teslas_valuation_part_deux/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y8sdc4/on_teslas_valuation_part_trois/)).

Previously I did them after Q1 and Q3, but because the last few months have been such a rollercoaster for $TSLA and it probably makes more sense to do them after the full year numbers anyways, I decided to do this one a little bit earlier. In the future I'll just be doing them after H1 and H2.

-----------------

**Looking back**

Since my first projections started with 2022, this is the first time we can compare my projections to Tesla's actual results. As such, I figured it'd be interesting to assess how far off my projections were.

Combining the bear and bull cases for 2022 of each post into a table together with the actuals:

**Sales**

||Part 1|Part 2|Part 3|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Bear**|1,400,000|1,400,000|1,350,000|
|**Bull**|1,700,000|1,900,000|1,500,000|

Actuals: **1,313,851**

In terms of unit sales, my projections were definitely too optimistic. Tesla ended up slightly underperforming my bear cases, although a caveat here is that Tesla had 60K cars in transit at the end of 2022 and missed out on ~75K units due to COVID shutdowns in China. Without these one-time occurrences, they would've ended the year on ~1,450,000 units above my bear cases but still significantly below my bull cases.

That said, accounting for force majeure is supposed to be part of the bear case, so I need to be more conservative here in the future.

**ASP**

For ASPs, I projected $50,000, $55,000 and $54,000 respectively. Actuals came in at **$54,385**, so I was pretty much spot-on.",7131,True,1675430093.0,2023-02-03 14:14:53,30,21,Ehralur,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10sk1gh/on_teslas_valuation_part_4/,True,0.75,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,113xc3n,,"Tesla recalls 362,758 vehicles, says full self-driving beta software may cause crashes","https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/16/tesla-recalls-362758-vehicles-says-full-self-driving-beta-software-may-cause-crashes.html

Tesla said Thursday it’s recalling “certain 2016-2023 Model S, Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving Beta (FSD Beta) software or pending installation.” The recall includes 362,758 vehicles.

The FSD Beta system may cause crashes by allowing the affected vehicles to: “act unsafe around intersections, such as traveling straight through an intersection while in a turn-only lane, entering a stop sign-controlled intersection without coming to a complete stop, or proceeding into an intersection during a steady yellow traffic signal without due caution,” according to the notice on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

The FSD Beta system may also have trouble responding appropriately “to changes in posted speed limits,” the notice said.

The group of affected vehicles included the following years and models: 2016-2023 Model S and Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with or pending installation of FSD Beta.

Tesla lets thousands of drivers try new and unfinished driver assistance features on public roads in the U.S. through FSD Beta. The technology does not make Tesla electric cars autonomous, nor safe to drive without a human at the wheel ready to brake or steer at any second — despite the brand name.

Only Tesla owners who have the company’s premium FSD driver assistance system installed in their cars can join the FSD Beta program. That option now costs $15,000 up front or $199 per month in the U.S. today. Owners must obtain a high driver-safety score, as determined by Tesla software that monitors their driving habits, and maintain it to get FSD Beta access.

FSD Beta can best be summarized as a host of new features that are not yet fully debugged.",2053,True,1676571941.0,2023-02-16 19:25:41,554,209,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/113xc3n/tesla_recalls_362758_vehicles_says_full/,True,0.84,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Yes, the battery, especially in the model Y has improved a little bit, and perhaps there are other changes coming in the next year. However nothing revolutionary appears to be around the corner, unless of course I'm mistaken.

Hyundai/Kia - the Ioniq 5 and EV6 will likely be quickly forgotten in 5 years time.

Ford - they seem to be making waves in the truck department, but nothing that would surpass a Tesla in a sedan or SUV form

GM - they're going for value for sure, but I'm not aware of anything in their pipeline that would be seen as revolutionary

VW/Audi - they're making EVs because they're forced to as a result of the dieselgate settlement. Definitely nothing earth shattering from them

Polestar - this is interesting, everything they build looks very nice from a design perspective but it feels very niche, nothing that will gain significant market share

Tesla on Sunday posted its first-quarter vehicle production and delivery report for 2023.

Here are the key numbers from the electric vehicle maker:

Total deliveries Q1 2023: 422,875

Total production Q1 2023: 440,808

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by Tesla and are not broken out by individual model or region.

The first quarter numbers represent a 36% increase in deliveries compared to the 310,048 reported during the same period a year earlier, and 4% growth in deliveries sequentially compared to the 405,278 they company reported in the last quarter of 2022.

The company reported deliveries of 10,695 of its higher-priced Model S and X vehicles, about 2% of deliveries in the quarter.

Tesla reported deliveries of 412,180 of its lower priced Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover during the quarter.

The company did not include production and delivery numbers for its heavy-duty Semi trucks. 

Tesla said it produced 19,437 Model S and X vehicles, and 421,371 of its Model 3 and Y vehicles for the period ending March 31, 2023.

“We continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds,” the company wrote in a statement Sunday.

Tesla now sells four models which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the US, one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin. In March, CEO Elon Musk announced the company plans to build a new factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from its factory in Austin, Texas.

The company also produces a heavy-duty truck, the Semi, at its battery plant in Sparks, Nevada. The company began deliveries of the Semi in December 2022.

According to a mean of estimates, compiled by FactSet as of Friday, Wall Street was expecting Tesla to report deliveries around 432,000 vehicles for the quarter. Estimates included in the FactSet analysis ranged from 410,000 to 451,000 deliveries expected.",2663,True,1680455896.0,2023-04-02 19:18:16,436,459,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/129rlfw/tesla_reports_422875_deliveries_for_first_quarter/,True,0.9,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

post,12ekzkx,,Tesla cuts U.S. prices for fifth time since January.,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/07/tesla-cuts-us-prices-for-fifth-time-since-january.html

Tesla cut prices in the United States between 2% and nearly 6%, its website showed on Thursday, as the company extends a discount drive on its electric vehicles that analysts caution could hurt profitability. The fifth such cut in Tesla’s largest market since the start of the year comes as the United States prepares to adopt tougher standards this month that are expected to limit EV tax credits. Tesla cut prices on both versions of its Model 3 sedan by $1,000 and on its Model Y crossover by $2,000, the website showed. It also cut prices on both versions of its more expensive Model S and Model X by $5,000. The company has said the tougher U.S. standards would reduce the $7,500 tax credit available for its base, rear-wheel drive Model 3 since January.

Some analysts who expected the further price cuts had flagged concern that Tesla’s industry-leading profit margins could be at risk. This week Tesla reported first-quarter deliveries of almost 423,000 vehicles, up just 4% from the prior quarter after price cuts in the United States, China and other markets aiming to spur demand. Tesla has set a target of 1.8 million deliveries this year.

post,12kkdkr,,Why Tesla is losing its EV dominance ?," 

Tesla ($TSLA) should be looking over its shoulder at the fully charged EVs barreling right toward its castle.

While Elon Musk's non-Twitter creation still has a stronghold on the EV market based on name recognition, market share, and production capabilities, the clear takeaway from this year’s New York International Auto Show (which Tesla was not a part of) is that traditional automakers such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Nissan (NSANY) are all gunning for Tesla's dominance and lucrative profit margins. 

## Hyundai aims to lead the EV pack

“Tesla who,” Hyundai Motor Americas CEO Randy Parker quipped when Yahoo Finance Live asked about Hyundai's IONIQ 6, an EV that was named 'Car of the Year' for 2023.

The impressive specs and pricing of Hyundai's IONIQ 6 places it in direct competition with Tesla's Model 3, the second-most-popular EV in the U.S. Hyundai's IONIQ 6 starts at $41,600 with a range of up to 240 miles. By comparison, the $41,990 Model 3 reaches 272 miles on one charge.

Gap closed.

“The IONIQ 6 from a technology standpoint, you can’t do better,” Parker crowed.

And it’s that type of Tesla mentality that’s likely to test the EV leadership of Musk's EV outfit.

Older automakers known for their gas-powered rides are ramping up their push into the EV market with edgy new styles and attractive specs like those showcased at this year's New York Auto Show, including the Kia EV9, Nissan Ariya, Chevrolet Equinox EV, and Ram 1500 REV electric truck.

These will be added to a class of solid EVs already in the market like Ford's F-150 Lightning and Mach-E and the coming Chevy Silverado.

## What's next for Tesla

Tesla's Cybertruck isn't even on the market yet. The company is reportedly working on a compact EV dubbed the Model 2, but it's unclear when that will arrive. 

S&P Global estimates the EV market will grow from just over 50 models today to 78 by year-end before more than doubling to 160 by the end of 2025.",4278,True,1681382178.0,2023-04-13 12:36:18,0,126,ProcedureFun410,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12kkdkr/why_tesla_is_losing_its_ev_dominance/,True,0.37,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

post,12qztiy,,Tesla Club Sweden visits Giga Berlin,"Original article in Swedish, by Tibor Blomhäll, founder of Tesla Club Sweden.
https://teslaclubsweden.se/rundtur-i-berlinfabriken/

tl;dr – We got to visit Giga Berlin and it was awesome!

[Together with Tesla Club Sweden I went to Giga Berlin last Friday. Tibor wrote a good article, which I am providing a translation of, and adding some of my own comments to, like this. @bjelkeman]

Tesla invited us at Tesla Club Sweden to a tour of their car factory outside Berlin last Friday. Today's article is about the factory, tomorrow we will tell you more about what else we did in Berlin. [We were told that the Tesla clubs where used as beta testers for the tour and we were the second club to get a tour.]

The factory is perhaps best known as Giga Berlin, although its official name is actually Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg to indicate that it is technically located 4 km outside Berlin's city limits.

Immediately upon arriving at the factory, you realize that Giga Berlin is as much a construction site as a car factory. The huge factory building is already being expanded and has also been joined by separate buildings where electric motors and battery packs are manufactured. [The huge car park is partially completed. You walk across somewhat of a building site to get to the security hut. The nice entrance to the factory isn’t finished yet. It is clear that they are prioritizing the building of cars!]

Unfortunately we were not allowed to take any pictures inside the factory, the pictures you see here are from Giga Berlin's opening party two years ago.

post,12s8m77,,Tesla net income and earnings drop more than 20% from last year,"Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv

Revenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates

Net income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.

Automotive revenue, Tesla’s core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.

Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.

The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.

Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.

Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.


Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management’s consideration were seeking updates on the company’s trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company’s energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.

In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.

A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas.",2607,True,1681935275.0,2023-04-19 22:14:35,3463,871,Kashyapm94,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12s8m77/tesla_net_income_and_earnings_drop_more_than_20/,True,0.94,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

post,13l5gc0,,[D] The Question facing Nvidia,"The problem this stock faces is no one knows how to value it.

The company are investing in technology that opens up new markets (AI, Omniverse and self driving for example).  Will those markets pan out or will they go bust?  And if they do pan out, what's the value of those markets?    Nobody knows, these markets haven't been served before.

Today's share price is a reflection of the market sentiment, the voting machine's results as of this moment.   The current share price is either grossly over extended or grossly undervalued -- there is no in between in my opinion.

I believe Nvidia has cemented itself as the hardware technology leadership company of the era, much like IBM and Intel of past decades.   Some on Wall St understand this, others are coming to understand it.  But there are many who doubt that is the case as well.

The most obvious question from doubters is about competition:  Won't AMD or Intel or Google or Apple just come in with better technology and take their position?

I've been invested in this company for more than 15 years and what they do uniquely are two things:  1.  Strategize and 2.  Execute.   They have been building a GPGPU platform (General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit), otherwise known as ""accelerated computing"" since about 2007.   It's different from standard CPUs in that it processes massive amounts of data in parallel, tens of thousands of ""cores"" operating at the same time.  Their platform is a combination of inter-generational compatible hardware and software.  The platform is robust, reliable, well supported, offers regular performance improvements, and is now ubiquitous with over 4million developers using it including nearly every AI developer on the planet.

So when a competitor comes to throw their hat in the ring, there is an enormous defensive position to overcome that includes a large user base who are getting reliable, quantifiable and predictable results.",4107,True,1684431597.0,2023-05-18 19:39:57,92,54,norcalnatv,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/13l5gc0/d_the_question_facing_nvidia/,True,0.85,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,13nxvrt,,Covering Frame Rust - Tips to keep it from getting worse,"I recently bought a used vehicle from Canada that apparently was washed only from the “top down”, so the body and paint looks great, but the frame and subframe does have some good rust beyond just surface rust. 

It’s a 2020 model year so it’s not too advanced yet, but looking ahead several years down the road, I don’t want to let it get worse and become a structural issue. 

What I would like to do is thoroughly clean the underside to get rid of any leftover salt brine left in any crevices, and then coat it with some sort of rust reformer or preventative to keep it from getting worse.

My question is looking for tips on what coating would work best to keep the rust from advancing further. 

I’m aware typical rubberized undercoating is the worst thing to apply, as it essentially traps moisture against the metal and causes rust to  accelerate. I’ve heard of fluid film wool wax, which is supposed to provide a moisture displacing coating that will stop of chemical process of iron converting to rust, but I’m curious if anyone has any real-world results to back their claims up. 


It’s worth mentioning the vehicle is now in the southern US and will seldomly if ever be exposed to salt again in the future. Please no suggestions for “pull the body and sandblast the entire frame back to metal”, as I don’t have the time to money for that.

Tesla ($TSLA) shares jumped 3.6% today, extending the company’s record winning streak to 13 sessions in a row. In that time, shares have risen nearly 42%, adding further gains to an already big year for Tesla shareholders.

  
Tesla stock is rising in tandem with the overall market today on cooling inflation data, but the shares have been on the rise for a couple weeks now. The latest big news came late last week when General Motors (GM) announced it was joining forces with Tesla to leverage the electric vehicle maker's Supercharger Network. The companies announced the Tesla Supercharger Network will be open to GM EV drivers starting next year, and by 2025 GM anticipates its EVs will include Tesla’s NACs connector, which will allow for direct access to Tesla Superchargers.

GM’s move comes two weeks after Ford (F) announced a similar partnership with Tesla to enable access for Ford vehicles to Tesla's charging network.  
Several industry analysts recently told Yahoo Finance that Tesla's partnership with Ford would be a positive tailwind for Tesla's revenue moving forward.  
""Recall in our 2022 report that we sized the potential for Tesla opening its network more widely in the next few years (i.e. more than just Ford) at $1-$3 bn of incremental revenue (although Tesla wouldn’t necessarily capture all of this),"" Goldman analyst Mark Delaney wrote in a note following the Ford deal. ""We believe the news is a modest incremental positive for Tesla as it will likely bring in additional profits and help Tesla to sustain the most robust charging network, albeit with some risk of fewer vehicle sales.""Nonetheless it hasn’t all been good news for Tesla during the recent run-up, as the stock brushed aside negative reports about the upcoming and highly anticipated Cybertruck.",2800,True,1686736088.0,2023-06-14 11:48:08,550,283,Ben_aid,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1493mza/tesla_stock_extends_record_streak_to_13_sessions/,True,0.88,2023,both,search,False,False,0,
post,149ifrq,,"Chinese EV giant BYD overtakes Tesla, but can it crack the U.S. market? (Washington Post)","By Meaghan Tobin, Lyric Li

Thai YouTube star Jo Chirawatt recently took two of the best-selling electric cars in Thailand for a test drive. One was Tesla’s Model 3. The other was the Atto 3, made by Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD.

The Atto 3 marked “the iPhone moment” for EVs, Chirawatt told his nearly 900,000 YouTube followers, suggesting it would set off a hype cycle that would transform a novelty purchase into a mainstream luxury. For most of the world, previous generations of EVs were aspirational purchases.

From Bangkok to Tel Aviv, BYD — which stands for “Build Your Dreams” — has been pushing to make EVs mass-market.

The Chinese car company, which has also sold low-priced gasoline-powered cars for more than a decade, has this year surpassed Tesla to become the top-selling EV brand in the world.

At the Shanghai auto show in April, the company’s biggest bid yet to capture the global market for affordable EVs was unveiled in the tiniest package, with the lowest price tag: a compact battery-powered hatchback called the Seagull that sells for just over $11,000.

“The Seagull was the shot heard around the world when it comes to affordability of electric vehicles,” said Bill Russo, founder and chief executive of the Shanghai-based advisory firm Automobility.

This year has marked a moment of arrival not just for BYD but for the much-maligned Chinese auto sector as a whole.

The country exported 1.07 million cars in the first quarter of this year, according to China’s Association of Automobile Manufacturers — overtaking Japan to become the world’s top auto exporter.

One out of every four of those cars was electric. BYD models are now the top-selling electric vehicles in Thailand, Israel, New Zealand and Singapore.

Like many Chinese tech companies before it, BYD has targeted fast-growing emerging markets without strong local brands. It did the same with its earlier gas-powered cars, selling across South America, Africa and the Middle East.",6813,True,1686775016.0,2023-06-14 22:36:56,2,12,bitemy,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/149ifrq/chinese_ev_giant_byd_overtakes_tesla_but_can_it/,True,0.57,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

post,14aicet,,who knows about the tesla battery and motor compatibility of the original tesla roadster and a model 3?,"this probably isnt the subreddit to ask but the 2 subreddits dedicated to this car are both under 50 people, are basically vacant, and only approved people can post, so ill have to do it here hoping someone knowledgeable can advise me on this

so I found this surprisingly affordable 2008 tesla roadster and I started thinking about the possibility of doing a motor and possibly a battery swap with a more modern tesla.

&#x200B;

The battery portion would obviously be a lot of work, but with how modular tesla batteries are, it might be possible to take it all apart to its bare cells, and basically reconstruct the battery with a new battery housing following the basic structure of the original casing, only made to fit the shape of the one found int he roadster. that of course would be quite difficult, but my question is would it be doable. and probably the easier side of the equation, a model s or model 3 motor swap. i would have to get one that didn't have 2 speed transmission to ""simplify"" things, but would it be possible and would i or would i not be incredibly frowned upon for doing that to a roadster. and the last thing and the easiest of all, since i would be replacing the battery and the motor, might as well upgrade the charge port to NACS as well.

So, if there are any knowledgeable tesla roadster owners out there in this thread or at least someone who knows a good deal about the tesla roadster, how possible would this be. its a very analog car, so i imagine there wouldnt be too much software interference, but of course, adding a new drivetrain and battery might not take too kindly to the old computers in the car. and im assuming the likelihood of this being possible is near zero since many tesla roadsters were actually taken apart in order to use them for parts to fix existing tesla roadsters, but doesnt hurt to ask.",1853,False,1686875586.0,2023-06-16 02:33:06,1,8,AvailableProgram667,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/14aicet/who_knows_about_the_tesla_battery_and_motor/,True,0.67,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Meanwhile, Tesla is ramping up end-of-quarter vehicle delivery incentives.

Tesla stock recorded two tiny losses and ended a record 13-day win streak last week. However, on Friday shares rose to a fresh eight-month high. Ahead of Tuesday's trade, TSLA was up more than 70% over the past seven weeks, but still short — down around 17% — of September highs.  
  
Cathie Wood has been buying up Tesla on the cheap throughout 2023 before selling big in recent days.

On June 12, Wood sold off more than 393,000 shares of Tesla for around $98.2 million, based on TSLA's closing price of 249.83. Cathie Wood's funds purchased more than 1.3 million TSLA shares so far in 2023 and have now sold around 730,000 shares.

Tesla stock jumped 5.3% to 274.31 Tuesday during market trade.

# Final Push For Vehicle Deliveries

Tesla increased discounts on U.S. inventory Model S and Model X vehicles by $2,500 late Friday. Consumers can now get $7,500 off the luxury models after the EV company originally implemented a $5,000 price cut a few weeks ago.  
  
Meanwhile, days after Tesla increased U.S. Model Y all-wheel drive prices by $250, the company now offers discounts of around $500 on some inventory vehicles.  
  
Tesla also appears to be trying to move Model 3 inventory. Last week, the automaker began offering customers who order a Model 3 between June 14 and June 30 three months of unlimited free supercharging, according to the company's website.

post,14uirtn,,Potentially controversial car opinions thread,"I have a few controversial thoughts about cars and the current landscape of the car market that I want to share. Some of these are more controversial than others. Feel free to respond or share your own thoughts too.

&#x200B;

1. LUCID never intended to be a successful car company, but rather they intended to be an engineering firm and their cars are just being used to showcase their technology and gain publicity.   
The Air came out as a large luxury sedan. That is the most overcrowded EV segment, but it shows that LUCID is prioritizing its engineering over all else. Ever decision about the car was made from an engineering standpoint. The body is an ugly sedan, because that's the most aerodynamic shape. Its a luxury car to help hide the expensive costs of the battery and other electric drive train components. All of the drive-train components are some of, if not the best components in any electric vehicle. There are videos on youtube that LUCID posts that go into extensive details of why they are so efficient. LUCID has one single video on design posted. Its under a minute long and basically says that it was designed by the engineering team for efficiency.  
We're already seeing them begin to do engineering work for other companies like Aston Martin and this trend will only continue to grow.
2. Several traditional car companies are pricing themselves out of relevancy and leaving a huge gap in the market for startups and Chinese car companies to come in and take over. People can't buy exactly what they want. They have to select from the choices that they're given. As most car companies have raised their prices significantly in the last couple of years, consumers generally still have to pick from any of the now expensive cars. There is now a huge hole in the lower end of the new car marketplace for someone to come in and make a killing with a half-decent offering.",5035,True,1688858848.0,2023-07-09 01:27:28,757,1290,Jimmaayy,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/14uirtn/potentially_controversial_car_opinions_thread/,True,0.87,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

Cybertrucks are going to be ramped up super fast and are expected to sell 60,000 units this year and more than 100,000 next year. Thanks to the single shot casting method which all these legacy autos like Ford, GM , BMW can not even think about, let alone designing it 

Cybertrucks will revolutionize and disrupt trucks and will probably eat F150s lunch just like how Model 3 and Y revolutionized Sedans and SUVs. They already has a record smashing quarter, setting a record for highest deliveries ever.  Tesla earnings Wednesday after hrs. Implied move about -/+ 7%.

post,15b4qg7,,Source: Tesla rigged the dashboard to overstate battery range; created a “Diversion Team” to suppress thousands of complaints,"In March, Alexandre Ponsin set out on a family road trip from Colorado to California in his newly purchased Tesla, a used 2021 Model 3. He expected to get something close to the electric sport sedan’s advertised driving range: 353 miles on a fully charged battery.

He soon realized he was sometimes getting less than half that much range, particularly in cold weather – such severe underperformance that he was convinced the car had a serious defect.

“We’re looking at the range, and you literally see the number decrease in front of your eyes,” he said of his dashboard range meter.

Ponsin contacted Tesla and booked a service appointment in California. He later received two text messages, telling him that “remote diagnostics” had determined his battery was fine, and then: “We would like to cancel your visit.”

What Ponsin didn’t know was that Tesla employees had been instructed to thwart any customers complaining about poor driving range from bringing their vehicles in for service. Last summer, the company quietly created a “Diversion Team” in Las Vegas to cancel as many range-related appointments as possible.

The Austin, Texas-based electric carmaker deployed the team because its service centers were inundated with appointments from owners who had expected better performance based on the company’s advertised estimates and the projections displayed by the in-dash range meters of the cars themselves, according to several people familiar with the matter.

post,15fr5me,,Is Tesla really here to stay?,"(Not intended as a bait post, but a serious question)

A little over 10 years has passed since the [first deliveries of the Model S](https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-motors-begin-customer-deliveries-model-s-june-22nd), and without getting into the politics/psychology of the CEO or the enthusiast relevance of their cars, the company itself seems like it's entering a period of stability (uh, relatively speaking). They continue to deliver cars in volume, and [it looks like that volume is increasing.](https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/tesla-us-sales-figures/#:~:text=TESLA%20ANNUAL%20SALES%20AND%20MARKET%20SHARE) According to their [latest quarterly report,](https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/TSLA-Q2-2023-Update.pdf) their other business ventures are at least not a major source of drag on their financials, and unlike earlier years, [starting in 2021](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594778/tesla-q2-2021-earnings-revenue-profit-credits-emissions-bitcoin) Tesla isn't (at least part of the time) relying on resale of energy credits to be profitable. In short, they're making more cars and the company is probably actually profitable.

They have introduced desirable new products since 2017 (Model 3 and Model Y), and continue to be seen -- at least by investors and competitors -- as a market leader in North America in the EV space. And while they face [increasing competition abroad](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-electric-vehicle-market-share/) from Chinese brands and traditional automakers, they remain a powerful force outside North America too, which certainly seems to indicate that Tesla's products are desirable as well.

**Sales**

Last time I lowered my bear case for 2023 to 1.7M, with 2.15M sales expected and 2.4M in the bull case. With 889K cars sold in H1 and the announced retooling for the Model 3 refresh, I expect them to comfortably exceed my bear case, but believe the bull case needs to lowered to 2.2M for an expected amount of sales of 1.95M for the full year. With the slightly slower ramp in Texas and Berlin, the slower than expected rollout of the Cybertruck and Mexico only coming online by the end of 2024 at the earliest, I will also lower the bull cases for 2024 and 2025 from 3.4M and 4.8M respectively:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|1,800,000|2,200,000|
|**2024**|2,400,000|3,000,000|
|**2025**|3,000,000|4,400,000|

**ASP**

I expected Tesla to decrease ASPs from $54,385 to ~$51K in 2023. With ASPs of $46,379 in H1, and although I expect ASPs to be higher in H2, I will also lower my expectations here to $47K.

I then expect ASPs to increase to $49K in 2024 and then start to decline with the introduction of the compact car, starting with $48K in 2025.",4023,True,1691147399.0,2023-08-04 13:09:59,17,15,Ehralur,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15hx56g/on_teslas_valuation_part_5/,True,0.7,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,15kvith,,The Real Issue With EVs Is That They're Just Not Big Enough For Americans,"Following up from my post here yesterday, I found [more information](https://jalopnik.com/the-real-issue-with-evs-is-that-theyre-just-not-big-eno-1850669545) supporting that one of the main reasons EV adoption isn't happening faster is because they're too small. I continue to firmly believe that you can't ask consumers to give up functionality of their existing vehicles — namely SUVs and trucks — to go electric. I understand that there are feeling about how we got into this situation to begin with and that a lot of people in this sub believe that vehicles are too large and should be made smaller. I agree with that in part, but we also need to be realistic about our present environment and acknowledge where consumers are at today.

I know that many people believe the government should step in and limit vehicle size, but I don't believe that's a winning strategy to drive EV adoption. I personally think that consumers need more choice and that means bigger vehicles. Here are some key points from the article above:

>“For a lot of people, that third row is the No. 1 reason for purchase,” says Jess Bala, director of global product planning at General Motors’ Cadillac brand, which is scheduled to reveal an electric Escalade IQ large SUV in August. “Those are often younger buyers who already are more interested in EVs.”  
>  
>Of course, it stands to reason that EVs expanding into new categories have an opportunity to reach new demographics that they haven’t been able to yet, like women and families. We’re still in the early adopter era, after all. That said, it’s not like there aren’t a wealth of midsize-plus electric SUVs out there.

post,15n1sl5,,My EQS sedan long term review,"So I leased an EQS 450+ sedan 4 months ago and wanted to give my thoughts in a brief long term use review. I'll break it down by category. 

Styling: Probably the biggest criticism you see about the EQS. Obviously this is subjective.  Personally I like it. I think it looks odd in pictures, but due to its size and stateliness looks better in person. It has a heft, stance, and weight that most sedans and other cars lack in an era where everything is a CUV. It is also fitting of an S class equivalent. That said, there's no denying it doesn't have the sex appeal or head turning nature of a Taycan, E-tron GT, or other 100k plus cars. 

Interior: I LOVE this cars interior. Great materials, good design, extremely comfortable seats. It has all the goodies like the massaging seats and what not. The UI is great and responsive. Voice controls work well. Built in navigation is excellent. I don't think I can ever buy a car without a HUD now. It is that awesome. This really separates this car from a Tesla, which feels cheap by comparison. On the downsides: wireless CarPlay is sometimes finicky or doesn't connect. The wireless charging spot is also finicky and sometimes doesn't charge. 

Handling and Ride quality: Another huge plus: It handles amazingly at low speed due to the rear wheel steering. You have to try it to believe it. It's a beast of a car but whips around low speed turns around the city like my old mazda2. At highway speeds it is super stable and comfortable. The air suspension is amazing. It is the quietest car at highway speeds I've ever seen. No road or wind noise. FWIW I've driven an EQE 350 SUV as well which has much more wind noise and body roll, unsurprisingly given the shape. On windy roads it is super planted and confident with no body roll, very poised. Of course it is an S class. It doesn't feel like a sports car and you don't feel the road like a model 3, but also much more comfortable. 

Performance: Another knock on this car is it's slow for the price.",4158,True,1691641130.0,2023-08-10 06:18:50,163,101,toado3,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/15n1sl5/my_eqs_sedan_long_term_review/,True,0.96,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,15otjua,,Why not build more low-tech EVs?,"Manufacturers of electric cars always seem to be catering to futuristic rich techy crowd whenever a new one is announced, and it always makes me wonder why. If anyone were to design and sell an EV without all the bells and whistles of a Tesla or a Rivian, I would buy one immediately. 

I drive a 2008 Scion xB and I feel right at home and I only wish it could run on electricity. Great range, spacious interior, decent sound, fun to drive but not for showing off, and it all works great. All the other stuff I can live without, and I feel so many would think the same. 

It feels like smarter call for business to invest in lower end models like this too. You'd get a lot more average customers who can afford a lower price and will buy more of them than the smaller number of more well-off folk buying them.

post,15qreqy,,My 2 weeks ownership review of the BMW i4 eDrive35,"In my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/15f69xd/after_a_bunch_of_shopping_around_i_just_leased_a/) I discussed the decision making process that led to me leasing a BMW i4 eDrive35 as the replacement for my Model 3 Performance being my daily driver. So now I've officially owned the car for 2 weeks, here is what I think of it so far.

*Disclaimer*: This entire ""review"" is mostly based on my *personal* preferences and I evaluate the pros/cons based how it fits my current needs. Different people like different things so your milage may vary (pun intended).

**Exterior**: It's not the prettiest car on the road, but I do like how it looks for the side and the rear and even the front has grown on me a bit to no longer be offensive. I thought the [silver color](https://imgur.com/a/DIJIu2c) was boring at first but I now really like it since it looks quite sleek and my Porsche is already [flashy enough](https://i.imgur.com/NUIh557.jpg).

**Powertrain - Performance**: First of all, this car is *a lot* slower than my Model 3. Now with that out of the way, just how slow is the slowest EV BMW sells at the moment? The answer is it's actually quite decent. BMW's official numbers are 282hp/295lb-ft/5.8s 0-60. In typical BMW fashion I suspect all those numbers are generously underrated and the car feels properly fast at speed up to 50mph. Launching at 0mph actually doesn't feel as fast as stomping the throttle at 30mph (which is fast enough to scare unsuspected passengers). My guess is it's related to RWD/traction control.

post,15v0evh,,Friendly reminder that a person’s EV road trip experience can vary wildly depending on the region they live.,"I see some variation of this conversation over and over online. One person will say something like “EVs are inconvenient to me. I have to stop longer and more often than usual. It turned my typical 7 hour road trip into a 9 hour trip!” And another person will respond with something like “I just did a 7 hour road trip and the EV didn’t add ANY time. By the time I use the restroom and grab something to eat, the car is ready to go!” But here’s the rub, they BOTH can be right, even if they’re talking about the same car. The impact that an EV has on your road trip experience can vary wildly depending on where you’re travelling. Let’s take a look at two scenarios.

&#x200B;

Person A is taking a round trip in a Model Y LR from his home in the Norfolk, VA area up to the New York, NY area. Because of the traffic and speed limits, the 360 mile trip takes 6.5 hours both ways. The place he’ll be staying has a Level 2 charger where he can charge overnight. According to ABRP, he can do the entire trip with just one \~30 minute stop on the way there and one \~30 minute stop on the way back. He normally makes a 30 minute stop to eat lunch when using his gas car anyway, so the Model Y doesn’t add any time to his trip. His typical 14 hour round trip still takes 14 hours. 

&#x200B;

Person B is also taking a round trip in a Model Y LR from his home in the San Antonio, TX area out to El Paso, TX area. Since he can comfortably drive 85 mph for the entire 550 mile trip, it usually takes him around 7 hours each way including stops, meaning his typical round trip is also 14 hours. (Note: This is another area that causes confusion with people in different regions. The speed limit during most of the drive is 80 mph with a few areas at 75 mph. 85 mph is the actual flow of traffic and not some dangerously high speed that you may be picturing if you’re used to 65 mph highways.) The place he’ll be staying does not have EV charging, so he’ll be relying on Superchargers for all his juice.",4868,True,1692402669.0,2023-08-19 01:51:09,106,60,JohnDeaux2k,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/15v0evh/friendly_reminder_that_a_persons_ev_road_trip/,True,0.78,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,15wfye5,,Callable CDs and YTC and YTW,"I am looking at callable CDs and I cannot figure out what YTC and YTW mean. Here is an example of what I am looking at for a two year CD (actual numbers captured from brokerage account):

>Maturity Date 09/02/2025  
>  
>Coupon Rate 5.500%  
>  
>Coupon Type Fixed  
>  
>Coupon Frequency Semi-annually  
>  
>Accrual Day Count Act/365  
>  
>Dated Date 08/30/2023  
>  
>First Settlement Date 08/30/2023  
>  
>First Coupon Date 02/29/2024  
>  
>Price -- 100.000  
>  
>Current Yield -- 5.500%  
>  
>Annual Percentage Yield (APY) -- 5.500%  
>  
>Yield To Call -- 5.500%  
>  
>Yield To Worst -- 5.500%  
>  
>Available Quantity 0 2165  
>  
>Trade Min/Increment 0 / 0 1 / 1  
>  
>Min/Increment 0 / 0 1 / 1

I assume this CD is callable at any time over the 2 year maturity period.

What I thought YTW meant was the minimum yield I would receive if the CD called before maturity. I would have expected that to be less then the coupon rate itself, so I must be misunderstanding what all of this means.

Does this all mean that I just receive the coupon rate up until the date of being called with interest accumulation ending at the call date? (Which I thought was just YTC).

investopedia: ""Yield to worst is a measure of the lowest possible yield that can be received on a bond that fully operates within the terms of its contract without defaulting.""

and

""If a bond is callable, it becomes important to look at the YTW. The yield to maturity will always be higher than the YTW (YTC) because the investor earns more when they hold the bond for its full maturity. The YTW is important though because it provides deeper due diligence on a bond with a call provision. The shorter time frame a bond is held for, the less the investor earns. YTW provides a clear calculation of this potential scenario showing the lowest yield possible.""

So, in my example above, YTM, YTC, and YTW are all the same. That doesn't make sense to me.

Can someone explain this to me?  Thank you!",1977,False,1692549164.0,2023-08-20 18:32:44,2,10,Slight-Studio-7667,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15wfye5/callable_cds_and_ytc_and_ytw/,True,0.6,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,15xs05u,,TESLA will Cyber Truck sell well and move share price to a new all time high?,"Have to be honest with you I don’t currently have a position in Tesla. But I am intrigued about what I’m hearing regarding the release of the cyber truck. Evidently they have a lot of orders currently with big deposits, along with a backlog of 1,900,000 orders waiting to be filled with a late 2023 or early 2024 release date.  
According to this article, that is a five-year backlog.  

“Tesla Cybertruck Orders Surpass 1.9 Million, 5 Year Wait Times” 

There are now over 1.9 million orders for the long-awaited Tesla Cybertruck, per a crowd-sourced data tracker. Speaking on an Earnings Call earlier this week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated that demand for the Cybertruck is ""so off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.”

Given that Tesla plans to produce 375,000 Cybertrucks a year at peak capacity, new orders will technically take around 5 years to arrive. 

It seems to me that Tesla would be a great place to jump in if it falls to $200 per share.  I don’t see it going much lower than $200.00 

Recent history:
52 week history $101.81 low and $313.00 high.

post,163mozx,,Volkswagen extremely undervalued??,"The market value for Volkswagen more or less correspond to the value of the 75% of the stocks they own in Porsche. The rest of the company you get for free... This seems like an incredible bargain. Maybe a bit too good to be true. What am I missing here?

""With today’s moves. Volkswagen stock, less the share of Porsche it owns, is worth almost nothing–about $1 billion. Porsche has a market capitalization of roughly $91 billion. VW owns about 80% of that stock, or almost $73 billion. And Volkswagen’s entire market capitalization is about $74 billion.(Adjusted for debt makes things look worse, it makes VW as an entity worth less than zero.)That value is despite estimates that VW operating profit in 2022, excluding all of Porsche’s earnings, should come to $13 billion or $14 billion.A company trading for 0.07 times 2022 operating profit ($1 billion divided by $13.5 billion) is hard to reconcile.

post,16bnu6p,,"Explaining the CyberTruck’s Depressing Inspiration: As Rivian instills a sense of adventure, the CyberTruck wants to romanticize survival in a fictional cyberpunk dystopia","So, listen… I’m really not impressed with the CyberTruck overall. I think it’s really ugly, impractical, and sort of, well, dumb. While we don’t know many details about the production model, it will most likely be capable — even if there’s a lot wrong with its functionality (most egregiously its sloped bed walls). But what I can’t stop thinking about is what CyberTrucks stand for.

I can’t imagine how people are going to react to these on the road. The design is so divisive and like nothing we’ve seen since the ill-fated DeLorean. That design is so important to Elon Musk it delayed the launch of the truck because it had to be built out of stainless steel to achieve its design goals. This required new production methods never before seen and whole bunch of considerations. I’m starting with this because it shows that the design of the CT is more important than just about anything else. I firmly believe Tesla could have made an equally capable truck a hell of a lot faster by using traditional materials. But they didn’t. They couldn’t. The design language of the CT is what makes it so special to Elon.

I’m genuinely shocked that Tesla let (now-legitimate) rival Rivian take such a massive first mover advantage to achieve its design which is credited for long production delays. Rivian has tens of thousands of trucks on the road today an is targeting a total of 52k produced this year. Rivian is cornering the “capable EV truck” market more every quarter. Just today I was walking to my R1T when I heard a family say, “Oh wow, another Rivian. There are lots of those everywhere now.” We’ll come back to comparing Rivian and Tesla again later in this post, but it’s no secret that CyberTruck’s success depends on enough people buying it that passersbys start to say the same thing. Time will tell if that happens, but, if it does, I’m pretty bummed out based on what the CyberTruck’s represents and its inspirations.

So, what inspired such an… ugly truck?

post,16fi3qv,,"After two years of waiting, I got my Z06. Here are my initial thoughts.","Tl;dr - I love it. **If it had a different interior, you'd swear while driving that it was made by an exotic manufacturer.** It is an improvement over the Stingray in every way and it's my favorite car that I've ever driven.

-----

Apologies in advance. I usually don't review things too much, but seeing as the Z06 is still relatively new, I figured I'd share some early thoughts. I've only got about 200 miles on it so far, so still in the engine break in period.

After putting down my deposit about two years ago and getting lucky to receive an ""early"" allocation at one of the big Corvette dealers, I finally received my Z06 a couple days ago.

You can probably already tell by my flair, but I also currently own a C8 Stingray. I've also recently (last two years or so) owned a 981 Cayman GTS, a Tesla Model 3, and a Mercedes C43 AMG. Also in the last couple years, I've been able to have quite a bit of seat time, either through rentals or friends, in an AMG GT, Huracan, 458, R8, Supra, and DB11. All that context to say that I like driving in general and there isn't one particular experience that I look for. I can enjoy small sports cars, luxury cars, old JDM cars, and whatever else.

---

***First impressions***

**The looks**

I mean, it's basically the same as the Stingray except for...

* It's a bit wider
* It has an updated front fascia
* The side boomerang is now a wishbone
* The exhaust is in the center of the rear rather than the corners

At this point, people have largely developed their own opinions on how the car looks. It isn't for everyone (with some people getting weirdly aggressive about how much they don't like it), but I really enjoy it. The Z06's changes give it better proportions, IMO, and fix some of the issues with the rear end on the Stingray.

**The interior**

...is the same as the Stingray. However, the cabin is much louder. The engineers programmed the exhaust to reflect a lot of noise back into the cabin.",6521,True,1694395639.0,2023-09-11 03:27:19,351,104,kuri-kuma,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/16fi3qv/after_two_years_of_waiting_i_got_my_z06_here_are/,True,0.87,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

I’m hoping someone tells me “your body will just get used to it, I was sick for a month before it got better” sort of thing. 

Any takers? Or is electric just not for me. (Or do I just need an S with the better suspension?).

post,16j8wdv,,What to focus on in last years before semi retirement,"My husband (m53) and I (f54) plan to downsize our home and work easier jobs in a couple of years as our jobs are super stressful. At that point we won’t be contributing toward retirement anymore, just paying bills. Together we gross $170 but take home a lot less due to various withdrawals. Anyway, we currently have extra money monthly and are deciding what makes the most sense as we get closer to when we’ll stop contributing.

My husband has a 401k and puts in 6% as his company matches 50% to a max of 3%.  He does that. Should we still contribute more to that?   Or

We have a HYSA at 25k. Should we add ti that so we have more liquid miney.

Or, should we be putting more in our traditional investment account?

When I leave work, I’ll have a pension if 38% if my pay for 7 years and another of 50% pay for life that is at its full amount when I turn 60, but I could take early with 120 days notice if we get stuck (I’ll be 56 when I leave work), and then Instill get social security, so except for health insurance, my pay is covered. His pay ($95k) is not, and he doesn’t have the education or skill to make that elsewhere. His plan is to work for health insurance, even if it is at Home Depot or the like for low pay until 60.  

By selling and buying with equity, along with my pension and our lower-pay jobs, we shouldn’t have to touch our investments too much until age 60.

* Meeting UAW's initial demand would increase total average hourly compensation from $66 to $136 an hour vs. $45 at Tesla, according to Wells Fargo.  They are asking for a 32-hour work week but annualized on a 40-hour week that would be approximately $283,000 in total compensation.
* It would further widen Tesla's tremendous advantage in efficiency as legacy automakers try to steer a costly transition to a future away from carbon emitting gas vehicles.

More than a day into the United Auto Workers strike against the Detroit automakers and one thing is clear: Elon Musk has already won.

And the billionaire tycoon isn’t even involved. 

Musk won before the strike began early Friday. He won before negotiations started two months ago. From the get-go, General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis were expected to spend more on wages because of the union’s pressure. The question is just how much of an increase, and so far their offers haven’t pleased the union, igniting this past week’s work stoppage.

post,16obp0z,,Proper built-in charger routing while navigating,"Hello all,

I'm doing research for my next company which has to be an EV due to new policies in my country.

I don't necessarily have range anxiety as I know cars charge fast enough and chargers are popping up all over the place.

However, one point that is important for me is a proper built-in charger routing while I'm navigating to my destination.

I'm using Tesla as a benchmark here:  
\* Built-in navigation system routes you via Superchargers if you need to charge  
\* Shows you how many chargers are in use, etc.  
\* Has up to date information (as far as I'm aware) so that it shows latest chargers  
\* The car is preconditioning the battery when it knows it will arrive at a Supercharger within x minutes.  
\* Shows new roads quite early on. The same way Google Maps or Apple Maps work, so offers free navigation updates.

\--> Due to this, a separate app on your phone like ABRP is not necessary; also not after 1 year of use when other cars' navigation maps are outdated.

Note: the Tesla Model Y is just within my budget, so any cars that are significantly more expensive I don't want to include.  


As I'm living in Europe, most EV's have a CCS connector, so the car is not limited only to non-Superchargers or vise versa.

I'm also aware that Google Maps and now also Apple Maps can show current status at chargers, but cars are not preconditioning when using these apps.

Could someone advice me which other EV's offer the same or similar EV routing function?  
I just don't want to limit myself to a Tesla. I prefer them, but I don't want to regret it later on when it appears other vehicles are doing a better job.

post,16uiioh,,How Much Is Tesla Worth? You Decide,"Wall Street Journal out with an article that lets you plug in 5 simple variables to get a valuation for Tesla.

The 5 variables are: how many cars Tesla sells in 2030, average selling price of a Tesla car in 2030 in today’s dollars, operating margin, cost of capital, and how much Tesla’s other operations are worth.

The Wall Street Journal has 4 pre-set scenarios:

1. Bearish - $58.5 billion valuation based on 5 million cars at $30k with 8% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $0 valuation for other operations besides cars

2. Default - $381 billion valuation based on 7 million cars at $30k with 10% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $200 billion valuation for other operations.

3. Bullish - $770 billion valuation based on 10 million cars at $30k with 12% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, $400 billion for other operations

4. Superfan - $2.33 trillion valuation based on 20 million cars at $30k with 15% operating margin, 8% cost of capital, $600 billion for other operations

Their assumptions are as follows:

> Our model is based on estimates of Tesla’s future cash flows. It multiplies anticipated vehicle sales in 2030 by the average anticipated price to calculate revenue, and then applies the expected operating margin to arrive at operating profit. Estimates for the years before 2030 assume a smooth path in the variables from this year’s FactSet analyst consensus.

> Operating profit is taxed at an 11% rate (FactSet consensus for Tesla in 2023). Cash flows are then calculated as posttax operating profit minus capital expenditures while adding back depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures are assumed to be a flat 7% of revenue and depreciation and amortization 20% of capital expenditures.

> Estimated cash flows through 2030 are discounted back to their present value at the discount rate and aggregated. A terminal value is added to account for Tesla’s cash flows beyond 2030, assuming a steady-state growth rate of 5%.",2699,True,1695913674.0,2023-09-28 17:07:54,0,36,32no,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/16uiioh/how_much_is_tesla_worth_you_decide/,True,0.47,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

The **EV Price Premium Tracker**, formerly the ""EV Price Parity Scorecard"", is an ongoing spreadsheet that shows the differences in MSRP between EVs and ICE vehicles in the same segment, from the same brand, configured to as close to feature parity as possible.

New for the Q3 2023 update are sheets comparing the EV pricing of ""modern OEMs"" such as Tesla, Rivian, and Fisker, with ICE models from both mainstream and premium segments. In addition, for all sheets, I have identified which model year's pricing / configuration is being compared. Finally, I have added info for many single-motor RWD model variants, as that was lacking before.

\--

At the current stage of the EV transition, there are three categories of ""class parity"" among vehicles from the same brand:

* EVs that are directly based off of existing ICE models (or the other way around). This includes the Volvo XC40 Recharge and the BMW i4.
* EVs that are their own models / platforms compared to ICEs, but that share the same naming structure and market positioning. This includes the Mercedes EQS SUV versus the GLS, the Audi Q8 e-Tron versus the Q8, and the Chevrolet Blazer EV versus the Blazer ICE.
* EVs that have no direct equivalent but can be matched with an equivalent ICE in the brand based on the body style, available features, and exterior and / or interior dimensions.

post,16zxqmv,,Modern cars(EV's in particular) are heading in the wrong direction,"Probably obvious to many of you as well, but it really hit me when I started car shopping recently and revisited some cars I'd be been interested in such as the F150 lightning and Mercedes EQS SUV.

1.**Subscriptions.** Many of us have griped about it, but I was blown away by how many things Mercedes wanted to charge for, even extra \*degrees\* of tire turning. It's absolutely insane and immediately soured me on the EQS SUV. Ford is charging $2500 for BlueCruise...ongoing, which is nuts. Yes they have to map things and pay their employees, but $2500 ongoing?

2.**Size.** The F150 I can kind of forgive as it's pretty much the same as most modern trucks and they're all getting bigger and more annoyingly, \*taller\*; which is very harrowing for someone that currently drives a sedan. I am either being blinded by their lights, or tailgated and the height of the trucks really driving up my stress levels. Especially when some of these people are on their phones or just being dicks. Ironically this is part of the reason that I've been eyeing either an SUV or a truck for my next vehicle, because I just do not feel comfortable driving around these monstrosities, especially the ones jacked up to heaven.

3.**Pricing.** This is more about the EV's. I get it, mostly newer tech, yada, yada. But it's been a while now since EV's have been sold to the masses and while the cost to run may be very enticing, the cost to purchase is not. A lot of the discounts or government grants are very specific, there's new taxes implemented as well and there's really not much around 35k that seems worth it if you have or want a family, or even just like traveling a lot. I would be fine(would even prefer) a midsize SUV or hatchback even that seats 5-6 adults/teens, has ample room, good range and doesn't cost over 35k. No such vehicle exists.

Tesla’s Model Y Performance sports utility vehicle now starts at $52,490, down from a previous price of $54,490.

Beginning at the end of last year, Tesla began cutting the prices of its cars across the world in a bid to stoke demand amid concerns over slowing consumer spending in markets like the U.S. and China and as competition in the electric vehicle space ramped up.",1430,False,1696600916.0,2023-10-06 16:01:56,639,429,ThinkBigger01,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/171d3yd/tesla_cuts_model_3_and_model_y_prices_in_the_us/,True,0.93,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Bluetooth sound quality improved.We bought a new electric SUV here in the Netherlands. A shamelessly Chinese Xpeng G9 and we are among the first to own it outside of China.

* Battery capacity can now also be displayed in percentage.
* Charging stations in navigation can now be filtered by charging capacity.
* German language setting is now possible.
* Fewer disclaimers for apps.
* Improving the translation of functions in Dutch and other languages.
* DSM (driver monitoring system) can now have 3 different sensitivities: low/normal/high. High is what the standard was before the update.
* LSS (Lane support system): number of warnings significantly reduced to the most necessary and legally necessary. Less vibrations on the handlebars.
* IHB (intelligent high beam): Should be more precise, turn off the lights earlier to avoid annoying oncoming traffic. Should be better on highways too.
* X-Pilot ACC (adaptive cruise control): should work more ""smoothly"", less braking by parked cars at the edge of the street. Also improved logic in processing speed limit changes. Now automatically maintains speed when switching from LCC to ACC by steering movement.
* X-Pilot LCC (Lane Centering Control): Traffic light detection has now been added and appears at the top of the driver's dashboard. Optimization of acceleration and braking, so less slow acceleration and less sudden braking, even when drivers merge in front of you into your lane. Also less delay in corners and less chance of the system switching itself off.
* ALC (automatic lane shift assistant): Feedback has been improved and timing of acceleration after the lane change has taken place has been improved. ALC should be able to be the primary means of lane changing on the highway.
* APA (intelligent park assist): Has become better at parking in spaces. Better comfort due to fewer sudden movements during parking.",14854,True,1696633966.0,2023-10-07 01:12:46,173,141,Goldstein_Goldberg,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/171qtir/a_one_week_review_of_our_new_xpeng_g9_in_the/,True,0.91,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Tesla's China-made car deliveries fell by 10.9% in September, pushing its shares down 1.8% in premarket trading. The EV giant sold 74,072 units, with Model 3 and Model Y sales dropping by 12% from the previous month. This slump highlights the growing competition in China's auto market, especially as Tesla's key competitor, BYD, reported a 42.8% surge in passenger deliveries for the same month. Despite these challenges, Tesla's market share in China nearly doubled from July to August. 

Separately, Disney's shares rose after Trian Fund Management, led by Nelson Peltz, significantly increased its stake in the company, hinting at seeking more control.

As a side note and correct me if I'm wrong, if Cybertruck is used as a work truck for business, wouldn't a business owner be able to write it off 100% as an expense as long as it met a specific weight requirement?

post,174vjgo,,My thoughts as a Model Y Lessee > Lucid Air Pure Lessee,"I leased a Model Y Performance, fully loaded in Sept 2020.  I had some minor issues with it over time, but honestly it was one of the most exciting, fun and reliable vehicles I've ever driven. *No, I will not be discussing charging infrastructure here because I haven't yet roadtripped in the Air -- but the range, so far, in the Air seems REAL and ACCURATE, vs the MYP.*

--

My main complaints with the MYP were the EXTREMELY uncomfortably hard sport suspension and the increasingly hazardous support infrastructure at Tesla where getting in touch with a human and/or scheduling appointments was awful.  Also I'm not an Elon fan, but that wasn't a make-or-break.

In the run up to end of lease, I tried to buy a used 2021 Model S LR+, I wanted the luxury and increased range, and it felt like a safe bet cost-wise though it was probably higher than I wanted to put down with interest rates and all.  I paid money to ship it to the east coast from the west coast, plus a small deposit.  The week before delivery, Tesla dropped new vehicle prices for the S and X.  This absolutely torpedoed the value of the car I'd just spent money sending to the east coast.  Long story short, Tesla is VERY non-communicative and I ended up walking away from it.

In my search for another car, I stumbled across the latest round of lower lease prices being offered by Lucid on the Air Pure -- being in the northeast, I wanted AWD and all told it checked all the same boxes the Model S did but it was (1) new; (2) more beautiful; (3) longer range; (4) featured better quality materials.  After some negotiation, I came away paying less for it monthly than I did the MYP.

My experience with Lucid has been as follows:

1. Unlike Tesla, they are HUNGRY.  They are responsive, their team is on standby and will reply even by text message -- personally.  They are friendly and follow through and are thorough.

post,17hklip,,Real World EV Road Trip,"Rightfully so there is a lot of debate on how effective current EVs are in anything but around-town driving. 

I thought I’d share the results of my 1000+ mile road trip in an EV to paint a real world picture to contribute to the debate.  I’m trying to keep this only about the numbers ie cost and time of charging on the roads and let the reader make their own decisions.

The trip: from Louisville KY to Madison WI and back (total trip 1085 miles) for a wedding over a long wknd in a Tesla Model Y:

1.	⁠Left Thursday evening after work, drove to hotel (Hilton chain) on the north side of Indianapolis, 125 miles.  Used their free charger to recharge to 100% while I slept.

2.	⁠Woke up Friday, drove 219 miles to a Tesla Supercharger in Peru, IL at a Hy-Vee grocery store. Charged to 92% in 40 minutes while we ate lunch, got groceries for our weekend, picked out a card for the wedding, etc. Charging cost $26.52

3.	⁠Drove the remainder of the trip to wedding location Friday afternoon. 171 miles. Plugged into a regular 120V outlet at our Airbnb to charge while the car was parked. Drove to and from various things like rehearsal dinner, sight seeing, etc.

4.	⁠Woke up Sunday morning and left with a 70% charge. Drove 125 miles to Tesla Supercharger in Rochelle IL. Charged to 80% in 25 mins while taking bathroom break, snacks, etc.  Cost $20.52

5.	⁠Drove 161 miles to Tesla Supercharger in Urbana IL. Add 54% to the battery in 20 minutes, went to the bathroom, watched part of Netflix episode. Cost $16.34

6.	⁠Drove 130 miles to Indy Supercharger, ate lunch at Jimmy John’s while charging. 25 minutes. Cost $19.50.

7.	⁠Drove the remaining 112 miles home; arrive with 25% charge. Put the car on the charger at home.

Total charging cost: $82.88. If we would have drove my wife’s Toyota (averaging 32 MPG, avg gallon of gas in the region at the time $3.70) it would have cost $127.19 in gas.

* [Latest EV news](https://evtable.com/news/), curated toward the substantive things like new cars being announced.

If you find [evtable.com](https://evtable.com) helpful:

* Think of the 1-2 people you know who are in the market for a new electric vehicle, and send them the site
* Subscribe to the email newsletter so you hear about major site and car updates (literally I've sent 1 of these in 3 months though, so trying to keep it to the good stuff)

Despite strong growth, weakness has begun to present itself within the Wall Street prince in the past year. Tesla announced earlier in February 2023 that it would be cutting prices on the Model Y. This move surprised investors because, before the price cuts, Tesla appeared to be entirely supply-side constrained. However, investors noted that these cuts only impacted higher-end models that were outside the range of the mass vehicle market. However, in April, Tesla announced that it would be cutting prices on the Model 3. Elon Musk has previously alluded to a poor performing EV market in the wake of a higher interest rate environment. Economic data confirms this narrative as Automobile shipments have declined substantially in Q3’ 2023.

However, two factors that cannot be explained by an adverse economic environment are Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Cybertruck demand. FSD is Tesla’s end-to-end autonomous driving solution.

Tesla’s FSD is considered a level 2 autonomous driving solution. Level 2 systems require the driver to remain alert at all times with the anticipation that driver will have to take over in every circumstance. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly claimed that FSD would be finished by the end of the year for the past six years. Additionally, Musk has claimed that robo-taxis, completely automated taxi services would be available during the same timeframes. Tesla’s current FSD beta boasts some impressive technologies, including the ability to navigate through city streets without immediate intervention in many cases. However, level 3 seems to be uncertain  for the car company.",3215,True,1698591587.0,2023-10-29 15:59:47,357,543,TheMorningTraffic,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17j4q1u/we_should_start_worrying_about_tesla_tsla/,True,0.76,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

post,17osjlf,,Pics of Stealth Grey next to Midnight Silver,"I thought this might be useful for those that want a better idea as to what Stealth Grey looks like in person. I called my local dealer to see if they had any in stock and the guy on the phone told me to hurry over because they had one next to a grey Model 3. 

Some things I noticed: I see why they call it Stealth, because the color changes pretty drastically depending on the light and angle. Walking up to it I thought the guy was mistaken and that he was showing me a black Model X. Up close, it looks like a darker version of the existing Model 3 grey. 

I’m purchasing a Model S Plaid as they are letting me transfer over my unlimited supercharging (2018 Model S 75D) and I was torn between Black and Stealth Grey. After seeing it in person I opted for Stealth Grey! Delivery is Nov/Dec.

post,17przt8,,Cathie Wood has a blunt warning about Tesla's stock over the coming months,"Ark Invest, a firm known for its bullish stance on Elon Musk and Tesla, believes that Tesla is well-positioned to dominate the self-driving cars and robotaxi fleet industry, which it anticipates could be worth up to $10 trillion by 2030. In April, Ark projected that Tesla's stock could reach $2,000 per share by 2027. Despite weak quarterly earnings and falling gross margins, Ark remains confident in Tesla's potential due to its focus on robotaxis.

However, Ark has been reducing its Tesla holdings in recent months, even as the stock experiences volatility. Their flagship Innovation ETF owned around 3.5 million Tesla shares in June, but by October 23, that number had fallen to 2.6 million shares, valued at $549.8 million. Despite this, Cathie Wood, Ark's CEO and investment lead, is still optimistic about their Tesla holdings.

Wood explained that Ark sells Tesla shares when the stock outperforms and reinvests in stocks with short-term concerns or significant underperformance relative to Tesla. They aim to increase their Tesla holdings during periods of stock underperformance.

Wood is also looking forward to the release of the Cybertruck in November, but she acknowledges potential near-term challenges and controversy, particularly related to profitability and scaling. Musk has indicated that the Cybertruck might not be profitable until scaling issues are addressed, which could take up to 18 months. Wood believes that the Cybertruck could be the next significant growth driver for Tesla.

post,17qznaf,,8 Reasons to Enter 8th Annual Climate XChange EV Raffle - and some questions,"I manage this 501c3 nonprofit fundraising raffle, and work with the winners to select and order their vehicles - which we then pay for. For six years it was a Tesla raffle; last year it started as a Tesla raffle but we added Rivian R1T and R1S options mid-stream, though the winner chose a Model X. This year I may be a bit crazy to be offering any EV, but we had feedback that people wanted more options than just Teslas and Rivians. There are some restrictions, the most important being the price and delivery date (we need to close out the raffle within our fiscal year):

1. The vehicle must be a fully battery-powered electric vehicle, not a hybrid or plug-in hybrid.
2. It must be a new vehicle offered for sale direct from the manufacturer or by a brand-authorized dealer.
3. Its price must fit within the Prize Vehicle Payout of $112,835, or the winner must pay any overage; in no case will Climate XChange pay above the Prize Vehicle Payout.
4. It must be readily available for delivery, so that the transaction can take place and payment from Climate XChange can be completed by June 30, 2024. If it is apparent on June 15, 2024 that this deadline cannot be met, the prize will default to the Alternate All-Cash Prize of $100,000.

So I've clearly opened myself up to potentially a lot more work this year. What EVs will be easy to find between the 2/29/24 drawing and our 6/30/24 deadline? What won't be? And what would you choose?

post,17ujkrp,,"Net Lease Office Properties (NLOP) - A classic ""toxic waste"" spinoff (Long thesis)","I tried posting this to r/stocks, but it was removed because the market cap is below 300m. As a result, you may see that the price I reference is no longer up to date. It was $13/sh a few days ago, and is now $15.50/sh but I believe it's still undervalued. I'm always trying to improve, so was hoping to get some feedback from any knowledgeable or experienced investors. Thanks for reading!

**THESIS SUMMARY**  
As of Nov 1, 2023, Net Lease Office Properties (NLOP) is a tiny, ugly, spinoff of W. P. Carey Inc (WPC). No one likes this thing. Due to poor sentiment, poor spinoff execution, a bad spin ratio, a large difference between the asset type of the Parent and SpinCo, uncertainty about the value of its assets, and even just the size of the company (sub-200m market cap), it's currently undergoing a heavy sell-off. Management from the Parent are going to also be running NLOP. They're going to be issued 750k shares and 1.5m options which haven't been struck yet, so they're incentivized to see a low initial trading price for the shares. NLOP's assets are high quality (even more so considering the craziness surrounding the office property industry at the moment), with large stable tenants, a reasonable WALT, and a low vacancy rate. Adjusted book value is 3.7x their current price. This book value will be realized over the next few years because the purpose of spinning off NLOP was to liquidate the assets without a fire sale. Oh, and the cherry on top is a likely 16%+ annual dividend while you wait for the properties to be sold.

W. P. Carey Inc (WPC) is a multi-billion dollar REIT that owns a variety of properties spanning Industrial, Retail, Warehouse, Office, and Self-Storage.

post,17v936i,,When renting a Model 3 be prepared,"Wanted to share a quick experience with renting an EV from Budget. This past weekend I rented a Tesla Model 3 or “or similar” from Budget for a 1200 round trip that would be completed in 36 hours. 

I’ve owned a model S in the past and am familiar with the supercharging system. This trip would be a breeze with that network and the basic autopilot that helps with driving fatigue. I was very excited to try the 3 and even mapped out my whole route lying in bed the evening prior. 

When I l arrived to pickup the car they immediately inform me they do not have model 3’s but they have an Ioniq 5 or a Bolt. The rep said that particular location doesn’t have model 3’s at all. I was very naive as it never occurred to me that I might not get a model 3. I was immediately concerned about making this trip after reading so many negative stories about it the CCS network reliability and availability. I also was disappointed because I knew nothing about those cars driver assist capabilities. 

Anyways, I opted for the Ioniq with a 35% charge instead of a Corolla and decided to make it an adventure learning about non-supercharging trips. All in all, I loved the Ioniq and only had one bad fast charging experience at an EVgo location. I would happily rent that car again. 

Next time I will call ahead to see what the true availability is.

Baidu operates robotaxi with those giant lidars just like Waymo in US. However, without the large lidar or HDmap, its demo of its first EV is pretty bad. The route is an easy suburb one, nowhere near the most complex city center streets.

These two tech giants with tens of thousands of AI engineers are still struggling in a suburb of one city. XPeng's NGP is available for users in 29 cities, soon 54. 

Still don't believe XPeng is the one champion? VW bought into XPeng for its tech. VW EVs designed by XPeng will be launched next year. Tesla's FSD will be facing VWs with NGP in US in the near future. Didi, Uber of China, is partnering with XPeng too, guaranteeing 360k units sales of XPeng's Mona EV models over two years to take 5% shares of XPEV. Why would a ridehail operator guarantee EV sales? Because they will purchase units themselves for robotaxi operations. Finally, NVDA is partnering with XPeng, designing vehicle AI chips just for XPeng, which has requested less powerful and expensive chips. XPeng's software is so good that it can start to cut hardware costs. CEO of NVidia, Jensen, personally visited XPeng to receive head of NGP for a VP position in Nvidia. (Career move for immigrating to US.)

post,17yx246,,Do you think electricity or gas will increase more yoy over the next 10yrs? EV vs ICE analysis,"I have been going down a rabbit hole of potentially buy an EV and it’s been astonishing to me, especially living in California, how unattractive it is to buy an EV. 

I will give you a few reasons why:

-I have to upgrade my electric panel to support charging 
-I have to switch to an EV plan through PG&E, which increases my partial and peak kilowatt an hour here is the breakdown of my summer rates (winter is lower by like 10 cents for both plans)

- **E-TOU-C** (current plan)
  - Peak (4-9 PM): 54 cents/kWh
  - Off-Peak: 46 cents/kWh
  - Lower rates for usage within Baseline Allowance.

- **EV2**:
  - Peak (4-9 PM): 59.068 cents/kWh
  - Part-Peak (3-4 PM & 9-12 AM): 48.019 cents/kWh
  - Off-Peak (All other hours): 27.818 cents/kWh
  - Delivery Minimum Bill: $0.37612 per meter per day.

-I have to pay someone to install a wall charger. Got a quote for $1900

-I have to pay an additional $103 a year to register an EV in CA

-On top of all these fees I don’t even qualify for many incentives as as a household we make over 300k which is honestly nothing crazy for coastal California when you factor in living expenses.

With all of these additional upfront costs and insane electric prices how does California expect people to adopt EVs? 

I really want to buy one but it seems like more of a statement play and potential car performance play then a smart economic choice. 

I did a cost comparison between a used Tesla Model X, a new Ford F-150 Lightning, and a new Toyota Grand Highlander Hybrid. Here's a summary including assumptions and formulas used.

**Assumptions:**
- Prices: $70,000 for the Tesla Model X, $65,500 for the Ford F-150 Lightning (after rebate), $56,000 for the Toyota Grand Highlander Hybrid.
- Annual miles driven: 13,500.
- Gas price: $5.73/gallon, Electricity price: $0.27/kWh.
- Toyota MPG: 31.
- EV maintenance costs are 60% of a gas vehicle's maintenance.

post,17zyjos,,"What I test drove, what I bought, and why","I just bought my first EV (yay!) and thought I would share my shopping experience in case it helps anyone. It's long...

Importantly, if I lived somewhere other than where I am now, I might have made a different choice. I lived in San Diego for quite a few years, and now live in western Mass. Might have made different choices if I was still in SD.

What we looked at/drove:

1a. Hyundai Ioniq 5. The first to look at... we didn't drive it the first time because my husband veto'd it. He thought it was too small (it's not) and was still not sold on 100% electric. More on this later.

1b. We also looked at the Santa Fe PHEV at the same dealer. The trim felt a bit cheap, but I wasn't really serious about it because I knew I would eventually win the all EV battle. 

2. Volkswagen ID.4. Also didnt drive. I liked the look of it, husband didn't like the trim. For a small SUV/crossover, the trunk seemed a bit small for golf clubs. Dealership seemed really invested in selling EVs - they had a EV specialist that was busy when we were there, but even the non-specialist seemed very well informed. Husband was still holding out for PHEV, so he might have just been grumpy when we looked at it.

3. Nissan Ariya. First one I drove, took out the FWD version. More than any other car, it felt like an ICE. Both in the interior appointments (which maybe some folks like) but also in the driving feel. Sure, it was zippyier than our ICE, but I expected a bit more and was kinda disappointed. I suspect the AWD might have felt better. A rare FWD instead of RWD for an EV non-AWD version. No ""real"" one pedal driving. I wasn't sold for these reasons....
(The very young salesman did tell us a nice story during our drive about how last summer he hitchhiked all through western Mass because he was growing weed in the forest). 

4. Ford Mustang Mach e AWD. I really liked this car. A lot. Really, really a lot.

post,180ogg2,,Doug Demuro reviews the new Kia EV9.,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqkUkQyhBbc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqkUkQyhBbc)

Some interesting thoughts.  First, it's about the same length as a Telluride, but the wheelbase is a lot longer, they shifted the wheels further apart to focus on interior space, so that could make this punch above its weight and feel more like a full-size inside.

Base power for $56,000 is actually pretty underwhelming, only 215 horsepower with a RWD setup that gets 230 miles.  You can upgrade to extended range for 300+ miles, or you can upgrade to AWD which gets you 380 horsepower and 280 miles.  Definitely better, but it's no Mach-E GT (though to be fair, it's not really trying to be.)

I think really my main criticism is just that it's still way too expensive.  This starts at $56,000, and yes there will certainly be rebates, but a Telluride starts at the mid $36,000 range and its competitors like the Pilot and Highlander also start under $40,000.  We're still in this same problem period where the EV version of a gas vehicle is like 30-50% more expensive, so you have to not only be willing to commit to EV, you have to be willing to commit enough to spend $20,000 more for the privilege.

The GT-Line especially that he reviews is around $75,000, putting it up against the Rivian R1S and Model X, but also pretty close to traditional high-luxury SUV's like the Escalade, and obviously this will be cheaper to run than an Escalade, but my point is just that you can get a lot of amenities around the $80,000 range, and I'm not sure how many people would be willing to spend this much....for a Kia.",1606,False,1700593153.0,2023-11-21 19:59:13,0,62,Aromatic_Wallaby_433,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/180ogg2/doug_demuro_reviews_the_new_kia_ev9/,True,0.41,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1862zhv,,F150 Lightning - Thanksgiving Trip Report: Austin to Omaha,"**Pre-trip:**

After a successful Texas to [Colorado EV road trip](https://www.reddit.com/r/F150Lightning/comments/15wpuez/2500_mile_trip_report_in_my_lariat_er/) this summer, my wife and I decided to forgo our PHEV Volvo and take the Lightning up to Omaha for Thanksgiving. Although I was a little concerned with the lower temperatures up north, after creating a route in ABRP I was confident the truck would be able to make the trip. With our dog and an 8-month-old along for the ride, the goal of this trip was not to min-max charging and stop time but to simply arrive with all passengers happy and not stranded on the side of the road. We made more stops than if we didn’t have the baby with us and I typically charged the truck to at least 80% instead of leaving once I had the minimum charge needed to reach the next charger. Even with the extra charging time, the truck was usually ready to go before we were. This will probably change once our son is older, but the baby helps mask the Lightning’s longer charging time to 80%. In an ICE, the trip to Omaha from Austin is a 12-hour drive on paper without stops and about 13.5 hours with stops and traffic. In the Lightning, ABRP predicted 16 hours. We opted to break the trip into two days with a stop overnight in Oklahoma City each way.

I purchased a month of EA Pass+ for the discount pricing. It saved me a significant amount of money on my Colorado trip, and I highly recommend you sign up before any road trip you take. Although EA has a reputation of being unreliable/slow, that was not my experience on the last road trip, but I didn’t keep great records of each stop. I felt my experience was too subjective. This time around I kept very detailed records of each charge to better quantify the quality of the DCFC sessions.

* Cold tire pressure set to 47 psi

post,1864wq2,,"My thoughts on upgrading from a 2022 Model 3 Performance to a Model S (standard, not Plaid)","TLDR; If you are driving a Model 3 Performance, the base Model S with standard wheels is a *very* nice upgrade.

Context: I had a 2019 Model 3 Performance. Loved it. It was leased, so switched to a 2022 Model 3 Performance. The 2019 had better fit and finish than the 2022. The 2022's battery also degraded faster than the older car. I probably lucked out and got a peach 2019, but whatever. Both cars were excellent fun. That said, the crashy suspension was starting to annoy me, and I wanted more range. So got a base 2023 Model S with the standard wheels for range and comfort. Ordered Midnight Silver, it got changed to Stealth Grey.

So here are my thoughts on the differences between a Model 3 Performance and a standard Model S:

 - The Model S is much better looking (duh).
 - The fit and finish is pretty good - the panel gaps are a little wider than I would like, but I don't have any alignment issues. It is better than the Model 3 - my Model 3's trunk was slightly out of square, causing a slight jiggle when closing.
 - The initial paint quality is excellent. So was the Model 3. As to how it holds up over time, I do not know. I have PPF on the front.
 - The performance is similar. I know it is supposed to be a bit faster (same 0 to 60, but the Model S measures it without the 1 foot rollout) but the difference is too small to notice. They are both so, so fast.
 - The handling is good, but I can feel that the car is larger to drive. I have to pay a bit more attention to keep the car centered in the lane and when turning. As for actual handling, I don't drive at the limit, so both seem equally capable to me.
 - The S is *much* more comfortable! I knew that going in, but the difference is pretty stark. Now, I probably would have had better comfort if I had the standard wheels on my Model 3 rather than the larger performance wheels, but I still think the S is more comfortable.
 - The S is much quieter inside. Much less noise coming in from the outside.",4587,True,1701201003.0,2023-11-28 20:50:03,316,224,syslog2000,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1864wq2/my_thoughts_on_upgrading_from_a_2022_model_3/,True,0.89,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,18b05xu,,New Cybertruck EPA & CARB Certifications Spotted,"Within the last 24 hours several new Cybertruck documents have appeared on the EPA's website:

[Application for Cybertruck Beast](https://dis.epa.gov/otaqpub/display_file.jsp?docid=58898&flag=1)

[Application for Cybertruck AWD](https://dis.epa.gov/otaqpub/display_file.jsp?docid=58897&flag=1)

[Certificate Summary Information for Cybertruck Beast](https://dis.epa.gov/otaqpub/display_file.jsp?docid=58896&flag=1)

[Certificate Summary Information for Cybertruck AWD](https://dis.epa.gov/otaqpub/display_file.jsp?docid=58895&flag=1)

Usually the applications contain test results for the EPA's highway & city range cycles, though these initial submissions only contain dummy data and as such the official EPA rated range is not yet known, however some interesting details can still be gleaned:

* Both trucks feature a nominal 816 V and 150 Ah pack making for a pack size of about 122.4 kWh, which is in line with current speculation of 123 kWh
* The Beast variant features two rear permanent magnet motors making 212 kW (284 hp) each while the front permanent magnet motor makes 206 kW (276 hp)
* The AWD variant has an AC induction motor in front and permanent magnet motor in rear rated at 226 kW (303 hp) and 222 kW (297 hp)
* Curb weights are 6669 lbs (AWD) and 6898 lbs (Beast)

As part of the certification process Tesla is required to submit settings for dynamometer calibration by performing a Coastdown test in accordance with [standardized test procedures](https://dis.epa.gov/otaqpub/display_file.jsp?docid=34102&flag=1).  From these settings one can determine the Vehicle Road-Load Force experienced at various speeds, letting you plot an efficiency curve that can be directly compared to other vehicles using their EPA submissions.  Here are these curves for the Cybertruck against some existing EV trucks:

post,18ex45r,,Small comparison,"I have had the opportunity to drive 3 EVs, the Kia EV6, the Model Y, and the Mach-E (which I own). I have some thoughts, and I thought I would share them in case someone else is trying to make a buying decision and isn’t sure what to buy.

Let’s talk about the Model Y first, especially since it is the best selling car in America right now. I got it as a rental for a few days while running some errands around town, and it is honestly a really good car. It charges fast, the screen provides a ton of information, it is quick, and it handles like a much smaller vehicle. That is where my positivity about this vehicle stops. The build quality that often gets discussed isn’t a big deal, but it feels extremely spartan in the interior. Everything being on the screen means that I am looking farther to my right whenever I need to check the map to see where I am going. That leads to me not paying enough attention to what is in front of me, which, when I was relying on autopilot caused emergency braking to activate on the highway. Autopilot is a substandard system in this day and age, especially with the multiple phantom braking instances I dealt with. Parking with vision only is garbage, you can’t trust it enough to rely on it, so I had to repark a few times (but this could also just be due to me not feeling comfortable).  ~~And for all the hype about the software, not being able to use android auto or apple carplay is stupid, since I would be googling where I am going to type the address into the Tesla Nav (A waste of time)~~ (You can apparently send it to the car through the app. My bad.) . Finally, I had the screen just shut down on me while driving back from the grocery store, which legitimately felt like an unsafe situation since I was driving pretty much blind in regards to my speed.

# [Stock futures tick higher as traders await Fed decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/12/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures ticked higher Wednesday as investors await the Federal Reserve’s latest policy decision.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose by 42 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.1% each.
*****
> The central bank is widely anticipated to hold the benchmark overnight borrowing rate steady in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, but investors will also parse through Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for clues into how soon rate cuts can be expected. As it is, the CME FedWatch Tool shows markets are pricing in odds of rate cuts beginning next spring.
*****
> But that’s a scenario Powell may choose to push back on, especially as Treasury yields pull back on their own. The 10-year Treasury yield has fallen to 4.2% after topping 5% in October.
*****
> “He may hint that’s doing some of the prospective easing,” Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
> “That’s, to me, what I’m going to be focused on, is whether he sort of does the opposite of what he did when he said that the move up in yields had done some of the tightening for the Fed,” Sonders added.
*****
> Investors will also keep an eye on the November producer price index, set for release 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday ahead of the Fed decision. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a rise of 0.1%, up from a 0.5% decline the prior month. Excluding food and energy, it’s anticipated to have risen 0.2%, up from a flat reading the previous month.

post,18lyz17,,"Is Tesla the Ultimate Investment? Garry Breaks Down the Numbers, Growth, and Unveils the EV Game-Changer!","According to Garry, Investment advisor,Tesla ($TSLA) currently sits at $250 per share, trading at 58 times his estimated 2024 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $4.30. Garry's take on this? He believes it's a reasonable valuation, especially when considering the projected +28% increase in volume and an impressive +32% growth in EPS between now and 2030. This positions Tesla's Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio at 1.8x, notably lower than Apple's ($AAPL) 3.0x PEG.

Garry's outlook extends to global EV adoption, forecasting a rise from the current 13% to a substantial 60% by 2030, sporting a +24% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CGR). With faith in the Cybertruck and Tesla's $25,000 next-gen vehicle, Garry expects Tesla to boost its global EV market share from 16% to 20% by 2030. The outcome? Tesla's vehicle volumes surging from 1.8 million in 2023 to 2.4 million in 2024 and an impressive 10.2 million by 2030 (+28% CGR).

Factoring in aspects like auto gross margin expansion, contributions from energy, operating leverage, and cash reinvestment, Garry foresees Tesla's Adjusted EPS climbing from $3.20 in 2023 to $22 in 2030 (+32% CGR). Interestingly, Garry's projections don't include potential revenues from Full Self-Driving (FSD) licensing, robotaxi ventures, or other futuristic elements. However, they do consider FSD at a 15% global take rate and energy revenues rising by a factor of eight.

The central question, as per Garry's analysis, is whether a P/E ratio of 58x is too steep for the premier EV player, set to experience a +28% CGR in volume and +32% CGR in EPS. Garry challenges you to find another mega-cap stock with this level of growth and valuation, particularly with traditional automakers pulling back from their EV commitments. In his view, Tesla stands out as the primary investment opportunity in the evolving EV landscape.",1861,False,1702982362.0,2023-12-19 11:39:22,0,4,yogi2350,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18lyz17/is_tesla_the_ultimate_investment_garry_breaks/,True,0.2,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,18m38qb,,Toyota Industries to Increase Supply to Tesla by 2.5 Times for EV-Use Electric Compressors,"Translated from japanese

Toyota Industries will expand its supply of electric compressors for electric vehicle (EV) air conditioners to Tesla. The company has a 70% share of the market for this component in Tesla vehicles, and it expects to ship 2.5 times as many units in 2026 as it did in 2022, for a total of about 2.5 million units. Toyota is also working to strengthen its production base to meet the growing demand from European and American automakers that are leading the EV market.

According to interviews with industry insiders, electric compressors are the heart of car air conditioners, which regulate the temperature inside the car. The compressor compresses the refrigerant, making it hot, and then expands it, creating cold air. In electric vehicles (EVs), electric compressors also play a role in cooling the battery and heating the cabin, and they are required to have high performance.

Toyota Industries provides electric compressors for Tesla's main sedan, the Model 3, as well as the versatile sports utility vehicles (SUVs) Model Y and Model X. While Tesla began shipping its electric pickup truck, the Cybertruck, at the end of November, Toyota lost a bidding competition for supplying components for that model. Despite this setback, they are intensifying efforts to secure contracts for other vehicle models by actively promoting their electric compressors.

Tesla's 2022 electric vehicle (EV) production increased 47% from the previous year to approximately 1.37 million units. Tesla plans to introduce new models and expand its factories in the future. S&P Global Mobility, a research firm, estimates that Tesla's production will reach 3.65 million units in 2026. Toyota's shipments of electric compressors to Tesla were approximately 1 million units in 2022, but are expected to expand to approximately 2.5 million units in 2026.

In response to the global shift to electrification, Toyota Industries is strengthening its production base for electric compressors.",4452,True,1702996339.0,2023-12-19 15:32:19,98,99,deppaotoko,electricvehicles,https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOFD293GB0Z21C23A1000000/,False,0.92,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,18m9qyj,,Active Investing? Really?,"Not that I trust the first article I read but saw this on CNN today. Jack Manley, global market strategist at JPMorgan says that active investing is the way to go in 2024. I am curious to know what folks on this thread think.

Given below is a link to the article and a copy-paste of the relevant section. 

[https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/19/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/19/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html)

It’s all about active management   
  
A common theme across 2024 outlooks is that investors will do well to actively manage their portfolios next year. That’s a bit different than the ‘set it and forget it’ long-run investment advice that typically prevails among portfolio managers.  
  
Stocks and bonds have been unusually volatile this year, behaving in ways that aren’t consistent with economic expectations, wrote Jack Manley, global market strategist at JPMorgan. Given those “significant dislocations,” he said “simply owning the indices will not suffice.”  
  
That means an investment strategy that relies on broad market movements to generate returns, rather than on specific stock selection or other active management strategies, may fall short.  
  
“Investors need to take a more active approach to their portfolios. This is not a time to switch on the investing autopilot; it’s a time to take the controls,” wrote analysts at BlackRock. “It’s important to be deliberate in taking portfolio risk, in our view, and we expect to deploy more risk over the next year.”",1553,False,1703012980.0,2023-12-19 20:09:40,19,46,National-Ad8416,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18m9qyj/active_investing_really/,True,0.72,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,18nz6j0,,I bought my first EV. This is why I picked the RS e-Tron GT (and was it worth it...?),"Ok, so first, full disclosure, I didn't actually buy it. I leased it. For a year. Because things are changing so rapidly (e.g. NACS becoming a standard, solid state batteries, etc.) that I didn't want to be stuck making payments on outdated tech. But I also wanted an EV, partly because my other daily is a gas guzzler and I felt bad, partly because I wanted to make a difference, partly because buying gas sucks, and partly because I was having a serious case of FOMO and wanted in on the new and shiny. This is my journey:

**My Requirements**

1. BEV
2. Sedan or coupe
3. Sexy
4. Luxury car
5. AWD for winter driving
6. Not a Tesla.

That's really it. I had a lot of range in budget, size, brand, etc. I just knew I wanted an EV that was at least as nice as the CLS450 it was replacing.

**The Competition, or What Did I Look At?**

* ***Tesla Model S Plaid:*** Obviously if you're going to look at higher-end EVs, you have to start with the king (even though I had already made up my mind not to support Musk for all sorts of reasons.) The king, it turns out, isn't wearing any clothes. The MSP is awful. It's basically a classic American muscle car, but in all the worst ways. Build quality is much improved over earlier generations, though still not amazing. But the chassis, suspension, and braking are just horrible. It's overly harsh, the traction control has schizophrenia, running over a pebble mid-corner will unbalance the whole car, and the brakes were fading halfway through my test drive. Maybe the CCBs are better, but the chassis is still a deathtrap. Hard pass.
* ***Tesla Model 3 Performance:*** The best car you can buy right now if you're looking for a toaster to get you from A to B.

post,18v3s5e,,Investing in software companies (tin foil chat),"Wanted to share some thought on how to pick stocks in technology. I want to focus on the quality of revenue. I did t know this until I spoke with a few experts and got me thinking about fraud and if there is a method to spot fraud in technology consistently. 

I was brought up in the UK in the 90s and 00s where some managers made a fortune by investing in internet companies. Most of those people were long only investors and the horizon was super long. Their main thesis was around changes in society, habitual changes, that would have led to some internet companies to show abnormal growth in stock price. Amazon, Google, FB, Microsoft etc. These managers literally became millionaires. 

The legacy of these managers dies hard and there are many money managers betting on healthcare tech (bio tech), food industries or energy transition. Their bets are almost always driven by top down analysis, instead of understanding the operations of each company. Most of these firms generate their money from licensing. 

Licensing revenue has distinct characteristics such as
- multi year firm wide contract 
- cost of switching tends to be expensive 
- once signed, your revenue is basically guaranteed for a good few years 

One often overlooked is the fact that companies have a great leeway on when to book/show sales and cancellations in their book if and when these multi year licensing contracts get cancelled.

Imagine a hypothetical scenario where a firm sells a licensing agreement. The customer gives a notice or intent to cancel this licensing agreement at the end of the term or even in the middle of it for whatever reasons.  
- there is often penalty involved in early termination 
- the notice period is longer often in months

How does this cancellation appear in your quarterly or semi annual reports?

For this potential loss to appear in the official report, you would need this cancellation to be passed to a relevant department and recorded.",3910,True,1704013141.0,2023-12-31 09:59:01,1,0,Late-Ad-9930,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18v3s5e/investing_in_software_companies_tin_foil_chat/,True,0.56,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1adgztd,,Tesla's Bull Case,"I see a lot of negative sentiment around Tesla and a true lack of understanding of what is to come.

I have been in Tesla since 2017 and this company has evolved in ways I never imagined.

I am more bullish today than I have ever been.

This is not investment advice and I honestly don't care whether you buy, sell, short, use options or anything else.

&#x200B;

People see Tesla's market cap of approximately $575 billion and immediately think it's overvalued.  They only make X amount, they only sold X amount, and Elon said/did this today.

&#x200B;

If it were as easy as looking at what a company currently is, or what they have done, everyone would be rich.  That is not how investing works.  There needs to be an understanding of what the future will look like.

&#x200B;

The future I see is one of abundance of labor, energy, time, etc.

&#x200B;

Tesla is set up to capitalize like no other company in history and become larger than anything anyone has ever built before.

&#x200B;

Lets focus on the now for a moment though.

&#x200B;

Things to understand, the company has the #1 selling vehicle in the world.  Not just #1 EV, it's the #1 car.

The TAM for there current lineup of vehicles is approaching it's cap with current interest rates and pricing.  The growth will be moderate compared to what people are use too from Tesla.

The current lineup of vehicles is printing money for them though, which is padding there balance sheet now with $29 billion in cash, about 5% of the market cap and the rest covering all of their current investments in the future and operations.

So for 2024 we can expect moderate volume growth and everyone already knows.

What will margins look like in 2024, nobody really knows, some people think it will continue to trend down, some people think it bottomed in Q3, when it bounced up slightly in Q4. Regardless I know that they will be printing more money and strengthening their balance sheet further while growing current projects.",5955,True,1706485835.0,2024-01-29 00:50:35,0,154,PricedIn18,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1adgztd/teslas_bull_case/,True,0.46,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1bhuhzh,,Lemon-Musk interview: Musk teases Tesla flying cars w/ SpaceX. Stock is up 6%. Are flying cars baked in the stock price?,"""*Billionaire Elon Musk has teased the possibility of producing a commercially-available flying car as the next generation of Tesla vehicles.*

*In an interview with journalist Don Lemon released in full on Monday morning, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO was asked about the new model of the Roadster—the car manufacturer's original design—which is due to be released next year. ""Look, I don't want to give away much more than what I've said publicly, except that the Roadster will be a collaboration between SpaceX and Tesla—so you can expect some rocket-y stuff there,"" he said.*  
*Asked by Lemon if it could be a flying car, Musk responded: ""Maybe,"" before waggling his head and laughing. ""It's not out of the question. I've got to reserve the cool stuff for when we actually unveil it, but it's going to be really cool; it's going to have some rocket technology in it.""*

*He added: ""I think, really, the only way to do something that's cooler than the Cybertruck is to combine SpaceX and Tesla technology to create something that's not ever really a car.""*

*""Then what would it be?"" Lemon asked.*

*""Something that's never existed before,"" Musk said, before agreeing with Lemon that it would have ""Jetsons vibes,"" a reference to the space age Hanna-Barbera cartoon which features flying cars.*

***The Context***:

*Tesla would not be the first company to attempt to build a commercially viable flying car. Several start-ups have been making use of advances in electric vehicle technology in recent years to design vehicles that hope to live up to science fiction.*

*Most recently, San Mateo, California-based start-up Alef previously told Newsweek its prototype—which received Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) approval for testing last year, and operates using a hollow body and internal rotors—was in the works. The company said pre-orders for the $300,000 vehicle had surged since the start of 2023.",3290,True,1710778205.0,2024-03-18 17:10:05,376,380,LackingStory,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bhuhzh/lemonmusk_interview_musk_teases_tesla_flying_cars/,True,0.75,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1bpy94c,,Xiaomi releases electric car $4K cheaper than Tesla's Model 3 as price wars heat up,"Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi said Thursday it will sell its first car for far less than Tesla’s Model 3, as price wars heat up in China’s fiercely competitive electric car market.

Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said the standard version of the SU7 will sell for 215,900 yuan ($30,408) in the country — a price he acknowledged would mean the company was selling each car at a loss.

Tesla’s Model 3 starts at 245,900 yuan in China.

Lei claimed the standard version of the SU7 beat the Model 3 on more than 90% of its specifications, except on two aspects that he said it might take Xiaomi at least three to five years to catch up with Tesla on. He also said the SU7 had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus the Model 3′s 606 kilometers. The company said orders had exceeded 50,000 cars in the 27 minutes since sales started at 10 p.m. Beijing time Thursday.

Deliveries are set to start by the end of April, Lei said. Lei also claimed that Xiaomi’s car factory, for which all “key” steps are fully automated, can produce an SU7 every 76 seconds. It was not immediately clear whether the factory was fully operational.

Earlier this week, the Xiaomi CEO said on social media the SU7 would be the best sedan “under 500,000 yuan” ($69,328).

The car is entering a fiercely competitive market in China, where companies are launching a slew of new models and cutting prices in order to survive. Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has partnered with traditional automakers, most notably launching the Aito brand whose vehicles are often on display in Huawei smartphone showrooms.

Tesla’s Model 3 is the best-selling new energy sedan in China that has a driving range of at least 600 kilometers (372 miles) and costs less than 500,000 yuan, according to data from industry website Autohome.

BYD’s Han sedan starts at 169,800 yuan, according to Autohome.

Nio’s ET5 starts at 298,000 yuan, while Xpeng’s P7 starts at 209,900 yuan, the data showed.",4331,True,1711639443.0,2024-03-28 16:24:03,892,309,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bpy94c/xiaomi_releases_electric_car_4k_cheaper_than/,True,0.92,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1bwtyff,,Elon Musk says Tesla will unveil its robotaxi on Aug. 8; shares pop,"Tesla will reveal its robotaxi product on Aug. 8, CEO Elon Musk said in a social media post on X.

Musk has spoken about the robotaxi project for years, and it could represent a major new business for the carmaker as investors grow wary of the company during a period of slowing growth.

Tesla shares rose over 3% in extended trading after Musk’s tweet.

Musk shared the release date on Friday after Reuters reported that plans for Tesla’s highly anticipated low-cost car model had been scrapped. Musk accused Reuters of “lying.”

Tesla’s robotaxi project, according to Musk’s past remarks, would allow Tesla vehicles to use self-driving technology to autonomously pick up riders for fares. In 2019, Musk said that he expected to have over 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020. Author Walter Isaacson also mentioned the robotaxi project in his biography of Musk, published in 2022.

Currently, Tesla offers advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS,) including its Autopilot option, as well as a premium Full Self-Driving “FSD” option, which costs $199 per month for subscribers. However, Teslas currently cannot operate without human intervention.

There is significant competition in the market for taxi services that use self-driving cars.

Alphabet’s autonomous vehicle unit Waymo operates driverless ride-hailing services in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and is now ramping up in Tesla’s home base of Austin, Texas.

GM’s Cruise service previously offered self-driving car services in San Francisco before being wound down under regulatory scrutiny after an accident. Since the incident, Cruise’s robotaxi fleet has been grounded, local and federal governments have launched their own investigations and Cruise leadership has been gutted.

post,1c9qktm,,"Tesla cuts prices nearly $2,000 in China, in line with U.S. cuts","Tesla has cut prices by nearly $2,000 across its models in China, after price cuts in the United States, as it grapples with falling sales and an intensifying price war for electric vehicles (EVs), especially against cheaper Chinese EVs.

Elon Musk’s EV maker cut the starting price of the revamped Model 3 in China by 14,000 yuan ($1,930) to 231,900 yuan, its official website showed on Sunday.

Tesla made similar cuts to the Model Y starting price, now 249,900 yuan, the regular version of the Model S to 684,900 yuan and the Model S Plaid to 814,900 yuan. The regular Model X now costs 724,900 yuan and its plaid variant 824,900 yuan.

The carmaker on Friday cut U.S. prices of its Model Y, Model X and Model S vehicles by $2,000. On Saturday it slashed the price of its Full Self-Driving driver assistant software to $8,000 from $12,000 in the United States.

Tesla reported this month that its global vehicle deliveries in the first quarter fell for the first time in nearly four years, as price cuts failed to stir demand.

The EV maker has been slow to refresh its ageing models as high interest rates have sapped consumer appetite for big-ticket items, while rivals in China, the world’s largest auto market, are rolling out cheaper models.

Musk postponed a planned trip this weekend to India, where he was to have met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, citing obligations at Tesla. The trip was to have included the announcement of plans for Tesla to enter the South Asian market, Reuters has reported on Saturday.

Musk said last Monday that Tesla will lay off more than 10% of its global workforce as the automaker is bracing for its first annual drop in deliveries.

The announcement came after Reuters reported on April 5 that Tesla had scrapped its plan to develop its long-awaited affordable EV in favour of robotaxis. Musk posted that “Reuters is lying” after the report, without citing any inaccuracies.",2252,True,1713728258.0,2024-04-21 21:37:38,636,186,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1c9qktm/tesla_cuts_prices_nearly_2000_in_china_in_line/,True,0.94,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1cb4vkz,,Why Aren't More Businesses Managed Like Publix Supermarkets?,"Please be kind, I'm making this post to find understanding and gain perspective. Thank you.

If you're not familiar, there is a grocery store chain in Florida. Publix Supermarkets. Even if you're not from the South, there is a chance you're familiar with the chain. It's known for its clean stores, exceptional service, brand recognition, and for treating its customers with dignity. The business is well over fifty years old. Many of their long-time employees, 20-30 years, have the status of ""Publix Millionaires."" This is due to the internal stock program within the company.

I'm curious as to why more companies don't use this model.  If a small supermarket chain can do it, why can't more companies (tech, financial firms, etc) do it? I'm not saying it's the best model, but why don't why celebrate companies like Publix, and encourage a culture that does this? To think that a little Southern supermarket has less turnover and more employee/customer/market trust than a billion-dollar company like Tesla makes me chuckle. Hell, Publix might last longer than Tesla!

At the same time, can someone enlighten me on what makes Publix a successful business from a  development perspective? Where is could improve? Honestly, I only have a general (mostly lament) understanding of business development.

post,1cc3dtf,,INTC vs TSLA - Trying to understand market sentiment.,"Forgive my naive question but I'm really trying to wrap my head around these two stocks (stockholder in both).  
  
INTC - Semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse. Still has a majority in data center and pc CPU space. I do agree that they fell behind TSMC and Samsung in terms of process leadership and don't have a serious product offering in the GPU space that can take on Nvidia H100 (Gaudi 3 seems like a good competitor). And Pat Gelsinger is trying hard to bring it back on track. They have 18A process node on track to hit HVM production in 2025(?), US government is funding their fab expansion plans, Foundry is slowly winning customer, and for the next few years, compute is the new oil. Everything seems to be inline for INTC to go up like AMD and NVDA. But no, it always drops.  
  
TSLA - Eccentric owner who is more interested in peddling conspiracy theories on X that he bought on a whim. FSD was a long lost pipe dream, which never seems to be working fine , and current version has its own kinks. EV is becoming an extremely competitive market everyday with new entrants and an ongoing price war. Cybertruck was late by 2-3(?) years and has. IDK if Roadster will ever happen in this decade, Tesla Semi is another thing which seemed nice on paper but idk if it's ever really gonna happen. News reports claimed that Musk cancelled Model2. But again claims TSLA is gonna make a cheaper model ( which would probably cannibalize Model 3 and Model Y sales; and lets be honest - no one knows if and when that's actually coming on the roads).

post,1ce2p7z,,Tesla Autopilot has 'critical safety gap' linked to hundreds of collisions: NHTSA,"Federal authorities say a “critical safety gap” in Tesla’s Autopilot system contributed to at least 467 collisions, 13 resulting in fatalities and “many others” resulting in serious injuries.

The findings come from a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration analysis of 956 crashes in which Tesla Autopilot was thought to have been in use. The results of the nearly three-year investigation were published Friday.

Tesla’s Autopilot design has “led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes,” the NHTSA report said. The system did not “sufficiently ensure driver attention and appropriate use.”

NHTSA’s filing pointed to a “weak driver engagement system,” and Autopilot that stays switched on even when a driver isn’t paying adequate attention to the road or the driving task. The driver engagement system includes various prompts, including “nags” or chimes, that tell drivers to pay attention and keep their hands on the wheel, as well as in-cabin cameras that can detect when a driver is not looking at the road. 

The agency also said it was opening a new probe into the effectiveness of a software update Tesla previously issued as part of a recall in December. That update was meant to fix Autopilot defects that NHTSA identified as part of this same investigation.

The voluntary recall via an over-the-air software update covered 2 million Tesla vehicles in the U.S., and was supposed to specifically improve driver monitoring systems in Teslas equipped with Autopilot.

NHTSA suggested in its report Friday that the software update was probably inadequate, since more crashes linked to Autopilot continue to be reported.

In one recent example, a Tesla driver in Snohomish County, Washington, struck and killed a motorcyclist on April 19, according to records obtained by CNBC and NBC News. The driver told police he was using Autopilot at the time of the collision.",5049,True,1714182190.0,2024-04-27 03:43:10,441,154,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ce2p7z/tesla_autopilot_has_critical_safety_gap_linked_to/,True,0.84,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1cnicsr,,NIO's Strategic Charge in the Global EV Market,"Investing in NIO, despite its current operational losses and significant debt levels, can be considered a forward-looking strategy, particularly for those who are bullish on the future of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable technologies. 

NIO's debt is largely a reflection of its aggressive investment in research and development, infrastructure, and expanding production capabilities. These investments are critical for gaining a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving EV market. By financing growth and innovation, NIO is positioning itself to capture a significant share of the global EV market, which is expected to grow substantially.  NIO is not just focusing on the Chinese market but is also eyeing expansion into Europe and potentially other international markets, giving it more growth opportunities.

The automotive industry is undergoing a significant transformation, moving away from fossil fuels to electric and hybrid vehicles. This shift is expected to continue due to the decreasing cost of batteries, improved EV infrastructure, and increasing societal awareness about climate change.

However the journey to other countries such as America does not come without challenges, especially with the  giant EV manufacturer Tesla running the show. Tesla has a strong brand presence in the U.S., recognized for pioneering the electric car industry and backed by high-profile CEO Elon Musk. Tesla's brand is associated with innovation, quality, and sustainability, aspects that resonate well with American consumers. NIO, while a recognized brand in China and some parts of Europe, would need marketing efforts to establish similar recognition in the U.S.  For NIO to compete effectively, it will need to differentiate its vehicles through unique features, possibly focusing on its innovative Battery as a Service (BaaS) model, advanced autonomous driving capabilities, and superior interior luxury, which are some of NIO's strong suits.",3003,True,1715209810.0,2024-05-09 01:10:10,0,1,YoungChopOnDaBeat,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1cnicsr/nios_strategic_charge_in_the_global_ev_market/,True,0.44,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1cvelzm,,"As Tesla layoffs continue, here are 600 jobs the company cut in California ","As part of Tesla’s massive restructuring, the electric-vehicle maker notified the California Employment Development Department this week that it’s cutting approximately 600 more employees at its manufacturing facilities and engineering offices between Fremont and Palo Alto.

The latest round of layoffs eliminated roles across the board — from entry-level positions to directors — and hit an array of departments, impacting factory workers, software developers and robotics engineers.

The cuts were reported in a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, Act filing that CNBC obtained through a public records request.

Facing both weakening demand for Tesla electric vehicles and increased competition, the company has been slashing its headcount since at least January. CEO Elon Musk told employees in a memo in April that the company would cut more than 10% of its global workforce, which totaled 140,473 employees at the end of 2023.

Previous filings revealed that Tesla would cut more than 6,300 jobs across California; Austin, Texas; and Buffalo, New York.

Musk said on Tesla’s quarterly earnings call on April 23 that the company had built up a 25% to 30% “inefficiency” over the past several years, implying the layoffs underway could impact tens of thousands more employees than the 10% number would suggest.

According to the WARN filing, the 378 job cuts in Fremont, home to Tesla’s first U.S. manufacturing plant, included people involved in staffing and running vehicle assembly. There were 65 cuts at the company’s Kato Rd. battery development center.

Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Among the highest-level roles eliminated in Fremont were two environmental health and safety directors, and a user experience design director.

post,1d7wmef,,Elon Musk ordered Nvidia to ship AI chips reserved for Tesla to X and xAI ,"Elon Musk claims he can grow Tesla into “a leader in AI & robotics,” an ambition that he’s said will require a lot of pricey processors from Nvidia to build up its infrastructure.

On Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call in April, Musk said the electric vehicle company will increase the number of active H100s — Nvidia’s flagship artificial intelligence chip — from 35,000 to 85,000 by the end of this year. He also wrote in a post on X a few days later that Tesla would spend $10 billion this year “in combined training and inference AI.”

But emails written by Nvidia senior staff and widely shared inside the company suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla’s procurement to shareholders. Correspondence from Nvidia staffers also indicates that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter.

By ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla, Musk pushed back the automaker’s receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.

“Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,” an Nvidia memo from December said. “In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.”

A more recent Nvidia email, from late April, said Musk’s comment on the first-quarter Tesla call “conflicts with bookings” and that his April post on X about $10 billion in AI spending also “conflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts.” The email referenced news about Tesla’s ongoing, drastic layoffs and warned that headcount reductions could cause further delays with an “H100 project” at Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory.",10038,True,1717506180.0,2024-06-04 15:03:00,576,219,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1d7wmef/elon_musk_ordered_nvidia_to_ship_ai_chips/,True,0.91,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

I have more than 10x those shares held in a Roth IRA brokerage account, and still can’t figure out how to vote those, either. This annoyed  me at first, but after thinking about it, I just voted the way the board voted anyway so what was the point of even voting?   It seems to makes little sense for me to spend an hour trying to sort this out, when I’m voting with the board anyway.

Why did Tesla run a vote your shares drawing, when NOT voting would actually allow those shares to vote with the board?

I go into account, no card attached, so I add same card, multiple times, no go.  I add an AmEx, nope, Visa, Nope.  I call Discover and they say the charge actually went through (precise amount, not even a pre-allocation).

post,1dfg8h3,,Musk says robots could make Tesla $25 trillion company — more than half value of S&P 500 ,"The entire value of the S&P 500 currently stands at $45.5 trillion, according to FactSet. Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed on Thursday that his company’s Optimus humanoid robots could eventually make the automaker worth more than half of that.

Musk, who characterized himself as “pathologically optimistic” at the 2024 annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas, said Tesla is embarking on not just a “new chapter” in its life, but is about to write an entirely “new book.” Optimus appears to be one of the main characters.

Tesla first revealed its plans to work on humanoid robots in 2021 at an AI Day event, trotting out a dancer in a unitard that looked like a sleek, androgynous robot.

In January, Tesla showed off Optimus robots folding laundry in a demo video that was immediately criticized by robotics engineers for being deceptive. The robots were not autonomous, but were rather being operated with humans at the controls.

At the shareholder event on Thursday, Musk didn’t divulge exactly what Optimus can do today. He suggested the robots some day will perform like R2-D2 and C-3PO in Star Wars. They could cook or clean for you, do factory work, or even teach your children, Musk suggested.

As for shareholder value, Musk said Optimus could be the catalyst for lifting Tesla’s market cap to $25 trillion someday.

Speaking to a crowd consisting mostly of fawning fanboys in an auditorium at the Gigafactory, Musk promised Tesla would move into “limited production” of Optimus in 2025 and test out humanoid robots in its own factories next year.

The company, he predicted, will have “over 1,000, or a few thousand, Optimus robots working at Tesla” in 2025.

This is all far-out stuff even for Musk, who is notorious for making ambitious promises to investors and customers that don’t pan out — from developing software that can turn an existing Tesla into a self-driving vehicle with an upload, to EV battery swapping stations.",4924,True,1718331774.0,2024-06-14 04:22:54,533,451,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dfg8h3/musk_says_robots_could_make_tesla_25_trillion/,True,0.73,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1dk68we,,Dell and Partners Join Forces to Build AI Factory for Elon Musk's xAI,"Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer are collaborating to provide server racks for a supercomputer being developed by Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI. This supercomputer will power the next version of xAI's generative AI chatbot, Grok, and is expected to be operational by fall 2025.

# Key Takeaways

* Dell and Super Micro Computer are providing server racks for xAI's supercomputer.
* The supercomputer will power the next version of xAI's AI chatbot, Grok.
* The project is expected to be completed by fall 2025.
* The collaboration involves Nvidia's advanced AI GPUs.

# Dell and Super Micro's Role

Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer are key players in the development of xAI's supercomputer. Dell is responsible for assembling half of the server racks, while Super Micro, known for its liquid-cooling technology and strong ties with chip firms like Nvidia, will handle the other half. This collaboration was confirmed by Elon Musk on the social media platform X.

# Nvidia's Contribution

Nvidia is providing the advanced AI GPUs required for the project. The training of AI models like Grok requires tens of thousands of power-hungry chips. For instance, training the Grok 2 model took about 20,000 Nvidia H100 graphic processing units (GPUs), and future models will require even more. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, emphasized the importance of this collaboration in expanding the reach of AI technology.

# The AI Factory

Dell CEO Michael Dell announced that the company is building an ""AI factory"" with Nvidia to power Grok. This AI factory will be a comprehensive infrastructure, including CPUs, GPUs, networking switches, software systems, and storage, all connected by miles of cables. The factory aims to make it easier for a broader range of customers to establish their own AI factories.

# Future Prospects

Elon Musk has ambitious plans for xAI.

post,1dsjrlp,,Replicate a hand-free trunk with iOS Shortcuts and NFC tags,"*With an iPhone, Apple’s Shortcuts app, and an NFC tag, you can make pretty much any Tesla have a hands-free\* trunk by following this guide.  Scroll to the end if you are already familiar with iOS Shortcuts and want the quick setup guide.*

My 2023 Long Range Model Y unfortunately does not work with Tesla’s recent hands-free trunk feature since the Model Y lacks the UWB hardware.  However, I replicated similar behavior (within a window of time), and wanted to share how in case someone else would find it useful.  The only downside is that you need to roughly estimate how long it will take you to walk to your Tesla.  The NFC tag on the Tesla is also pretty ugly, but at the same time helps you pick out your white Tesla among the 10 others in the parking lot haha.

\* This is hands-free once you've reached your Tesla within the chosen time window, but requires you to first manually run the shortcut. This can be useful if you know you are about to head to your Tesla with your hands full and don't already have access to Siri via an Apple Watch or AirPods.

https://reddit.com/link/1dsjrlp/video/jxi7vtlvvt9d1/player

**You will need:**

* An iPhone that supports background NFC reading (iPhone XR/XS and later)
* Apple’s [Shortcuts app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334)
* NFC tags - [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPJ5DDCQ)
* A Tesla that supports opening the trunk with the Tesla app and iOS Shortcuts
* A custom shortcut I created called [Hands Free Trunk](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/29f19ada5bc444059394c7c885b38c1a)

**Detailed Setup Guide:**

*If you are already familiar with iOS shortcuts, see my quick setup guide at the bottom.*

* Stick an NFC tag onto your Tesla at a height where the top of your iPhone lines up with the tag while in your pocket.  *Note: the NFC tags I listed do not work when placed on metal.  So you will need to place the tag on a section of the Tesla that is plastic, like the bumper.",8870,True,1719806241.0,2024-07-01 05:57:21,23,19,AlfredNoldo,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1dsjrlp/replicate_a_handfree_trunk_with_ios_shortcuts_and/,True,0.73,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1dtlvh3,,"Tesla reports 443,956 deliveries in second quarter, a 4.8% decrease from last year ","Tesla just posted its second-quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers for 2024.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q2 2024: 443,956 vehicles

Total production Q2 2024: 410,831 vehicles

Tesla’s numbers beat Wall Street estimates. Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439,000 in the three months ending June 30, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet Street Account. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter was down 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier.

Troy Teslike, an independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans, predicted deliveries of 423,000 for the quarter.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the electric vehicle maker. Tesla groups deliveries into two categories — Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and all other vehicles — but doesn’t report numbers for individual models or specific regions.

Tesla’s current lineup includes its popular Model Y crossover utility vehicles, Model 3 sedans and the new Cybertruck pickups, as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan.

In April, Tesla reported a drop of 8.5% in first-quarter deliveries to 386,810, the first annual decline since 2020. Weeks later the company reported 13% decline in year-over-year revenue for the quarter, “primarily due to lower average selling price.”

Sluggish sales were in part the result of temporary factory shut downs initiated in response to an alleged arson attack at Tesla’s factory in Germany, as well as shipping delays following Red Sea conflicts, Tesla said.

But the sales drop also correlated with Tesla’s aging lineup of vehicles, increased competition from other EV makers especially in China, and brand erosion that one recent survey attributed partly to CEO Elon Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.”

Tesla shares are down 16% in 2024 even after rallying 6% on Monday.

post,1dulktf,,Tesla Set for a New Bull Run as Deliveries Turn Around and Energy Storage Powers the AI Era,"Whenever investors are disappointed with Tesla, Elon Musk surprises short sellers with a big move. On Tuesday, Tesla posted stronger-than-expected Q2 deliveries, hinting at a turning point for weak demand, with an upside in Q3 deliveries. Additionally, energy storage deployments doubled quarter-over-quarter, potentially helping to meet the vast electricity demand that comes with AI. These factors are enough to bring in a substantial influx of Tesla bulls.

Thanks to these developments, Tesla surged over 10% on Tuesday, with its market value reaching $737.5 billion, maintaining a six-day rally, and breaking another resistance level, which is always a bullish sign. From April's low, Tesla shares are now up 67%.

**Q2 Deliveries Slightly Exceed Expectations Amid Record June Deliveries from Chinese EV Makers, Zero-Interest Car Purchases Expected to Drive Crazy Q3 Demand**

According to Tesla's delivery data released on Tuesday, the company delivered 440,000 new vehicles in Q2, down 4.8% year-over-year but up 15% quarter-over-quarter, and better than the market's expectation of 439,300 vehicles. The total production in Q2 was about 411,000 cars, resulting in a delivery-production gap of 33,000 cars, compared to -46,000 cars in the previous quarter (where more cars were produced, leading to some inventory remaining). Tesla noted that sales in the second quarter were affected by the temporary shutdown of German factories and the Red Sea conflict, which also means there is upward potential on the demand side or perhaps short-term supply struggles to meet demand, which is obviously more exciting than excess supply.

Considering that Chinese EV makers such as NIO, ZEEKR, and Leapmotor have all reported record deliveries in June, this implies a significant recovery in demand for Tesla.

post,1e16r7e,,My view on the language model value chain.,"Hi, I am a founder who is trying to build ""Google for Financial Research"" start out from equity research.

  
Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :)

  
### Value Chain



First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. 

- Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything.

- Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything.

- Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything.

  
### Past

  
Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. 

  
OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong.

  
### Present

  
Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies.

post,1egx51l,,Qualcomm beats estimates and phone chip sales are up 12% ,"Qualcomm reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations, particularly for sales, and provided strong guidance for the current quarter.

Qualcomm stock rose over 4% in extended trading.

Here’s how Qualcomm did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending in June 23:

Earnings per share: $2.33, adjusted versus $2.25 expected

Revenue: $9.39 billion, adjusted, versus $9.22 billion expected

Net income during the quarter was $2.13 billion, or $1.88 per share, versus $1.8 billion, or $1.60 per share in the year-ago period.

Qualcomm said it expected between $9.5 billion and $10.3 billion in sales in the current quarter, compared to Wall Street expectations of $9.71 billion. Analysts were looking for earnings guidance of $2.45, versus the company’s forecast of between $2.38 and $2.58.

Qualcomm’s biggest and most important business is processors and modems for smartphones, which it calls its handsets business. The summer months are traditionally a slower part of the annual cycle for smartphones, because most new models launch in the fall.

Handset sales rose 12% on a year-over-year basis to $5.9 billion in revenue, in line with analyst estimates from StreetAccount, which suggests that a deep slump in smartphone sales over the past two years is abating. Qualcomm is also framing its most advanced Snapdragon chips as necessary for “AI smartphones,” such as recent Samsung models, which can run some generative AI tasks like creating images.

Automotive chips remains small for Qualcomm but the company sees placing more software and semiconductors into cars as one of its strongest opportunities for growth and diversification. Automotive revenues rose 87% on an annual basis to $811 million. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were looking for $641.7 million.

The company sells chips for lower-cost devices as well as Meta’s Quest headsets in a business it calls “Internet of Things.",2938,True,1722456843.0,2024-07-31 22:14:03,179,31,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1egx51l/qualcomm_beats_estimates_and_phone_chip_sales_are/,True,0.98,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

* This Gravity SUV is expected to rival Tesla’s Model X SUV in the market, and is expected to enter production in late 2024.

Here is some info about the Lucid Gravity SUV:

Awesome looking Lucid Gravity SUV with estimated range of 440 miles and ""under $80,000""

The gravity uses ""the next generation of Lucid's proprietary, ultra-compact powertrain technology"".

Fast charging speeds with the 900-volt architecture likely as high as the Air's 300kW.

0 to 60mph in less than 3.5 seconds.

440 miles estimated range is over 100 mile more than Tesla's longest range Model X.

Clamshell design hatch with practically identical roofline like the Air's

Incredibly aerodynamic with drag coefficient of 0.24

Lots of interior space with three rows for seven-passenger.

Improved interface with a 34-inch curved display and a large secondary screen below.

Expect to be on sale by late 2024.

post,1f1ozpe,,"Canada EV Tariffs, will this impact Canadian Tesla prices/incentives? ","There may be a paywall for this article so please find it here:

Canada will impose new tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, aluminum and steel, lining up behind western allies and taking steps to protect domestic manufacturers.
The government plans to announce a 100% levy on electric cars and 25% on steel and aluminum, according to people familiar with the matter, speaking on condition they not be identified because the matter is still private. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to unveil the policy in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he’s gathered with the rest of his cabinet for a series of meetings about the economy and foreign relations.
Canada, an export-driven economy that relies heavily on trade with the US, has been closely watching moves by the Biden administration to erect a much higher tariff wall against Chinese EVs, batteries, solar cells, steel and other products. Canada’s auto sector is heavily integrated with that of its closest neighbor: The vast majority of its light vehicle production — which was 1.5 million units last year — is exported to the US.
Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, the most powerful person in Trudeau’s cabinet, has been one of the most prominent voices in favor of a harder approach to Chinese vehicle exports, and becoming a closer trade ally with the US.

post,1f7513x,,BYD sales hit a record in August despite broader China EV slowdown ,"Chinese electric car giant BYD sold a record number of passenger vehicles in August, with sales of hybrids growing faster than those of battery-only cars.

The company said August sales rose by 30% year-on-year to 370,854 passenger cars.

Its sales of battery-only cars rose by nearly 12%, while hybrid-powered vehicle sales surged by 48% to account for just under two-thirds of BYD cars sold last month.

In contrast, several new energy vehicle startups saw a dip in deliveries last month.

Li Auto, best known for its range-extender vehicles, reported 48,122 deliveries in August, down from a record 51,000 in July.

Aito, which uses Huawei technology, said it delivered 31,216 cars last month, down by more than 10,000 vehicles from the prior month. Huawei is selling the Aito trademark and patents to automaker Seres for 2.5 billion yuan ($352.5 million).

Lower-priced cars hitting the market

Nio said it delivered 20,176 cars in August, down slightly from July but above 20,000 for a fourth-straight month.

The company’s lower-priced brand Onvo opened 105 stores on Sunday as it prepares to begin for deliveries for its first car, the L60 SUV, this month. Nio is scheduled to report earnings on Friday.

Xpeng reported 14,036 car deliveries in August, its best month for the year so far.

The company said on Friday it began some deliveries of its newly launched, mass market Mona M03 electric car that sells for the equivalent of less than $20,000 in China. It was not clear whether those M03 deliveries were included in the total figure Xpeng reported.

Geely-backed Zeekr reported a month-on-month increase to 18,015 deliveries in August, but that was down from 20,206 deliveries in June.

post,1f785wr,,Thoughts on skill-based hiring,"What’s your take on the latest hiring trend that’s picking up steam with companies like Google, IBM, Tesla, and even the White House?  

I’ve got mixed feelings. On one hand, dropping the degree requirement opens the talent pool, which is great for filling skill gaps fast. But there are some concerns. Passing a technical test doesn’t always mean someone is ready to handle the complexities of managing digital infrastructure or securing user data. 

We should take a moment to think about what a degree actually represents. It’s not just about having technical skills; it also shows that someone can commit to long-term goals, tackle complex tasks, work well in teams, and bring critical thinking, problem-solving, and leadership skills to the table. 

Skill-based hiring might be a great fit for entry-level roles or hands-on jobs, but for more complex projects, I think it’s still important to consider academic background. A balanced approach seems ideal—one that combines technical assessments with evaluations of soft skills and how someone might perform under pressure in real-world situations. 

What do you all think?

post,1fcyze8,,How To Get Money For A Business,"I've seen a lot of posts about people wanting money to start or grow a business but not knowing how.

These are some of the easiest ways to get money to start a business:

1. **Presales.** Preselling subscriptions or even physical products will allow you to fund your business for $0 upfront. Tesla used presales on the Cybertruck to get a free $25 million dollar loan from their customers. You can do the same thing on a smaller scale.
2. **Business credit.** If you have a 700 credit score and an LLC that's at least 3 months old, you can $100k+ in business credit. Right now there are certain credit products that literally offer 0% interest for the first 12-18 months. 
3. **Friends and family.** If you truly have a compelling idea, raising money from friends and family is a viable option most people are afraid of. This one does come with some drawbacks (especially if you fail) but it can also provide strong motivation not to fail
4. **SBA loans.** These can be a little tough to get and typically take at least 3 months to close, but they can have incredibly good interest rates if you get approved.
5. **Seller finance.** If you're buying an existing business, many businesses will offer some form of seller finance simply to get the deal done. 
6. **Crowdfunding.** Using crowdfunding platforms can be a great way to fund a new business or get money for an existing business without the direct pressure of asking friends and family. It does require some marketing skills to get any real traction though. 
7. **Venture Capital / Angel Investors.** There are several platforms that will allow you to raise money through VC or angel investors. 

There are plenty of reasons not to start or grow a business but don't let lack of funding be one of them. 

Many businesses struggle or fail simply because the business owners don't know there are so many options out there.

post,1fqk8k6,,'Safety Disaster:' Tesla FSD 'Galaxies Away From Being Anywhere Close To Competition',"* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.
* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.

  
With just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company’s self-driving technology.



**What Happened**: Tesla’s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a “safety disaster” and “galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,” said GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla’s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.’s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.’s GM Cruise.



With Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.’s BIDU Apollo Go.



Johnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla’s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is “suspect.” In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. “In fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,” it said.



While the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. “The most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,” it added.



Johnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.",3338,True,1727431479.0,2024-09-27 12:04:39,264,176,NeighborhoodOld7075,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fqk8k6/safety_disaster_tesla_fsd_galaxies_away_from/,True,0.79,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress","Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla’s Cybercab concept vehicle — a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals — on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have “unsupervised FSD” up and running in Texas and California next year in the company’s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla’s premium driver assistance system, available today in a “supervised” version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

“As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

“Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.",3313,True,1728649167.0,2024-10-11 14:19:27,1702,563,thelastsubject123,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g18fon/tesla_shares_drop_6_in_premarket_after_cybercab/,True,0.93,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1g1e9q0,,Tesla is Completely out of Touch with Needs of Taxi Services. ,"Seeing a lot of focus on the Temu Boston Dynamics bot, but not a lot of discussion on the robo taxi. 

How this thing is built tells me how out of touch and unprepared Tesla is to seriously compete in ride servicing. 

First off this thing has two seats, that alone is such a dumb design decision. It had to be Elon that said to keep it as two seats so it looks futuristic and aesthetic. What if I want to travel with a small group of people? I’m not using the LAX shuttle van at that point, I’m immediately turning to a competitor. Haven’t really seen anyone comment on how out of touch and unnecessary that was. 

One other concern I have is how Tesla primarily uses cameras. What if there are sirens and a fire truck, ambulance, or police car is blowing through an intersection. Other autonomous vehicles incorporate sound, I’m not too sure Tesla does. If not it sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. 

Beyond this there’s the ridiculous price tag he put on it which it’ll probably be nowhere close to. 

What are other people’s thoughts on this, did anything with this Robotaxi actually look like a feasible product to you? It looks like an aesthetic toy, but not an actual product that can compete in the space. Based on my understanding of a typical car design cycle, redesigning this to add four instead of just 2 seats would take probably another 2-4 years at least. To me it seems like they really just showed they lost on their biggest bet in the near future. 


Edit: Alright read through the comments, and still think the 2 seat no steering wheel design is stupid. People are saying this is meant to also be a personal commuter car. So my choices are to buy a 30K Robotaxi (knowing Tesla’s history this WILL be priced higher) and then ALSO get a model 3 or model Y to drive around my family for ANOTHER 40K when I can just get ONE model 3 or any other self driving car, no Robotaxi and do everything I need?",3228,True,1728665139.0,2024-10-11 18:45:39,774,430,YungPersian,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g1e9q0/tesla_is_completely_out_of_touch_with_needs_of/,True,0.8,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1g4cmvs,,"""frontier tech"" portfolio ","hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things:

* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.
* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.

post,1g8jv19,,EV Rental in Spain  1X1 BMW,"Rented a mid-level BMW 1X1 in Barcelona Spain for two days for drive to small town 150km away.

The cars range is about 250 miles at 100% derating the WLPT rating to EPA.  Still hot in Spain so AC all the way.

The IX1 is a great car.  It had heads up display.  Its great when integrated with NAV and cruise control and has  become a must have feature.  Quiet, comfortable.   Regular car acceleration but that will help with range.

Charging in Spain turned out to be excellent.  Every large gas station had a couple chargers.    Typically just 50kW.  Might take extra time but that's about it.   Availability is all important. Even at 6AM I was able to get one to work from scratch, using the QR to get the app and using that for topping off for the trip after using the car the previous day.   That was the only time I needed on the road fast charging.  The town had two free L2 charges and plugged into one for the day. The Tesla S on the other charger was there when I got there and there when I left five hours later.

Parking garage in center of Barcelona had 20 chargers.  8 were just for Sixt, the car rental company, the others for the public.  When we were in the garage, always some public chargers available.  Parking garage for the car two blocks from our apartment had 2 x L2 which we used two nights.  That was super convenient having 100% charge.

Tesla chargers were available but we never got to try them out.  I have a Model 3 so ""Add your EV"" in the Tesla app was easy and it hten provide directions, maps, availability to use them.

The BMW nav app had a ""Go to charger feature"" which was good. It also had a nice feature of ""Start Preconditioning"" so could turn that on so you could charge faster.

Overall, renting an EV in Spain was easy with enough chargers to quell any range anxiety.",1810,False,1729494780.0,2024-10-21 09:13:00,8,3,EaglesPDX,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1g8jv19/ev_rental_in_spain_1x1_bmw/,True,0.9,2024,both,search,False,False,0,
post,1gak7c4,,Tesla shares jump 6% on profit beat,"* Tesla reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts’ estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected

Revenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.

Tesla’s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.

Automotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.

Operating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.

Tesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023.

post,1gbcgse,,Tesla stock has best day in over a decade on Musk's 2025 growth projection,"Tesla shares soared 22% to close at $260.48 on Thursday, the stock’s best day since 2013, following the company’s better-than-expected earnings report.

The company late Wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which came in just under analysts’ expectations of $25.37 billion, but was up 8% compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.

“We expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in Tesla shares Thursday, given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note.

Tesla’s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a “potentially unsustainable driver” of earnings and cash flow.

Automakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year, and if they can’t meet the target, they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles.

Tesla earnings also got a boost from FSD, the company’s Full Self-Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called “Actually Smart Summon.”

CEO Elon Musk said on the call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.

Even bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk’s forecast and wrote, in a note following the earnings report, “Our view remains more reserved at 10-15% (~2.03m),” and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30,000 after subsidies, and other variants of the small SUV.",4112,True,1729801558.0,2024-10-24 22:25:58,558,381,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gbcgse/tesla_stock_has_best_day_in_over_a_decade_on/,True,0.8,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1gdaymy,,Is Geely EX5 the new Atto 3?,"The Geely E5 will be launched globally end of this year as Geely EX5 and as Proton e.Mas 7 in Malaysia.

On paper it is in many aspects a better car than the popular BYD Atto 3 for the same price in China:

\- dimensions and interior/boot space  
\- motor performance & torque  
\- efficiency of \~ 12 kw/100km in ideal circumstances  
\- better ride and dynamic handling  
\- better infotainment system  
\- most importantly a better LFP [battery](https://carnewschina.com/2024/06/28/geelys-aegis-short-blade-lfp-battery-full-details-including-extreme-safety/) than BYD Gen 1 blade battery. It has a higher energy density, more charge cycles, faster charging, and with more [extensive](https://youtu.be/Xme91gRHV24?si=x9wcZ6qGe1714wW_) safety tests.

Do you expect it to be a hit like the Atto 3?

In China Geely's cars never made it to the top 10 of best selling cars like several of BYD EV's, including the Atto 3. On the other hand the E5 is right now at no 10 on the list of [hot cars](https://www.dongchedi.com/sales/hot-energy_1-x-x-x-x), while Atto 3 \[Yuan Plus\] is at no 14.

post,1gh1z43,,Need help regarding intrinsic value ,"So the stock in question is Tesla.

I have done lots of research into the company and it’s finances and have used multiple methods in order to determine an intrinsic value (including margin of safety) to find a nice entry price. The methods I have used are:

1) Discounted cash flow ($50.49)
2) Multiples valuation model ($31.81)
3) Graham’s valuation model ($179.41)

This is not to say that my valuations are correct by any means, and I accept there could be faults in my calculations. My concern is that Grahams valuation model has produced the highest IV by some margin. However, it seems quite reasonable given how Tesla stock has traded over the last few years that this could be fairly accurate. I just want some advice on how people would use these numbers. Would you:

A- Use grahams alone as a benchmark for IV

B- Try and find an average between all 3 models and use that as an IV value ($81 would be the average), but at the risk that the stock may never drop as low as this so I may miss out on the stock altogether 

Edit- Please offer your advice, I am trying my best to learn and would be handy to see what other people do in this situation ",1157,False,1730455784.0,2024-11-01 11:09:44,0,9,mindhunter11010,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gh1z43/need_help_regarding_intrinsic_value/,True,0.33,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Boeing stands as one of the most important players in the aerospace industry, with a heavily established brand and legacy that commands trust around the world. Despite recent operational and financial challenges affecting its stock price, Boeing’s intrinsic value and reputation position it as a viable investment. While relatively short-term setbacks have impacted shareholder sentiment, these issues are likely irrelevant in terms of Boeing’s long-term prospects as a leader in aviation. For a company of Boeing’s stature, resilience and success are inevitable, making it a viable investment opportunity amidst doubt in the markets.

**Boeing’s Brand Strength and Market Perception**

Since its founding in 1916, Boeing has had a long-standing reputation for safety and reliability. The company has bolstered its reputation through engineering marvels like the Boeing 747. Although Boeing has recently had many notable incidents, they have focused on being transparent and open with its shareholders. For example, production issues with the 787 Dreamliner, delays in the 777X program, software glitches affecting 737 MAX deliveries, supply chain disruptions, and quality control concerns have been openly handled by the company as they have been in direct communication with the National Transportation Safety Board in order to improve and learn from their mistakes. Another key factor is brand loyalty. Boeing’s brand strength is comparable to companies such as Coca-Cola and Apple. This loyalty and strength has been based on customer trust, market stability, innovation, and collaboration. Ultimately, Boeing’s long-standing reputation allows it to build strong brand loyalty, further bolstering its position in the aerospace industry and ensuring its continued relevance and resilience in the market.

post,1gukbnc,,"Test drove a few EVs, and here are my very brief takeaways","My model Y lease is ending and I won’t be getting another one. Over the past few days I test drove the following in hopes of finding a replacement:

1. Bmw IX x drive50 - felt plenty powerful even with the base motor. Rear seat had good room. However the front seat wasn’t that comfortable given the price point, and the interior felt impressive at first, until I stepped inside the Mercedes. The ride quality, handling, sound insulation and sound system were sublime. The cargo space was surprisingly small for such a large vehicle. 

2. Mercedes EQE SUV 350 - felt downright slow compared to the IX, but more than adequate for most daily drives. Like the IX, the trunk looked smaller than the compact model Y. The exterior styling resembled a blob with a Mercedes logo. But the interior was truly a showstopper even without the hyper screen. The seats felt the most comfortable and thickly padded out of the cars I tested. 

3. Tesla Model X - terrifyingly quick, and has the familiar tesla UI. It’s also the most useful for my particular needs, which is occasional use of the third row, supercharger access for longer trips, and larger cargo area relative to the Mercedes and bmw. Honestly, the interior isn’t as bad as people say, sure it doesn’t have the ambient lighting and design details of the Germans, but it’s still a tangible upgrade over the model Y. But I didn’t care for the haptic turn signals on the steering wheel and shifting through the touchscreen as well. Ride quality is good even with the 22 inch wheels.

4. Rivian R1S dual motor - this one was the biggest surprise. Despite the positive reviews I read online, the R1S was clearly my least favorite out of this group. It had the worst ride quality regardless of which suspension setting I used, even thought I tempered my expectations since this is an off road capable vehicle.",2290,True,1731976321.0,2024-11-19 01:32:01,189,354,Crazy_Day5359,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1gukbnc/test_drove_a_few_evs_and_here_are_my_very_brief/,True,0.77,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Like I said in comments; I do strongly encourage you to your own tests! What I like might not be what you like, what I hate might be what you love, etc

If I didn't post it, it wasn't in the running. Maybe I'll waste a salesman's time if people really want to hear my thoughts (although I don't know why you would) on something like the Q6 or Model X, but for now, I think I got basically everything for sale. Or something that I'd consider; sorry EV9, I just don't need a 3 row right now! Then again, my wife's family is notorious for twins, so hopefully I didn't jinx myself

FINAL SUBJECTIVE TOP 5:

1: BMW iX

2: Volvo EX30

3: BMW i4

4: Ford Mustang Mach-e

5: Hyundai Ioniq 6

*REVIEWS START HERE:*

1: Kia EV6: 9.5/10

This could basically be a copy of my Ioniq 5 review; fun to drive, all the benefits of that 800v charging, but it fixed two of my issues:

First: The massive, ridiculous bezels around the display are black, so you don't really notice them

Second: I can comfortably set the steering wheel to not obscure my view of the dash. I'm not sure, maybe this is a trim thing, but that was annoying in the Ioniq 5

Otherwise, my main issue with the EV6 is that its priced more with equivalent options compared to the Ioniq 5, and I'm really not sure why. To have feature parity with the stuff that most people want, you'll be shilling out \~$4000 more, and when it's loaded (but not GT/N) it's around $3000.

Given the fact that we went from a 4 year wait to them being stacked on lots in about a summer, I think they'll have to lower prices.",11236,True,1732114130.0,2024-11-20 15:48:50,111,185,stav_and_nick,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1gvr5wa/i_test_drove_a_bunch_of_evs_my_thoughts_on_the/,True,0.64,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1gydc1p,,Driving School,"Hi everyone. I’m at a crossroad and stuck with decision making.
I was in Aerospace (Boeing/Lockeed/SpaceX) and in 2022 I decided to start a driving school for teens. I had experience as an instructor when I was attending UCLA and was qualified to get a license (you’d need 2000 hours of experience, I had 5000 hours)
My ideas was to have an upscale driving school which really does high quality driving lessons. I’m based in LA. First year just with 1 car I did $4000 in sales (last 2 months of 2022), in 2023 I added a Tesla too (the other car is Honda HRV) and my sales were $36K. This year will be about $50K.
My biggest issue is instructors, I have no shortage of people calling. In 2022, 2023, and this year I just break even with no Salary for myself. I invested a lot of the profit in advertising and such. I spent $18K in Google ads in the last 2 years, but now I only spend $300/month and the phone doesn’t stop.
My dilemma is: should I get a huge loan like $200K-300K and hire full time positions, bigger office with driving simulators, basically going all out, or should I chill and keep going at this pace?
I worked 20 years in aerospace and am scared to lose my little condo I purchased in LA.
In my early 20s before attending ucla I had a successful clothing company for 9 long years but after 9/11 it imploded and I lost everything. So I’m scared.
My school has become very popular. I am the most expensive driving school in LA, and I constantly have to turn down clients because I don’t have the capacity. Just 2 cars and 1 instructor (myself) and 2 very part-time instructors.
Did I mention I only broke even? I reinvest every penny so that I don’t pay taxes (except payroll tax for instructors) Also my biggest cost is commercial car insurance for the 2 cars at $1200/month!
If I get more cars I can potentially pay $1200/year per car…

post,1gyznda,,Tesla Model Y Fatality Rates Exaggerated in ISeeCars Study,"TL;DR: The fatality rate in the study is overstated by almost 4x and the Model Y scores unremarkably in reality. This suggests the whole thing is bunk in the absence of clearer details surrounding methodology and data quality. 

Lars Moravy, VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla, has posted [the true Vehicle Miles Traveled for the Model Y](https://x.com/larsmoravy/status/1860100416819855492?s=46&t=zFWgbwSaBg4hfDSOnTly_g) on X to be > 7 billion which is used to calculate the fatality rate. 

I have downloaded the official FARS data from the [NHTSA](https://www.nhtsa.gov/file-downloads?p=nhtsa/downloads/FARS/) for 2020-2022 and filtered the *vehicle.csv* file in each one for the Model Y and occupant deaths. The Model Y was released in 2020 which is why these dates are used. 

This is done by filtering the VPICMODELNAME for “Model Y” and DEATHS > 0 for occupant deaths. This is documented on page 164 of the [FARS data manual](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813556). 

This yields the following occupant fatal crash counts:

- 2020: 0
- 2021: 7
- 2022: 13

So for 20 deaths between 7-8B VMT yields a true fatality rate between 2.5-2.86 per billion miles traveled. 

**This is significantly lower than the 10.6 reported in the study and is in-line with the overall average they reported at 2.8**. This suggests that the data they are using may have quality issues and we should likely reject the entire study without clearer details on methodology which are vague and obscure. 

[ISeeCars source link](https://www.iseecars.com/most-dangerous-cars-study)

If anyone is interested in [5 of the 7 fatal occupant crash summaries](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/s/lzdyg4Hur5) I wrote for the Model Y in 2021. Drunk/buzzed driving and seatbelts seem to be a key contributor. Also all were head-on collisions.

post,1h15mew,,Nissan Ariya - Review of Car  and Trim Comparisons - Best Value *Used* EV (IMHO),"So I spent 6+ months researching 2021-2023 used EVs as the depreciation hit is huge on them.

The Ariya stood as easily being the best value  IF you can handle the slower charging speed (see below). Part of the reason is that Nissan had a great lease offering on them and many people are now returning these. You can get them now 50% of MSRP.

There are two battery sizes the larger one is designated by the ""+"" after the model.  
There are 4 trims: Platinum > Empower > Evolve > Engage  
There is an AWD version: Eforce

Some combinations are only available together. For example there is ONLY a Platinum+ AWD it doesn't come in any other form.

The + gets you a 289 mile range in FWD and 267 in AWD. That being said, if you are in a warmer climate (I'm in Northern California) you can easily get above 300 miles in both forms driving in ECO mode. The smaller battery gets you 216 miles.

FWD gets you 237HP (0 to 60 in about 7 seconds) and AWD gets you 383HP (0 to 60 under 5 seconds).

All trims are very well appointed to the point of being semi-luxurious. On par or better than entry level luxury-branded EVs (i.e. MB EQB series).

Engage has many standard creature comforts (NAV, 2 x 12 inch screens, heated seats, semi-autonomous driving)  
Evolve adds a few things mainly parking sensors all around and panaromic sunroof, power lift gate  
Empower adds just autonomous driving  
Platinum adds Bose stereo system, standard AWD, Ambient active noise, motion activated gate, Napa leather, ventilated and heated seats.

I guess Nissan got burnt by the Leaf battery episode so all Ariya's have battery heaters and they very conservatively allow them to be charged. This results in maximum 130 Kw charging at fast chargers and 7.2 Kw charging at home which is relatively slow. But the silver lining is that the fast charging maximum rate is held above 50% at faster chargers.

Let's be honest the overvaluation is due to people having strong feeling for Elon Musk not bcs the company has an economic moat.

So the question we need to ask ourselves is: will the postive sentiment end at any point in the near future and honestly I do not think so. Bunch of recent tweets were pretty controversial and all that but I feel like this won't have any further impact atm. I just read they are recently started production on the newest Y model and it's supposed to be available in early 2025 so this might actually push the price up until then.

post,1h4063m,,A Second or Third Revisit of Why Warren Buffet May Not Have Fully Understood TSLA When He Said Value is Equivalent to the Whole Car Industry,"Hi investment friends, starting with the point of this analysis: Tesla, is a Wrigley's or a Coca Cola or our era but with a beyond imagining more future potential. 

Warren Buffett's although we love him, he's one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto ""invest in things you understand"" (it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz' most are very much understandable or it's just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as I call his favorites, assets like gum, candy, airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers) but there's still that constant, that he's not infallible. What it means to 'understand' has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before.

As most have said in the tech industry, sir Warren's fundamental which includes that it's highly speculative (also it's not on the record but it implies he's not into Elon Musk's kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but that's another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads Tesla) analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz' it's most likely incomplete.

post,1h9i57c,,"I'm bullish on Rivian, and here is why.","Currently holding 65 shares, looking to round that out to 100 next pay period.  I am not a financial advisor, and this is not investment advice. I am simply sharing my thoughts. 

These are the things I will be watching this year, to continue to add to my position, or to see if I should reconsider my bullish sentiment. 

1. Nearing profitability.  Rivian has recently re-affirmed that by Q4 2024 we will be seeing gross profit per vehicle. They are expected to deliver just over 50,000 vehicles for the year. That is a combination of mostly R1S and R1T with some of the Amazon delivery vans. If there guidance is correct, and they either meet or beat q4 '24 earnings, it is a bullish sign.

  
2. $6 Billion loan from Uncle Sam. Now the new administration does create a bit of tension here.  The new ""DOGE"" agency is going to be cutting Gov. spending across the board. There is some concern they will take away this loan that the Biden administration had given to Rivian. While this is certainly a possibility, I do not think it is going to happen. I think it would be a very bad look politically, and would give strength to the argument musk will us his Gov. connections to attack his competitors. Because of that, I think this money is safely staying with Rivian.  If it turns out DOGE is going to back down from this threat, that is another bullish sign.

  
3. VW Rivian joint venture. VW NA is about to change, they are getting a new CEO, Kjell Gruner, who previously was the President and CEO of Porsche Cars of North America and then moved to Rivian to be there ""Chief Commercial Officer & President, Business Growth"".  VW desperatley needs software expertise, and Rivian delivers that in spades. That combined with VWs massive buying and production power, is a strong match. This is a bullish sign right now, and what I think has been pushing to stock upwards. 

VW has been hurting and their reputation is in the pits.",3083,True,1733662070.0,2024-12-08 13:47:50,53,111,TheMensChef,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h9i57c/im_bullish_on_rivian_and_here_is_why/,True,0.63,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1hadsm9,,"We keep hearing about cheap Chinese vehicles. Most of them are utterly useless in the US. When made for US spec, Chinese vehicles aren't that cheap.","Recently, I had the chance to visit a company that does benchmarking for everyone, globally against global vehicles.

European, Chinese, Indian, South-East Asian, and even African models are there. Most of their business is for four wheelers, and especially in new energy vehicles (Chinese definition), not battery electric, plug-in hybrids. PHEVs are described as new energy in China. But they have a wide variety of Chinese battery electric vehicles, and special permits they can drive them on abandoned sections of roads, which they upgraded to feel like your regular highways, and some cars can be driven after a few hassles on highways.

BYD, Xiaomi, Nio, Zeekr, Geely, AION, xPeng, Hozon, Li, Singulato, Changfeng, Jingling - these were the brands that they had on hand.

My thoughts -

Many of them had impressive all electric range. On the CLTC.

In real world scenario,

CLTC<WLTC<EPA

EPA range figures, after the 2024 edition will be something that is the closest you'll get to. WLTC is worse than EPA, because of its Europe focused, where city speeds are significantly slower. European city limits usually top out at 50kmph, which is 31mph. For reference, arterial roads, will have speeds of 40-45 mph regularly, and some wider 3+3 lane arterial roads can have speeds as high as 50-55mph, especially in Texas and larger Western states. In that matter China is much closer to US, wide city crossing arterial roads can be as high as 75kmph.

Some of the smaller, cheaper vehicles wouldn't be allowed in the US, due to sorb (small overlap rigid barrier), front impacts, side impacts, and even rear impacts. The cost to get them to be US legal, would impact their cost, sometimes as much as 20%. So when you hear news about $10k electric car, be aware that just getting it to be road legal would make it $12k instantly.

Second is range figures. CLTC when stated is for Chinese style of driving. Straight, flat highways have speeds as high as 120km/h. Most will have limits of 100km/h.",3835,True,1733762111.0,2024-12-09 17:35:11,230,332,Ok-Pea3414,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1hadsm9/we_keep_hearing_about_cheap_chinese_vehicles_most/,True,0.7,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1hao94n,,The tariffs against Chinese vehicles makes sense after seeing the BYD Sealion,"Autogefuhl posted a review of it that I just noticed: [https://youtu.be/Vsejh-DtyxU?si=XN8lOWILcjAChkYh](https://youtu.be/Vsejh-DtyxU?si=XN8lOWILcjAChkYh)

59K Euro's for the top trip and Tesla still costs a few thousand Euro's more. Then there's the build quality of the Sealion, which blows Tesla out of the water. Then there's the features...heads up display, rotating display, car play and android auto, working wipers, range etc.

Here in Canada, the government is following the US, naturally, and is imposing a 100% tariff on Chinese EV's. Mind you, this is all happening while the very same peoples are shouting about the environment and climate change being \*the\* existential issue of our time.

I don't know how to feel. I understand why NA/EU are afraid of Chinese EV's, and people having jobs that pay well and with dignity is also critical; but I really hate how we keep getting bombarded with exceptionally pricey EV's and even no tax breaks or very little, all while people are struggling to survive. WTF are people supposed to do but stick with gasoline vehicles then? It's not like public transport is any good or timely in winter especially.

This whole environmental/government angle has shot itself in the foot with how this has been handled. 

Sealion top trim is roughly $44,000 CAD without tariffs, with tariffs it is $88,000 CAD. 

Tesla Model Y is roughly $67,000 CAD for the LR without any special paint or FSD, etc.

Tesla Model 3 is roughly $63,000 CAD for the LR without any special paint or FSD, etc.

\^ This, is ridiculous and no amount of protecting our industries to give them time to play catch up, makes it reasonable for consumers.

Yes, there are used EV's on the market and I am considering one myself, but by the same token, used Chinese EV's would be even cheaper still and still offer more!

post,1hcqtr1,,Returning to active stock portfolio management,"I recently decided to return to active stock portfolio management after my first attempt ended somewhat disastrously. To reconcile this experience and entertain others, I want to reflect on the mistakes I made and the new approaches I’ve adopted.

But first, briefly, the story of my initial failure.

When I started managing my portfolio, I quickly learned about the S&P 500 but was convinced I was smart enough to outperform the market. Arrogance was one of the main reasons for my downfall.

In 2019, I flirted with Bitcoin, which initially delivered great returns. Encouraged by the hype, I also invested heavily in PaySafe shortly after its IPO, believing in its potential because “everyone” said it was going to be great. At the same time, I was doing a lot of day trading. Looking back, I realize I wasn’t trading rationally. I’d look at graphs and invest simply because I felt the price would go up. I was taking desirable outcomes for granted.

Although I made a few conservative and reasonable investments, their success couldn’t offset the losses caused by Bitcoin’s decline, PaySafe’s terrible performance, and my risky trading. After 18 months, my portfolio was down 40%.

The arrogance I started with made the loss feel devastating. I abandoned my investment account for several years.

When I returned to it a year ago, I discovered that the growth of my conservative investments, along with Bitcoin’s recovery, had boosted my portfolio to 20% growth from my initial investment. I sold everything and bought into the S&P 500, feeling that I wasn’t capable of picking good stocks and should leave that to the fund. This turned out to be a good action, as the S&P 500 performed very well this year.

Now, I feel I’ve learned from my mistakes and am ready to approach active investing again. 

To avoid repeating the same mistakes, I’ve set specific rules to guide me:

post,1hcxguo,,"Model 3 Performance @ Streets of Willow: Touge Win, Lap Times, and EV Track Insights","I recently brought my Tesla Model 3 Performance out to a track event at Streets of Willow, organized by Corner-Exit.com. The schedule included a touge-style challenge and a traditional open lapping session afterward. The experience gave me a clearer understanding of how the Model 3 holds up when pushed in a competitive setting alongside traditional sports cars.

**Key Points:**

* **Touge Challenge:**
   * Cars involved: Tesla Model 3 Performance (my car), a Miata, and a 350z.
   * Advantage in EV: The standing start benefited the Tesla’s instant torque, consistently delivering 3.1s 0-60 launches simply by pressing the pedal.
   * Outcome: I took the top time of the day for the entire field of 50+ cars and managed to edge out the other cars Mod class, partly due to this strong start, although the Nexen N’Fera Sport R tires took some time to come into their proper operating range.
* **Open Lapping Sessions:**
   * Times: The Miata posted a 1:21.8, the 350z ran consistent 1:22s, and I recorded a best of 1:23.
   * Takeaway: While the Tesla excels at straight-line acceleration, its overall lap pace was slightly behind the top competitors, showing where EV performance stands against well-sorted ICE setups on a tighter track.
* **Side-by-Side Comparisons:**
   * To better understand performance differences, the 350z driver and I ran laps close together to compare corner exit speeds, braking points, and power delivery. It provided useful insights into where the Tesla’s torque advantage helped and where it couldn’t match a traditional RWD platform’s handling balance.

I’ve compiled footage from the event, including on-track video, telemetry overlay, and commentary, to help illustrate how the Tesla performed, what challenges I encountered, and what improvements could be made.

post,1heu8rp,,The EV-9 solves our 3 adult seating problem ,"TLDR I’m no longer squished between my children in the back seat when my husband, my mom, my two kids and I go out somewhere.

We had a difficult time finding an electric car that could solve for our 3 adults plus 2 kids (1 car seat, 1 low booster). Whether we took our gas CX5 or Genesis GV60 I would end up sitting between the kids. At one point we bought my sister’s Volvo XC40 and had to sell it a week later because it had a hump in the middle of the back seat floor and was the worst by far.

Before I say anything else: between my sister’s and my family, we’ve owned a Tesla Model X, some sort of Tesla sedan, a Rivian R1S, the Volvo (all them) and the GV60 and EV9 (us). THERE IS NO PERFECT EV for big families/3 adults. Some of the issues I’ve seen/experienced (none new but bear repeating):

1) Model X: Putting aside any personal feelings about Musk, the 3rd row is super uncomfortable. I had to sit back there once and aside from feeling like I was in danger of being crushed the entire time, my 5’2” body was very uncomfortable. That said, after taking the GV60 on a terrifying road trip through SE Texas, I’d be nervous to take a non-Tesla on a road trip through this state again.

2) My sister loves her Rivian. My husband and I don’t love how “tanky” it feels to drive, but also we didn’t experiment with any of the settings. Regardless, the third row there is also exceedingly uncomfortable for a grown person (and again, I’m only 5’2”.) Due to car seat/booster needs/safety/daily use, an occasional adult passenger would likely go back there. the Also duh, it’s really pricey

3) The GV60 isn’t a three row, but it was what we used for over a year. I love that car. I love its features, the way it drives.

I know you can save a lot by charging at home, and you can save even more with TOU rates. However, I’m not sure if it makes sense for me to enable TOU rates. 

We are a household of 2 people (me and my fiancee) and 2 cars (1 EV, 1 ICE). 

One reason I don’t think it’s be good is we work separate shifts. My fiancee begins her work days M-F around 4:00am to get ready for work, and leaves the house around 5:00am ish. She returns home around 6:30pm. She often spends her nights doing laundry, and watching TV. She usually goes to sleep around 9:00 and sometimes I come home to find her asleep on the couch with the tv still on. 

My work days, typically M-Th, begin around 11:30am, and I leave around 1:00pm and I get home around 12:30am. I’ll usually stay up for 1-2 ½ hours after I get home relaxing before I go to bed, I’m usually on my phone so not directly using electricity. On Friday’s I’m usually home, however I do work the occasional overtime shift consisting of anywhere from 6-8 hours of work. If I don’t work on Friday, I usually spend my day off watching tv or playing video games (on Xbox) if that matters. 

On the weekends we are both home usually and spend the weekend watching tv shows, playing video games and doing laundry. 

Our big electrical usage comes from A/C (which we don’t really use during the summer, only if it gets really humid out), our washing machine and dryer, and now the EV charger. We live in an older home, and sometime run an electric space heater in our bedroom before we fall asleep during the winter, usually for 30-60 minutes. We live in southern Wisconsin and our electric (and natural gas) provider is WE Energies. Our most recent bill had us using 879 KWH priced at 0.17154/kwh, for a total of $150.78.

post,1hfprfx,,Savings Diversity - General Questions,"So I have a general question about the cash that I'm keeping on hand.

I have about 40K in savings right now. Here is the breakdown:

33K in a HYS (3.8 APY)

6K in a different HYS (6.5 APY but I can only add 2K per month so I have an automatic transfer from the 3.8 account into this one. Every year the money all gets kicked out in August so it's a constant cycle)

$750 initially invested right now (650 in VTI/VOO ETFS - 100 in Tesla Stock)

I have about 13k in retirement as well (70% low risk 30% moderate risk)

Should I have more of my money invested into S&P ETFs that would likely outpace the 3.9 HYS? What do you think my diversity should be between all of these options? Are there other options I should look into?",725,False,1734373599.0,2024-12-16 19:26:39,3,0,Sure-Race-2650,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfprfx/savings_diversity_general_questions/,True,0.8,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1hfqs76,,3 years and 143k km with an EV in extreme cold Canada,"We live in prairie Canada so everything is in $CAD. We also get extreme cold (-30C to -40C or -22F to -40F) regularly. We bought an EV 2 years ago and it seems like everywhere we go, people are really interested in it. I did a 2 year, 109k km review that can be read [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatchewan/comments/18mysor/2_years_and_109k_km_with_an_ev_in_sk/) It goes into the background about why we decided to go the route we did, which EV's we considered, etc. Basically we drive a lot and were spending a ridiculous amount on fuel so wanted to reduce our costs. We have done that.

We decided to purchase a Tesla Model 3 because it was the cheapest AWD EV we could get and the Tesla fast charging (Level 3) infrastructure is vastly superior to anything else. Now, I don't think a new Tesla would be the best option for us. Used EV's are actually available now and prices have dropped a bunch. We would definitely go that route if we were to buy now. Tesla Superchargers are now open to a bunch of different companies and more will be added soon. The Tesla (NACS) charge part is now the standard that most EVs are using or will be using soon.

When charging at home, we use the mobile charger that was included with the vehicle. We just bought a couple adaptors for it. We installed a NEMA 14-50 plug in the garage. We did this ourselves for material cost, which was about $75. At the max 32 amps, it charges at 10% an hour. We park in a heated (5C) garage year round, but that is not a requirement.

For the life of the vehicle, we are averaging 210 Wh/km. Typical home power costs about $0.15/kWh. So on average, I can go about 5 km on 1.05 kW of power. Put another way, to go 100km costs about $3.25 with home charging. This pretty good considering the climate here. We have added solar to our home, so we try to charge as much as possible when the sun is shining, reducing our cost even more when we can.

Unfortunately, Tesla has increased the fast charging costs, again.",5240,True,1734376133.0,2024-12-16 20:08:53,125,30,SkPensFan,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1hfqs76/3_years_and_143k_km_with_an_ev_in_extreme_cold/,True,0.96,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1hfr8dz,,Achieved my first milestone after 3 years!,"After 3 years of investing, I've finally achieved my goal of investing my first $100,000! This was a challenge I gave myself after hearing Warren Buffet say you should strive to invest 100k into the market. *(I know that by now it's inflated to likely be the equivalent of 300k, but that's my next goal.)*

I did this by living with my parents and paying low but fair rent, finding a decent job that pays 75k-80k a year, avoiding fast food where possible, and just being frugal in general. 

**Investment strategy:**

1. investing $10 every business day into both VOO and VOOG. *(roughly $400 a month)*  
2. investing in Tesla when Tesla is low. *(this is 20% of my portfolio. My largest position.)*  
3. keeping my ear to the ground, and capitalizing on things like meta's stock devaluing. *(Though, I totally missed Nvidia sadly.)*  
4. diversifying into other promising tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google. *(less than fruitful, but it's still diversified.)*

I think the riskiest strategy has been in Tesla. In the past, it's been difficult watching the stock go up and down, but I had faith in their business practices and ethics. Now Tesla is popping off, and given Elon's position with Trump, this should give room for Tesla to continue its growth. Sadly, because of that, I can't view Tesla as much as an ethical company as much as I could in the past, but that won't diminish it's ability to grow and I see the stock continuing to rise in the future.

**Looking forward:**

Since Tesla isn't going to be low for some time, one thing I want to invest in going forward is in clean power companies, such as nuclear for AI companies. So I'll continue looking into that for future paychecks to go to. Any recommendations are welcome!

My next goal will be to reach $300,000 invested by the end of 2026. What do you all think? Achievable?",1850,False,1734377264.0,2024-12-16 20:27:44,75,25,zerossoul,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfr8dz/achieved_my_first_milestone_after_3_years/,True,0.85,2024,both,search,False,False,0,
post,1hfs25j,,"Reminder: If You Trade More, Wall Street Makes More Money","I've spent a few years reading Warren Buffett and other value investors. Essentially what I learned is that they make money by other people pushing prices too high or too low. Especially when prices become too low, they swoop in and buy a bunch. Next they sit on it a few years until the price goes to the correct valuation again, or preferably after many years when the company deteriorates.

Time and time again, people have predicted that Buffett's strategy will eventually stop working. We nowadays can learn much more etc etc.

Yet, stock prices are all over the place. Tesla doubled in the last 3 months for example. How is that possible? How can a 1T dollar company double in value in 3 months? They still build the same stuff with roughly the same people. Similar for Bitcoin. Also almost doubled in a few months. If that was inevitable according to some metric, then why was it not priced in?

At the same time, there is a common sentiment online that the world is becoming more and more unequal. More wealth accumulates in the hands of a few people.

So let me say this: if you are currently considering buying into some stock that went up recently, please let me remind you that there is only one party that will always make money from your trade. It's not you. It's your broker/Wall Street. They don't care whether you make money or lose money. Some will slam ""price targets"" on stocks if that makes you trade. Some will call other stocks ""uninvestible"" if that makes you trade.",1490,False,1734379359.0,2024-12-16 21:02:39,0,9,rik-huijzer,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfs25j/reminder_if_you_trade_more_wall_street_makes_more/,True,0.37,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1hfsd4p,,It’s 2023: MY HW3 and HW4 feels misleading,"I bought my 2023 MYLR AWD back in Feb 2023 and I absolutely love it. At the time, I had no idea what HW3 was and didn’t really pay attention, especially since Tesla doesn’t label the cars with the HW version. Couple months later, I find out HW4 was being added to the 2023 MY… same design, same price, same model, only difference is the hardware. So now there are 2 versions of the same car from the same year, one with HW3 and one with HW4. At the time I remember people on reddit were debating if the car they just saw had HW3 or HW4. Others advising everyone to wait until HW4 start to officially roll. And some were getting there reserved car as HW4 and others as HW3 depending on where you are and which gigafactory made your car. It was a chaos, and it felt super misleading from Tesla.

Don’t get me wrong, I still love my car, I’m not planning to upgrade anytime soon, “maybe I’m a bit upset that my 2 years old car feels obsolete now “ but I barely even use FSD (only when I get a free month lol) but why doesn’t Tesla make it clear what hardware version you’re getting? Maybe it’s buried in the serial number or something, but it should definitely be more obvious. Like, imagine Apple selling 2 iPhones with the same model, year, and design but totally different cameras!

post,1hfy0q8,,Ponzi Spotting: a laymen's guide to differentiating investments from Ponzi schemes,"I often see things being called Ponzi schemes on Reddit that are very much not Ponzi schemes. Usually, it always stems from the criticism that a particular investment only goes up in price because someone newer is paying a higher price for it. Hence, it must be a Ponzi.

I’m going to blow your minds a little bit. 

Almost all (legitimate) investments require new investors willing to pay a higher price for older investors to cash out a profit. 

Most investable objects, REGARDLESS of what underlies the object, trade at a price on a market. This means, at the margin, some percentage (usually only a small percentage) of the total available supply of the object is trading hands. The trade is priced typically in your local fiat currency, but this does not necessarily have to be the case. Prices are determined by supply and demand. When an investable object goes up in price on a market, it means there were no sellers of the object at the lower price, and price goes up until the next marginal seller decides they are willing to part with that object at the higher price. 

The use of the term investable object is intentionally left extremely broad. It essentially means anything quantifiable that can be owned and traded. This includes contracts, stocks, bonds, physical objects, digital objects, etc. 

**Example 1.** You bought a 1st edition charizard for 20 dollars when it came out in the 1990’s. Since it was relatively abundant (still being printed by the company) and Pokemon was relatively new at the time, the supply was high and the demand was low. Fast forward 30 years, Pokemon is super popular and there are very few 1st edition charizards remaining (out of print for decades, many were lost or destroyed through the years). You now are able to sell the charizard for 10,000 dollars to a guy that just got into Pokemon card collecting. Congratulations, you bought low and sold high!",8974,True,1734395057.0,2024-12-17 01:24:17,0,8,TheKFChero,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfy0q8/ponzi_spotting_a_laymens_guide_to_differentiating/,True,0.42,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1hg9dgm,,[GB] A quick write-up of my recent 660mile / 1062km road trip.,"I recently purchased a BYD Seal Excellence (aka Performance, aka 3.8S). The timing couldn’t have been more perfect as last minute plans sprung up to visit friends around the country; one flying in from the United States to meet with mutual friends just outside Birmingham England, and more who live up in Glasgow Scotland.

[Charging at Skelton Lake Services, Leeds](https://preview.redd.it/4s7gz5so6e7e1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a4d1945f38fbc121afdc0160c8b3feb1014e908)

It’s raining, freezing temperatures, and it’s windy. It’s the worst possible scenario for any car, but especially an EV with an Iron Phosphate battery. I’m a responsible little gremlin and take regular breaks at least every two hours so I planned a stop at the new Skelton Lake services in Leeds as having never done a long journey in this car I was unsure how it would perform in poor weather at motorway speeds, thus I decided to get a top-up.

I connected to an Ionity brand charger and used my “Octopus Electroverse” card to initiate and pay for the charge. For those not in the know, my home energy provider (Octopus Energy) dished out free RFID cards for people on EV tariffs; at a supported charger you simply tap it as you would a debit or credit card and the charge will be billed to your electricity bill. Honestly fantastic and I wish it was universal given my account is constantly in credit. Regardless of what card you use, you simply connect the plug and tap once.

I only added 14.54kWh to the battery as I got a coffee and cinnamon bun in the frankly lovely Skelton Services (North Americans, take note, this is what a motorway stop should be rather than the depressing gas stations with half a Wendys stapled to them I had to endure in Canada and the north eastern US).

post,1hgkgpz,,Added a 2nd EV This Weekend!,"For the past few months, my husband (43M) & I (39F) have done a ton of EV research with the plan to buy or lease a second one in late spring. After the US election results, we decided to move that timeline up to…now. Financially, that actually wound up being a better decision because of end of year deals & incentives.

I currently drive a 2022 MINI Cooper SE. Her name is Winnie Cooper. She gets about 110 miles of range per charge. Our other car is, legally my grandmother-in-law’s, a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee with quite a few miles on it. Cosmetically, it’s in GREAT shape. His grandparents took really good care of it. Mechanically, something needs fixed about every other month now & we decided it was time to get something new.

Neither of us have a commute & we live in the city, so Winnie’s been perfectly adequate for around town driving. We need a larger vehicle for several reasons - my husband’s family lives about 60 miles away & Winnie is not able to do the drive on a single charge. They’re in a more rural area and there is literally one charger near there. It’s a Level 2 and it’s at a casino. The charging is free but the gambling is not! We also have 2 giant dogs & neither fit in Winnie. So even just going to the vet, we need something to haul them in. Add in the occasional CostCo run and it’s just easier to have a larger car for those trips.

I set some parameters - budget (less than $1000/month including insurance), size (has to fit in the garage but also has to fit dogs), BEV (no plug-in hybrid, regular hybrid, ICE, etc), & range (over 200 miles). We compiled a list of contenders & on Saturday set out about 10a to go drive a whole bunch of cars. The convenient thing about our metro area - there’s a street that has basically every car dealer you can think of in a 3 mile stretch (except Ford, for whatever reason). I chose not to test drive anything.

Current battery is 24kWh at 37% SOH, new one should be 40kWh with at least 85% SOH on all modules.   Battery was on sale for just under $8k, install is $1k and with tax it's a hair under 9500 total.  (Yes, I know I could get a new Leaf for a similar price, the rest of the car is great and I wanna pass it down to my kid one day)

So far the process hasn't been great honestly but I'm hoping that will change now that they have both the battery and the car in-hand.   

The TL;DR is that I completely understand that delays happen, especially around the holidays - but I think it's pretty lame that I've gotta chase them down to get any sort of info.  

  
Back in November I had some free time so I decided to swing by the shop and pop in to check the place out and hopefully schedule our upgrade.  Arrived to find nobody answering my knocks on the door so I called the main line and the person I spoke to said they're appointment-only as their team is often out doing mobile hybrid installs.  OK, my mistake.    
  
So I placed the order for our battery through the person I was talking to at the time and was told they were a little backed up so it might be a week or two before they call us to schedule.  Understandable, no worries.      That day was Nov 11.  

Didn't hear anything from them, gave it some extra time for the Thanksgiving holiday and Dec 2 I called the main number to get a status update.   Was transferred to the DC shop and left a voicemail.   No response.   Next morning, same thing - call, transfer, voicemail, crickets.  Called again that afternoon and pointed out that taking our deposit and then ignoring us wasn't the best new customer experience and eventually got a call back from someone (shop manager IIRC?) who said they've got 2 other cars ahead of us and we should expect to drop off the car sometime the week before Xmas (this week, 12/16-20).",3171,True,1734644824.0,2024-12-19 22:47:04,13,20,nerdy_hippie,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1hi4190/upgrading_our_2013_leaf_battery_from_24_to_40kwh/,True,0.82,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

It's always tough to see looking forward (it's always looking back of course that one see gems that could be hidden), though I always look at who's creating what, who's the real leader and Canoo's leader seems maybe a few percentages of Elon Musk. 

The Canoo founder has a lot of patents it seems, innovative it seem similar to Elon (but not as big like Elon's pre-Tesla and SpaceX, like PayPal or Zip2) had a successful venture (Solera I think). 

But only time will tell if the pattern will repeat itself with Canoo, it has a great design, innovative, especially their MPDV (I wish that was the one they focused on but had a smaller non-van version with the same). It just needs to launch already their working models (unlike that Nikola truck which even got GM fooled) have amazing design especially the shelf mechanism of their nice looking MPDV. 

If they just did a pre-order which is a genius strategy pioneered by amazing Apple, God-willing they will break through but they also need to upgrade their battery from 200mi to 320mi for good measure.

I think at first glance, some will say that there is a little redundancy here, such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism, although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually, in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds.

It has 360 cameras which is great but i’m looking at getting a dash cam fitted.

Long shot but is there a dash cam out there that integrates into the system? It seems crazy that the car has the features to allow dash cam support with the 360 cameras but the car doesn’t have the capability to record. 

I’m hoping that MG add it into a future software update but looking unlikely. My partner has a Tesla model 3 and it’s great that the car comes with a built in dash cam that records automatically.

Main feature it would need would be to start recording if anything touches the car so that if someone hits me when away from the car it records it.

Of course the US consumer has gobbled this up. So you have auto makers marketing these larger vehicles and US consumers growing accustomed to them. It’s a “virtuous” cycle that results in larger and larger vehicles across the spectrum. 

With cafe rules essentially being irrelevant for EV’s (or am I missing something), will manufacturers and consumers ever reverse trend?

I've been looking at used Model Y's for a while now, and I've decided I’m gonna get one, particularly one with FSD due to vision issues that impair my ability to drive. (I can still see well enough to drive manually if need be, it’s just the fact that I’m legally (half) blind and have bad peripheral vision makes it difficult, especially in bad weather or at night.)

(Just use public transit or bike! I hear you say. No. I can’t ride a bike due to medical conditions and public transport here in the US where I live is frankly shit. A car is my only way of getting around quickly.)

(Keep in mind: I haven’t actually received or insured the vehicle yet, I’m in the process of going through financials at this point, and I hope to get one sometime within the coming months.)

However, my family (more specifically my father) doesn't like them at all. 

He always brings up ""horror stories"" of Tesla's dying and breaking down all the time, poor reliability, cars needing expensive repairs, slow charging times/not being able to charge anywhere, bad build quality, etc.

I know at least some of it is inaccurate, but him saying all these bad things all the time is putting me on the fence. I'm just curious on how many of his statements hold up, if at all.

post,1hnmey6,,Counting EVs on the highway for fun (it's not),"Don't read this (or too much **into** this) unless you are as bored as I was. Every conclusion here is a small sample of observable stuff during a trip, so take it with a pinch of road salt.

**TLDR** : The Equinox EV is selling more than I thought, and Nissan EVs apparently can't go on the highway (joke, of course). Read more for my hot takes that will undoubtedly change your life.

I spent too much time doing this for its actual relevance. I'm off work and I do what I please with my own time, thank you very much

The other day I was a passenger on a pretty slow day on the highway with a couple of hours to go. Decided to count every visually-obvious BEV either oncoming or passing us (we were going 100 kph in our Bolt EV, so we didn't really pass anyone ourselves except some vans and the occasional slow semi). Driving on the A20 transcanadian highway in Québec, in cold temp (about -10 Celsius, so I expected to see less of short-ranged EVs). I thought I'd see something interesting during our 2 hours trip, and that it would be a fun (ok, not *very* fun, but I wasn't driving), objective way of figuring out popular brands and models... with some caveats :

* I probably did not recognize or spot every model, especially models that have ICE counterpart (ie : Soul and Kona)
* At some point we were in a traffic jam and some occurences might have been either missed or misindentified because of cars partially hidden.
* I did not include PHEV even if some are easy to recognize (ie : the Prius), because that would be unfair to other PHEVs that are very similar to ICE models
* I get distracted, sometimes. Let's assume it affected every model equally and move on.

Here's the list of EVs I spotted, by brand in alphabetical order (If I forgot a brand or model, it's because I didn't see it anyway) :

**BMW** : 2 total

* 2 unknown SUVs (I don't know their models but they were definitely EVs)

**Cadillac** : z e r o

**Chevrolet (and Hummer)** : 40 total (#1)

post,1hnpnj4,,Audi EV Range Monitor Gauging Problems - can this be fixed?,"Greetings, 

My question for you is - do you know of anyone who has had this problem - is it fixable?

I bought a new Audi 2023 Q5 Sportback in January 2023.  I had had a Tesla Model X for 5 years, so am familiar with EVs, charging, range monitor, battery usage, etc.

I started having problems with the range monitor, although at the time, I didn't know that was the problem.  I took the car to the dealer in Jan 2024, after less than a year of ownership, because I couldn't get it to charge to the regular 227 miles when the Audi app was showing 100%.

Just a few facts: I live in the balmy San Francisco Bay Area, and my car is always in my garage, which almost never dips below 50 degrees.  My driving habits haven't changed.  My use of the heater, AC, seat heater haven't changed.  I live at 150 feet elevation and almost all of my driving is on relatively flat land.  

I have brought my car to the dealer three times to fix this problem; they've had it for a total of 14 days.  Their response to me:  no repairs needed 

Here is some of my recent driving data:

I drove 1.5 miles to the store and back.  Here is what the  range monitor showed during the 3-mile roundtrip:

Range shown   Mileage

   204                20,434

   194                 20,434

   165                  20,435

   167                  20,435

   223                 20,437

   202                 20,437

   225                 20,437



Additionally, here are some examples of when I charged it on different days to 100% 

192 miles of range shown on range monitor

211

227

215

162

168

204

215

220

203



This is not affected by the temperature nor my driving.  These are extremes, and I had this car for a year with out these wild vacillations.

Again, my question for you is - do you know of anyone who has had this problem - is it fixable?

Thank you so much for reading all of this.

I recently had the BMW iX M60 for a week as a loaner. I have driven most of the EVs out there, including another week long road tripper (the Mercedes EQS), currently own a Hyundai IONIQ 6, a BMW X5 and BMW M3. I decided to provide some info about my experience road tripping this iX M60 for a week and 700 miles with my family over the Christmas holiday while my wife’s X5 was in the shop. 

Spoiler: not terribly impressed! 

I did use ChatGPT to format this review a bit nicer and closer to a more traditional automotive review, hope no one is too upset but your reading experience is much improved trust me. 

2024 BMW iX M60: A Mixed Bag of Innovation and Compromise

The BMW iX M60 enters the crowded luxury EV market with the promise of blending BMW’s trademark driving dynamics with cutting-edge electrification. Positioned as a performance-oriented alternative to the likes of the Mercedes EQS SUV and Tesla Model X, the iX M60 seeks to redefine what a premium electric SUV can be. Yet, after a week of real-world testing, including a 700-mile road trip, it’s clear that the iX is both a showcase of BMW’s engineering prowess and a reminder of where the brand’s EV journey still falls short.

Charging Woes: A Pain Point for the Price

For an EV that commands a base price north of $112,000, charging performance is a glaring weakness. The iX M60’s advertised fast-charging capability of up to 195kW seems promising on paper, but in practice, it struggles to maintain consistent speeds. Over the course of our trip, the vehicle averaged an underwhelming 90kW at 350kW-capable stations, often dropping to 135kW or lower within minutes. This resulted in 40-minute waits to charge from 20% to 80%, a frustrating reality in a segment where faster charging curves are becoming the norm.",6656,True,1735352092.0,2024-12-28 03:14:52,0,32,SneakyHobbitses1995,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1hnvez0/a_review_of_the_bmw_ix_m60_after_a_week_long_road/,True,0.44,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1hnwhlf,,Tesla's Genius Autonomous Strategy and Implied Supremacy,"Tesla's autonomous program FSD (Full Self-Driving) will inevitably become the prime competitor in the U.S. to Waymo, and the leader everywhere else where it is legal. I have this conviction because I can look clearly at the actual comparisons of the vehicles statistics rather than their permit level. The reason that it makes sense to ignore the permit level, is that Tesla intentionally declares their autonomous program at Level 2 Autonomy to avoid the increased regulations on testing that Level 3 or Level 4 incur. 

Essentially, what Tesla has seemingly believed from the inception of their FSD program, was that **more Data = better system**. And I agree with them. If we look at any machine learning program or deep learning that has aimed to create a high fidelity system, most of the time the **sheer scale of data has increased output quality immensely**. In deploying their FSD to independent owners who supervise it, they essentially are able to scale their data collection **without** hiring and deploying ""skilled safety testers"" like Waymo has had to in the past to collect data and train their model, giving them a huge leg up in cost efficiency and scalability. 

People don't realize how good Tesla's FSD because of Autopilot's failures. The rollout of Autopilot and the marketing of it has a lot of criticism for good reason, but Full Self-Driving may as well be a different system with how markedly different the crash rates between them are. This is also combined with the fact that **Waymo vehicles have not operated on freeways** while Tesla vehicles have. Waymo only recently began testing on freeways, which is quite insane to me because how can anyone believe that Waymo has achieved technological supremacy when they only started testing on freeways a few months ago?? 

**All of these reasons contribute to my belief that Tesla will achieve Level 5 Autonomy first**.

Whilst I was doing so the question above popped into my head, and I realised I had no idea whether the richest man in the world, who is regularly hailed as a genius, has actually made a total net profit across his companies. For this question I'm only counting the relatively mature ones, namely Tesla, Space X, Twitter, Starlink, SolarCity and The Boring Company. It doesn't seem fair to include Neuralink or any others than are still very much in R&D phase.

Two of these companies - SpaceX and Starlink - are doing very well currently, and look well set for future growth, Tesla is doing OK but there are warning lights flickering, and as for the others, well....

What I'm really interested though is, at this point in history, two specific questions:

2) how the collective profits (if any) of these companies compares to the investment that they have taken in to date, ie their collective return on investment.  
  
I appreciate these could be seen as unfair questions to ask, as that investment was premised on significant further growth far into the future (even when, as with Tesla, those projections stopped making much sense a long time ago), but nevertheless I still think its worth asking, given that in the here and now Musk himself is using the wealth accrued from these companies to such dramatic effect.

post,1ik6eh5,,I’m stuck in life and need some guidance on what to do next,"Hiya everyone,

I’m 23, living in Kent UK and feeling a bit lost in life. I’m not sure what direction to take and don’t really have anyone to ask for advice. I want to feel achieved, leave my mark on the world, and of course, earn a living. Here’s a bit about me:
	•	I graduated in 2022 with a degree in Industrial Design but haven’t done much design work since.
	•	My previous jobs include working in an acrylic-making factory, co-owning a coffee trailer, and waitressing, and in lockdown I started a 3D printing and Vinyl business for small accessories and personalised products. 
	•	I currently live at home with my family, which I’m happy with for now. My mum had a stroke just over a year ago, so I’ve been caring for her, and my parents have been financially supporting me (I’m super grateful for them).
	•	I’d love to own a business someday rather than work for someone else, but I don’t know what kind of business that should be. I’ve enjoyed the business ventures I’ve tried so far. 
	•	I enjoy design, but my drawing skills aren’t great. I do love working with tools like Fusion 360 and Adobe Illustrator. I feel like I’m “okay” at a lot of things but not excellent at any one thing.
	•	I love hands-on work like model-making and prototyping which is definitely in some of my hobbies like puzzles, Lego, and Rokr sets.
	•	I’m passionate about mental health. My final university project was a bench concept designed to encourage conversation without the pressure of eye contact—it’s still one of my proudest creations and the model still sits on my shelf. 
	•	I also enjoy cooking, being outdoors, hiking, and geocaching, it’d be great to merge some of my hobbies into a business. 

I’ve been considering starting a graphic design business, but I feel like I’d need to learn a lot more before feeling confident. I’ve done some logos and posters here and there, but I’m worried my creativity isn’t strong enough to stand out.",2943,True,1738964138.0,2025-02-07 22:35:38,0,4,Elsclrkdesign,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1ik6eh5/im_stuck_in_life_and_need_some_guidance_on_what/,True,0.5,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1j1shxe,,"First 100 person, $200 billion in revenue organization.","A thought occured to me while posting elsewhere.

Initially, I believed every DOGE cut was to protect Elon Musk and the other oligarchs, but mostly Elon. It's not about government savings.  

* CFPB to prevent lawsuites against Musk's Tesla, et al.
* FAA for SpaceX
* IRS for Billionaires and tax enforcement
* NIH for NeuroLink
* Treasury for payment funneling

**HOWEVER, at the end of the day, I think Elon has another end goal:** 

DOGE is training various AI models on massive amounts of government data to ultimately ensure an Elon AI model(s) will be embedded permanantly into the US government making pennies off each prompt. Leading to the first 100 person, $200 billion in revenue organization.  

Privatized AI government employees. An organization that will never by publically traded.

post,1j8d48n,,DANGER: DO NOT TOW WITH A CYBERTRUCK? - (catastrophic failure test),"Video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubUXNSWGth0, quite the title

Description:  The Tesla Cybertruck is built with a cast aluminum frame <redacted sponsor> This helps the cyber truck be manufactured extremely quickly. However - cast aluminum is not good for towing as we see in this Cybertruck durability test video. The hitch breaks around 10,000 pounds. (4500kg) Which is far too close to the 11,000 pound towing capacity. Yikes. 

Saw the video circulating around reddit with outrage elsewhere, was looking for some discussion. Thousands of valid reasons to hate the cybertruck and the company behind it, but unless I am missing something it seems like the cybertruck did quite good here no? He put pretty much pure tongue load on that hitch, the tongue weight rating on this is 1,100lbs from tesla, and it only failed @ 10,000lbs, nearly 10x. 

Justification given for the test in the video was that with improper loading or an impact trailer weight can/will be converted to tongue weight, but I feel that is user error and under similar circumstances the rivian wouldn't fare particularly well either. I think SAE standard here its 50% GVWR x/y and 150% z, which it would pass fine. 

Could argue that the failure mode isn't ideal as demonstrated in the whistlindiesel video, and the properties of aluminum aren't ideal for a truck & perhaps we will see failure over time, but it seems to me like he proving tesla's engineering right here? (and as an aside, his explanation of fatigue limit was backwards). Same thing with the glue, modern 3M panel bond & similar adhesive hold up just as well & often better than welding, cars are full of structural adhesives. 

I don't really get the point of the video, nor the ""yikes"" response, I feel content like this takes away from the hundreds of real issues with these products.",2241,True,1741650204.0,2025-03-11 00:43:24,0,97,hi_im_bored13,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1j8d48n/danger_do_not_tow_with_a_cybertruck_catastrophic/,True,0.45,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1jaowts,,How many of us would be sad if Nissan went under?,"I know a lot of Reddit loves to clown on Nissan, but at one point they were one of the best in their game. The Y61 Patrol, the 300ZX, the S-chassis Silvias, the R32/33/34 GT-Rs - these were legendary cars, and even their VIP sedans like the Laurel, Cima, Cefiro (especially when the Cefiro was RWD in its first generation,) Cedric, Gloria and the like were great. In the US, the original Pathfinders were 4Runner, Blazer and Discovery competitors, while the Sentra SE-R proved that even compact sedans could be fun - something we see with a lot more of today's compact sedans (like the Elantra N, for example.)

Even into the 2000s, when Nissan was already starting their decline, they put out some bangers - the G35/37 (Skyline) was seen as what the Z buyer got after starting a family - the performance of a sports car with the added practicality of a sedan. The M35/45 (Fuga/Gloria) was a super underrated luxury sedan that offered a compelling alternative to the Lexus GS and a way to get an otherwise-JDM only product in left hand drive. The FX35/45 was a trendsetter in the luxury SUV world - it paved the way for the Porsche Cayenne, Land Rover Range Rover Sport, and other sportier luxury SUVs as well. The 350/370Z were widely celebrated at launch - a sports car for the 21st century, one of the best-handling cars this side of a 911 and a worthy model to carry the iconic badge. And even their regular stuff wasn't half bad - V6 Altimas and Maximas in the USA were sleepers - the V6 Altima had more power than the Camry, Accord or Mazda6, the XTerra was another 4Runner alternative, the Primera was a competitive hatch in Europe, the original X-Trail came from an era when crossovers were still fun and cute and not every other car on the road, and the Elgrand minivan in Japan oozed VIP elegance in that oh-so-JDM way.",3386,True,1741905574.0,2025-03-13 23:39:34,0,32,thats__hot,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1jaowts/how_many_of_us_would_be_sad_if_nissan_went_under/,True,0.43,2025,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1jfkoj5,,I legit don't understand the Elon/Tesla hate.,"Hey guys,

I've been a fan of Elon for a very long time. I've read both biographies, watched easily \~80%+ of his interviews (there are a LOT out there now), and I resonate deeply with so much of how he thinks and what he does for the world.

That said, clearly, he's rubbed some people the wrong way.  
At the very least, there's a lot hatred being directed his way.

I'd love to explore this with people and help bridge what seems to be a growing divide.

I think the first step is by beginning to understand the people who do have hatred for Elon & Tesla, why that hatred is there?

I trust that more people than not genuinely want good things for the world, so I think we have that in common, and I'd like to build on that.

Following Adolf Hitlers propaganda and causing destruction on civilians is what actual Nazis did.

post,1jfpo6n,,I’ve been very impressed by BYD while visiting Brazil,"I’ve been in Brazil for 15 days and love this BYD dolphin. When I first saw it, I did not love the styling, but it’s been an absolute joy. I’ve driven Teslas (model 3 and model y) up and down California numerous times. The BYD feels more luxurious and less cheap in almost every way. 


I have not experienced a single phantom breaking while in a BYD. I had 3 in one day the last time I drove a Tesla. On the byd, the driver assistance has just worked. 


The interior is MUCH better. Tesla seats and interiors feel cheap. The stealing wheels wear quickly due to how thin the material is. I thought a Tesla was quiet due to the lack of ICE, but the BYD has much less road noise on wayyy shittier cobblestone roads. The seats are more comfortable and EVERY surface material feels more less cheap and flimsy.


The car is much more intuitive than a Tesla. The Tesla OS is always a pain to figure out where basic shit is. I had to pull over and watch a YouTube video to figure out how to do something on a road, but have found the dolphin to be very intuitive. The screen also rotates from landscape to horizontal which is nice to watch YouTube. Charging has taken 20-40 minutes each time.


On the whole, the BYD felt like a proper luxury car (think lexus) while the Tesla just felt very cheap and gimmicky. If we could get BYDs in CA, I’d buy one when I got back. The Dolphin plus is R$169k which is under $30k usd.


TLDR: the BYD dolphin is surprisingly nice and I want one.


Edit: I’m a California lawyer who is passionate about cars. My business / family fleet is currently:


Rx 350 f sport, Yukon Denali xl, 4Runner, forester xt, mazda 3, Corolla, a 2023 model y, and 2 Tesla model 3s (2019 and 2024).

Tesla’s sold over 1.8 million electric cars in 2023 alone, slashing emissions and making EVs legit—dude’s basically dragging us into a cleaner future. SpaceX? Reusable rockets, ISS missions, and a real shot at Mars. This isn’t sci-fi; it’s Musk making us a multi-planetary species. Neuralink’s pushing brain-tech boundaries, and The Boring Company’s tackling urban gridlock. Oh, and he quietly dropped $5.7 billion in Tesla shares for charity in 2021. Time made him Person of the Year for a reason.

So why the endless hate here? It’s the media—especially the leftist outlets like CNN and NYT—pushing this fake “salute” narrative to torch his rep. They’re obsessed with painting him as some alt-right villain, cherry-picking X drama (yeah, hate speech’s up 50% since he took over, per Berkeley) while ignoring the bigger picture. Why? Musk’s running Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, cutting through the fraud and waste that’s been lining their cronies’ pockets for years. That threatens their gravy train, so they’re desperate to take him down with any smear they can cook up.

He’s not perfect, but the guy’s doing more for us than the media will ever admit. Stop swallowing the narrative and give credit where it’s due.

What do you think—fair to say the media’s got an agenda here?

post,1jrj6vf,,Tariffs & Tesla- Will the hit affect sentiment around Tesla? And are you a goldfish?,"I posted something on another sub that one of members of this community suggested would be better received here. So, I decided to give it shot with this one. I get that this is ""TLDR"" for most people so if you are not into that, just move on. 

Obviously: Tariffs. Pain. Global pain. 

Here is a great interview with the well respected economist [David Rosenberg](https://www.rosenbergresearch.com/david-rosenberg/): [Economist David Rosenberg on Trump admin: ""These people don't understand what a tariff is](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/submit/)""

For those with short attention spans, here is the TLDW summary:

1. The Trump administration used 3-grade pumpkin math to determine what they are calling ""reciprocal tariffs"".
2. Side note- As an American and former ice hockey player that has spent time in Canada, I have to say- I friggin' love Canadian's humor. This guy starts out with a sarcastic jab of ""*somebody out there cracked the code*"". Blahaha! Sending good vibes to my friends up North. Keep your chins up friends. 
3. \*People have been ""numb"" to the nonsense coming out of the Trump administration and were ignoring it. Not anymore- This is key to the question I am about to postulate.\*  
4. The short-covering rally we just had was totally ignoring future uncertainty. More uncertainty was not priced in and that is what we just got. And surely, more uncertainty is coming. Hence the negative market reaction.
5. Uncertainty negatively affects expectations. And markets trade on expectations. Uncertainty alone can knock off 1-2% of GDP (which has been modeled and proven). This factor alone can lead to zero growth and drive us into a recession. 
6. Only ""sycophants"" (maybe we should just call then ""psychopants"" instead) think tariffs are going to work in the way they are being presented. They will surely be inflationary. Exporters do not pay tariffs, the importer does (us). 
7. Tariffs are not sustainable. Especially for America.",15659,True,1743791844.0,2025-04-04 20:37:24,0,1,iD-10T_usererror,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jrj6vf/tariffs_tesla_will_the_hit_affect_sentiment/,True,0.5,2025,both,search,False,False,0,
post,1jrqzht,,Rocket Lab (RKLB): A Promising Space Stock for the Post-Musk Era,"Elon Musk’s ventures have long dominated “space investing” conversations – but with Musk’s recent controversies and the fact that SpaceX isn’t publicly traded, investors are turning toward Rocket Lab as an attractive alternative. Rocket Lab (RKLB) is a \~$10–11B market cap space company that offers something SpaceX doesn’t: public market access to a growing space business, minus the Musk-related volatility. Let’s break down why RKLB might deserve a spot in a forward-looking portfolio:

* Robust Growth Trajectory: Rocket Lab’s financials showcase a company on the rise. 2024 revenues hit $436M (+78% YoY) , and Q4 alone grew 121% YoY. They’ve consistently increased launch count (16 launches in 2024 vs 10 in 2023) and expanded their Space Systems segment (which now brings in \~two-thirds of revenue via satellite manufacturing and components). Gross margins are improving (32% non-GAAP in 2024) , pointing to economies of scale. While the company is not net profitable yet (as it reinvests in growth), Wall Street expects continued top-line expansion and eventual operating leverage as larger projects come online .
* Catalysts on the Horizon: The big one is Neutron, Rocket Lab’s next-gen reusable rocket aimed at the medium-lift market. Management has scheduled the first launch for H2 2025 . This could be a game-changer – Neutron is designed to lift up to 13 tons to LEO , putting Rocket Lab in direct competition with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 for many satellite launch contracts.

post,1jtfari,,Congratulations if you shorted Tesla.,"Title pretty much says it. Tesla is down 12% in premarket trading today and already down over 50% from it's high in December.

Current P/E of 100+ is ridiculous and I personally think it should be worth less then 25$ a share. However, I have been following this stock and honestly: I never had the balls to short it. Seeing how irrational this stock behaved, and how many times short sellers got screwed. Never have I been more convinced a stock is incredibly overvalued though. but I admit I was too chicken.

I think the bubble has bursted and it wil keep dropping from where we are.  
Tesla is the main reason why I am not ""buying the dip"" with ETF's. It's my example/gauge of how the US stock market is still heavily overvalued right now.

post,1jtpf5k,,Will the sentiment around Trump & his tariffs affect Tesla’s stock specifically?,"\[Update\]: This got kicked by the Automods and I had a hard time getting it allowed. It’s a little stale now, especially with things changing so fast, but I would still like to have the conversation.

I posted something on another sub that one of members of this community suggested would be better received here. So, I decided to give it shot with this one. I get that this is ""TLDR"" for most people so if you are not into that, let me jump right to the question for you:

Will the negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's stock enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?

This guy starts out with a sarcastic jab of ""*somebody out there cracked the code*"". Blahaha! Sending good vibes to my friends up North. Keep your chins up friends.

post,1ju68ef,,How China’s Restrictions on Rare Earth Mineral Exports would Affect the EV Industry,"China’s restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, notably tightened as of April 4, 2025, are poised to significantly impact the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) industry. Rare earths like neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium are essential for the high-performance magnets in EV motors, while elements like lanthanum are used in batteries. China controls roughly 60-70% of global rare earth mining and nearly 90% of processing, giving it a chokehold on the supply chain that the U.S. EV sector heavily relies on.
The immediate effect is supply disruption. The U.S. imports about 74% of its rare earths from China (down from 80% a decade ago), and with export controls escalating—starting with gallium, germanium, and graphite in 2023 and expanding to other rare earths in 2024 and 2025—manufacturers like Tesla, General Motors, and Ford could face shortages. A single EV motor can require 1-2 kilograms of rare earth magnets, and with U.S. EV sales projected to hit 1.5-2 million units annually by 2030, the demand for these materials is massive. Without a steady supply, production lines could slow or halt, delaying deliveries and driving up costs.
Cost increases are already in motion. Post-restriction price spikes have historical precedent: in 2011, when China cut exports, rare earth prices soared—neodymium hit $67,000 per metric ton. Recent data shows neodymium at $75,097 per metric ton and dysprosium up 4.65% to $250.60 per kilogram as of late 2024, with analysts expecting further climbs in 2025 due to these bans. EVs already use six times more minerals than conventional cars, and with graphite (another restricted mineral) being the largest component in battery anodes (up to 136 pounds per EV), battery prices could jump 18% or more, pushing sticker prices higher and potentially slowing consumer adoption.
Geopolitical leverage amplifies the strain. China’s moves are a response to U.S.",3615,True,1744090345.0,2025-04-08 07:32:25,6,2,kmmeow1,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ju68ef/how_chinas_restrictions_on_rare_earth_mineral/,True,0.58,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1juwpro,,Crude oil an investment with price floor,"With most investments, they have an effective price floor of zero. 
Nvidia, Tesla, GM, BAC any company can go to zero over night but because of the intrinsic self balancing feature of oil price as controlled by OPEC and non-OPEC members. 

Crude oil has a price floor because the producers all have a breakeven price that if it goes under, they all start losing money so they reduce output and bring their price back up. 

For US shale producers in the Permian Basin, that's around $60bbl. For the UAE that's $59bbl. Qatar is $42. 

Right now WTI is at a 52 week low of $62. If it drops another $2 a lot of US producers are gonna start losing money. 

Even with the recession risk that'll drop demand, the suppliers will correspondingly drop supply to keep prices stable. 

As soon as the economy picks back up again, the crude oil price will increase.

My question is, does it make sense to dollar cost average out of the stock as well? For example, let’s say that I want to own 20k usd worth of Tesla.  If Tesla continues to rise so that I could sell a share and still have 20k would it make sense to do that and dollar cost average out?  In the same sense that Tesla goes down so I have less than 20k I would then purchase more shares to get my total value of Tesla stock up to $20,000?

At least one of them—if not all— is bound to be a 25-bagger over the next 5 years. You won’t get that from Apple or Alphabet!

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

…

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

post,1k8mm3o,,Sold all my Tesla shares before the crash. Here’s why I still think that was the right call (even at today's price),"A couple of months ago, prior to Tesla correcting by \~40% I no longer believed in the thesis of their stock valuation so I sold my entire holdings. Despite my continued admiration for Tesla’s tech, from an investment standpoint, I remain bearish—and it has little to do with the political horizon. Here’s why:

**Robotaxi: A Limited Revenue Catalyst**

Tesla plans to launch an unsupervised robotaxi service in Austin by mid-2025. However, even Tesla has admitted these vehicles will require human remote monitoring to ensure safety and regulatory compliance—a reality that adds cost and complexity.

The U.S. rideshare and taxi market today generates \~$52 billion annually, projected to grow to \~$61 billion by 2029. Capturing a meaningful slice of that pie won’t be easy:

* Waymo already operates fully autonomous fleets across Phoenix, San Francisco, LA, and Austin, and is expanding into Atlanta, Washington, Miami, and Tokyo.
* Pricing will be critical—and Tesla is playing catch-up technologically.

Even if Tesla somehow captured 25% of the entire U.S. market—a wildly optimistic scenario—it would generate \~$12 billion in revenue and $1–1.5 billion in profit over a decade or more.

More realistically, even under bullish forecasts, Tesla could earn \~$2 billion in revenue and \~$200 million in profit from robotaxis by 2029.

Compare that to Tesla’s current \~$80 billion revenue base.

It would move the needle by only a few percentage points—and that’s assuming everything goes perfectly.

Bottom line: this isn't a market-changing opportunity.

**Optimus: Exciting, But Decades Away From Prime Time**

Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot is expected to be priced around $20,000–$30,000. Elon Musk recently suggested a \~$30,000 target.

At that price, most consumers would expect meaningful labor-saving ROI within 3–5 years. Tasks like:

* Cooking
* Laundry
* Grocery management
* Lawn care and snow removal

post,1kaai3b,,Is PLTR or TSLA a Better Position for AI Growth???,"I want to increase AI exposure in my portoflio because I am really bullish on AI for the future. Im debating between PLTR and TSLA. I feel like TSLA has so much potential in the AI space with their fully autonomous taxi service that allows Tesla owners to make money with their cars, however, waymo is a strong competitor here. The other TSLA project im pretty bullish about is their AI robots. The ceo of Nvidia recently said that they believe autonomous robots are the next stage of the AI boom. I think there is a lot of potential here if companies can adopt them to save money with more manual work.

My biggest worry with Tesla is the controversy surrounding it. Tesla's name has been completely destroyed internationally. BYD was already beating them by a lot but now its going to be bad. I also am a bit worried that the CEO will continue to do more to destroy the Tesla name through other shocking actions.

post,1khk8sf,,"Google is at a 40 pe ratio, excluding the search revenue","Yes, this is another post about how cheap Google is.

Here’s the deal: Google’s net income for 2024 was $100 billion, with 55% of that coming from search.
With a $1.8 trillion market cap, Google would “only” need to have a PE ratio of 40—this is considering revenue only from its fast-growing segments like Cloud, YouTube, Waymo, etc.

To put it in context, here are a few companies with similar businesses and their high PE ratios:

Microsoft: 34
Netflix: 54
Tesla: 152
Palantir: 480
Google (excluding search): 40

This completely excludes the search business, as if it stopped generating any revenue overnight. That obviously won’t happen. Even if we see a slowdown in growth or a decline, search will still generate massive amounts of money, which can be used for significant buybacks—like those seen in the last quarter.

TL;DR: Google is basically a fast-growing company with a PE ratio of 40, plus a “dying” business that’s still going to generate around $50 billion annually for the next five years.

post,1kndhf3,,Is a new classifier needed for electrified CUVs? Here's how they differ in size from their ICE counterparts:,"From my quick look at 10 ICE models and 10 EV (plus Toyota Crown Signia) equivalents, the **electrified** counterparts are (on average) **2.4 inches lower, 2.9 inches longer, and 1.7 inches wider**. I included the Tesla Model Y and did the Mazda CX-5 as its ""ICE counterpart"".

  
These dimensions aren't hugely different on paper, but that's more height and width difference than the current Chevy Trailblazer/Equinox and more in all dimensions than Honda Pilot/Passport. It's a noticeable terms of style and presence. They're obviously more optimized for EV range, while also being in a familiar and friendly CUV shape that buyers are used to and comfortable with.

  
Should we start calling this class of vehicles EUVs or something? It seems like there are 1-2 new ones per year, and they continue to grow in popularity.

On June 19, only a very small number of so-called Cybercabs will be used on the road, and only by invitation, but NHTSA still thinks this is wrong. Musk has not responded to NHTSA yet. What kind of autonomous driving will the so-called Cybercab be and how will it be regulated? Of course, Musk's good friends in the White House may directly ask NHTSA to give up all questions about Musk.

Musk is unfortunate because all the liars have been exposed before him, and he has to face more stringent investor supervision. For example, the protagonist of ""Bad Blood"", a lady who doesn't blink, investors are fed up with boasting but not delivering, and Musk must deliver. But the problem is that once it is delivered, the lie will be exposed.

Without L4 autonomous driving and Robotaxi comparable to Waymo, everything about him is being sniped. Just like when Cybertruck was released, Tesla fans asked me, ""Look, the slap is so fast and strong, call us daddy. Musk is a god."" Because in the previous year, I have been saying that Cybertruck has no market at all, this is a vertical segment. The main scene of Truck is work, not play. And they think that everything I, a dull ITIL consultant and a third-rate business school auditor, say is ridiculous. But after I shouted daddy to everyone in the chat room and accepted their humiliation. In less than a year, Cybertruck sales collapsed. I want to find them on Twitter and let them prove that I am not wrong. But they all said to me, ""Do facts matter? We made money, hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock market returns. Hold on to your truth and go back to Australia. Loser."" Now the same is true for Cybercab. Musk made it, but no one will pay for it. He can't even catch up with ""WAYMO, the backward smart driving using lidar"". After all, Waymo is L4 autonomous driving, certified by NHTSA. And Musk is L2.

post,1kqs7zz,,Is this why markets have been not making sense?,"A lot of people have been stumped about why markets have not been making sense. Trump announced tarrifs will go down but tariffs still hurt the economy and somehow the market goes up. 1 country strikes a trade deal and market goes up. Tesla reported terrible earnings then stock goes up. Moody's downgrade of US rating, as well as the largest store in the USA says prices will increase because of tariffs and market finishes positive during the first trading day after the news. None of it makes sense. 

Smart investors are looking to make sense of a stock in order to determine a buy or a sell but literally everything seems unpredictable.. The resounding answer from the community seems to be ""the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent."" and all the other common phrases you hear here. But what if it is being rational? 

I've seen a lot of the blame placed on institutional investors trying to manipulate the market or they don't know what they're doing. ""There's a reason 86% of them don't beat the S&P."" But what if we have been placing blame on the wrong group? 

YTD institutions have taken more money out or bet against the market significantly more than they have put in. AKA, if they controlled the stock market like they used to, the market would be nearly as predictable as we are used to. 

What I think is not being accounted for is the exponential increase in retail investors. YTD retail investors have pumped the market with loads of cash and optimism. Retail has put in significantly more positive cash than institutions have negative. 

Maybe we need to think less about how the market has reacted in the past or what institutions think. But take more of a balanced approach, taking into consideration retail investors.

However I'm not sure from where we would draw this retail investment consideration? From what I see on social media people are afraid of prices going up, tariffs, keeping their jobs and affording life basics.",2293,True,1747702483.0,2025-05-20 02:54:43,180,212,CopsNroberts,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kqs7zz/is_this_why_markets_have_been_not_making_sense/,True,0.77,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1kr1vlf,,CATL goes public in Hong Kong Listing - climbs 16% in debut,"CATL is the world’s leading EV battery maker and a symbol of Chinese dominance in green energy manufacturing. It’s already very profitable. A company to watch closely as EV’s grow. 

From Bloomberg: Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. jumped in its Hong Kong trading debut after the Chinese battery giant wrapped up the world’s biggest listing this year by raising HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion) despite being blacklisted by the Pentagon and grinding through geopolitical storms.

Shares of CATL, as the largest maker of electric-vehicle batteries is known, climbed 16% to HK$306.20 on Tuesday. Though Hong Kong shares of Chinese companies typically trade at a discount to those in the mainland, CATL soared above its stock price in Shenzhen, where it rose 1.2%.

For investors, the allure of buying into a blue-chip stock at the forefront of electric-vehicle technology outweighed the risks of getting caught up in the ongoing turbulence in Sino-US relations. The success of the stock offering, which may increase to $5.3 billion if CATL exercises an option to do so, single-handedly doubled Hong Kong’s proceeds from listings this year and could embolden other companies to go public. 

CATL is “a true champion enabling the energy transition, a symbol of China’s success as a global green leader,” said Karine Hirn, a partner at East Capital Group. 

Priced at around 17 times current earnings multiples, CATL’s Hong Kong shares have room to rise 50%, driven by strong earnings and attractive valuations, said Johnson Wan, head of China industrials research at Jefferies in Hong Kong. 

CATL supplies batteries to top-tier customers such as Tesla Inc., Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co. and Mercedes-Benz Group AG. It has a market share of roughly 38% in electric-car batteries, comfortably ahead of its closest challenger, top EV maker BYD Co.’s 17%, according to SNE Research.

Musk’s comments come after some investors have questioned his dedication to Tesla.

He has been serving as a key advisor to President Donald Trump in leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which has been a major focus for the tech billionaire in recent months. The stock has had a volatile start to the year, and is down more than 12% year to date.

post,1kr9p3w,,U.S. stocks in modest pullback as brief market optimism may be overdone,"Just finished reading today's stock market quotes, and U.S. stocks are finally showing some signs of cooling off.



The S&P 500 and Nasdaq each fell about 0.4%, ending a six-day winning streak. The main reason for this is that everyone was too optimistic about cooling inflation and a temporary cease-fire between the U.S. and China on a tariff deal. Now it looks like that optimism is a bit untenable.



Home Depot earnings report came out, revenue is not bad but profit did not meet expectations, the stock price fluctuation. I'm not sure I buy the idea that prices won't go up. After all, even Walmart is saying they'll have to raise prices.



Tesla continues to surge, Musk said in Qatar, “unless I die”, or will continue to be CEO, the market ate this again.



Bitcoin is also up, breaking $105,000 on the back of stablecoin legislation that passed a hurdle in the Senate.



A lot of tech stocks hit record highs, like Netflix, Uber, Visa, but it kind of seems like they're overdrafting the future.



Jamie Dimon and a number of Fed officials are cautioning not to get too happy too soon, with a rate cut not due until September and trade uncertainty still lingering. You still have to be cautious about buying stocks now, and there could be a major pullback at the first sign of a market flap.

post,1krcrsh,,Tesla's New Self-Driving Ride-Hailing Service – A Game Changer?,"Hey everyone – just saw some big news. Elon Musk announced that Tesla (TSLA) is launching a self-driving ride-hailing service in Austin, TX. It’ll start with about 10 vehicles and scale up to 1,000 within a month. He also mentioned a goal of having 1 million fully autonomous vehicles in operation by the end of next year.

The service will be geo-fenced for safety and allow Tesla owners to rent out their autonomous cars, similar to Uber or Airbnb’s model.

TSLA stock jumped over 3.5% intraday on the news, while competitors like Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) dipped 1–2%, showing how seriously the market is taking Tesla’s expansion into ride-hailing.

If you believe in the long-term potential of autonomous mobility and tech disruption, this might be a major growth driver for TSLA. Definitely something to keep an eye on.

post,1krh3sj,,"Elon Musk says Tesla, xAI expect to keep buying chips from Nvidia and AMD","Elon Musk said Tuesday that he expects Tesla and xAI will continue buying chips from semiconductor giants Nvidia and AMD, and possibly others.

Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, which now owns X (formerly Twitter) has already installed 200,000 GPUs at its Colossus facility in Memphis, the Tesla CEO told CNBC’s David Faber on Tuesday. XAI is also planning a 1 million GPU facility outside of Memphis, Musk said. 

He did not specify how many chips the company had already ordered and by which date they may be installed.

“A few years ago, I made a very obvious prediction, which is that the limitation on AI will be chips,” he said.

Last year, Musk directed Nvidia to send a large order of GPUs to xAI first, jumping the line ahead of Tesla.

At his autos business, Musk said Tesla’s Dojo supercomputer in Buffalo, New York is already used for training its Autopilot and Optimus robotics systems.

Musk boasted on Tuesday that xAI’s Colossus is the “most powerful training cluster in the world right now” with “over 200,000 GPUs training coherently.” Musk’s choice to build in Memphis, Tennessee, was hailed by city officials as transforming the region into a “high-tech manufacturing hub.”

But local communities there have protested the power- and water-hungry operation, specifically the way that xAI has relied on natural gas-burning turbines to help power the supercomputer.

The turbines emit smog-forming nitrogen oxides (NOx), precursors to ozone formation, which have been associated with higher risk of death from respiratory disease.

As CNBC previously reported, environmental advocates say that xAI has likely “violated the Clean Air Act” and local permitting requirements for “major sources of air pollution” with its use of the turbines.

Musk said a Tesla robotaxi service will start with about 10 vehicles in Austin, and rapidly expand to thousands of vehicles should the launch go well with no incidents. To start, Tesla has said its robotaxis will be Model Y vehicles equipped with a forthcoming version of FSD, or full self-driving, known as FSD Unsupervised. Musk said Tesla “will geofence” its robotaxis in Austin to start, meaning the company will limit where those Model Y vehicles can drive. But there won’t be a human safety driver in the cars, Musk promised. Tesla employees will be remotely monitoring the fleet, he said.

post,1ksmqw7,,"Peugeot E-3008 - Review after 20,000km (12,500 miles)","**Dear fam,**

I'm living in Germany and picked up my Peugeot E-3008 (with the standard battery – 73.0 kWh net / 77.0 kWh full) back in January. I wanted to share some of my experiences so far after 20,000km. If you have any questions - feel free to ask.

For context, I previously drove mainly BMW and Audi, and I also have about two years of experience with a Tesla Model 3 LR, plus a few months each with a Polestar 2 and VW ID.4 – so those are the benchmarks I’m comparing this car to.

# Overall impression

A high-quality vehicle with an amazing interior and strong pricing, though it has some limitations when it comes to charging in winter.

# 💰 Price & Value

I don’t think many EVs can beat the price/performance ratio of this Peugeot.  
Mine is fully loaded: infotainment, panoramic roof, heated *and* cooled seats front & rear – all for just over €60K in Germany. The hardware quality is on par with VW and Polestar, slightly below Audi, but far above my 2021 Tesla Model 3.

# 🛋️ Interior

I really love it. Everything is super fast – no lag when opening maps or menus. The interface is intuitive, and shortcuts for common functions are easy to access. Took me maybe 5 minutes to get used to, and now I’m a fan. The adaptive cruise control is amazing and the best I have ever had in a car. The side assist is not ideal as the car drives slightly drunk from left to right.

# 🔊 Sound system

I love bass-heavy music – and this sound system is **insanely** loud. Honestly, you can’t even turn it all the way up unless you want your ears to bleed. The bass is punchy; Tesla probably had the stronger subwoofer, but this one comes very close – best I’ve had outside of that.

# ⚡ Charging Speed DC

I usually charge from 5% to 55% on road trips – it goes from \~170 kW down to 100 kW within \~15 minutes. The official 20%-80% in 29 minutes is doable – **in summer, with a warm battery**. Avoid fast-charging in winter with a cold battery – speeds drop significantly, just like with most EVs.",2910,True,1747907419.0,2025-05-22 11:50:19,42,39,OpenCouple1995,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1ksmqw7/peugeot_e3008_review_after_20000km_12500_miles/,True,0.91,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1ktfc9f,,"The Doha interview confirmed that car sales are still Tesla's anchor, and Musk is trying hard to blur this anchor.The crisis is coming quiet","The Doha interview confirmed that car sales are still Tesla's anchor, and Musk is trying hard to blur this anchor. He also hopes that investors will look to ten years later.

As an investor, it is very important to look forward to a better future, because this is the basic concept of investment. However, this does not mean that we only look at the future and not the fundamentals of a company, that is, the main business. Not to mention what if this so-called future is unreliable? This interview can confirm that Saudi investors are very dissatisfied with the sales of his cars, which is Musk's most hated topic. After all, he has said that he doesn't like the car business anymore, and he wants to make cooler Robotaxi, robots, and FSD. And these are all far away.

I know that many Tesla fans have been insisting on proving to everyone how great FSD is. But you know, although many people have shown that FSD can travel 300KM, even across the east and west of the United States without human intervention once. But on the NHTSA registration list, it is L2 autonomous driving. I even wonder why NHTSA allows FSD to be approved without holding the steering wheel. After all, it is only L2 instead of L3 or L4. Of course, this is not important. What is important is that the foundation of FSD today is not enough to support Robotaxi.

I have also met Tesla fans who told me, ""If FSD really doesn't work, at most we can add a lidar, which is not a difficult task."" When I used the logic of business school to analyze it for them, when lidar is added, the competitors will become WAYMO, and WAYMO has been leading for 5 years in using lidar and getting L4, so Tesla will have to catch up.

Tesla fans said contemptuously, ""So what, does WAYMO have a rocket? Can it take us to Mars?""

In the past, Musk could always say Next Year, but when Next Year has arrived, what should he do? Forever Mars plan?

India has electrified 99% of their railway network. It's 75% for china. 70% for France and Spain. 55% for Russia and Germany.

Then we come to electric bikes. They are selling a lot more than electric cars even in USA where there isn't any proper cycling infrastructure.

https://www.bicycling.com/news/a39838840/ebikes-are-outpacing-electric-car-sales-in-the-us/

Trolley buses have existed for decades in many cities. From Moscow to Mexico city.

Electrification of buses with batteries are also a lot more successful than cars.

https://www.sustainable-bus.com/news/bloomberg-new-energy-finance-long-term-forecast-on-electric-buses-vehicles/


 You can have buses with much smaller batteries and use opportunity charging as buses would wait sometimes in terminal any way. Also it's much easier to implement battery swapping for buses than cars. Also in motion charging with trolley bus wires too is possible.

Then we come to resource consumption for cars vs public transportation. Let's take battery needed for electrification. Shenzen has a 100% electric bus fleet. An electric bus would mostly have 500 kWh battery pack. This can be reduced below 100 kWh by opportunity charging (like pantograph charging or battery swapping). Let's be conservative and assume you need 500 kWh battery per bus. And there is one bus per 500 residents in Shenzen. So it comes down to only 625 Wh/person. If they owned cars they would need atleast 15,000 Wh/person assuming one car with 60 kWh battery per a family of 4. This can go upto 60,000 Wh/person or even higher if there's one car per person.

You can also use trolley buses for very busy bus routes. Which would only need a very small battery.

As someone who has lost a significant amount of money shorting Tesla, I'd like to share my thoughts.

**Stage 1: Inception**

> TL;DR: Elon and Tesla capitalized on three key movements: the green movement, cultural status, and visionary leadership of the third industrial revolution.

To understand Tesla today, we need to look back 20 years. Tesla should never have succeeded. There has not been a new car company to sell over 9,000 cars (the DeLorean) in over 100 years before Tesla. Tesla's founders aimed to transform the world by developing an electric vehicle to propel the world toward a green future. Looking for new investments with his PayPal winnings, Elon joined the Tesla team. The founders had a vision and direction, but over time, Elon pushed for continually expanding changes and leveraged his funding and chairman status to execute a Coup d'état to become CEO.

To Elon's credit, it worked. The Roadster was a wild success. Elon leveraged this momentum to convince governments to create billions in long-term subsidies, which enabled them to establish a legitimate foundation as both an industrial power and a strong brand among those invested in the green revolution. He also leveraged this momentum to establish a powerful following of loyal customers who shared his mission and to attract top talent seeking a brighter future.

This also created a flywheel of success: Elon leverages his status to market a new revolutionary dream -> people believe him because of his previous success and the desire for it to be true -> personal or government funding is generated that drives this dream -> Elon forces through objections and doubt -> the dream is partially implemented -> Elon's status as a visionary leader is enhanced.",10221,True,1748006096.0,2025-05-23 15:14:56,32,25,Epicism,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ktjam4/tesla_vision_volatility_and_the_illusion_of/,True,0.74,2025,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1kum63j,,How bad can it get when crypto goes POOF?,"Right now there is about 3 trillion market cap in crypto, which is making a lot of people feel significantly richer than they are. supposing crypto market cap goes to near zero, I do not think there has ever been a wealth destruction event like that ever in the history of markets. I think it could have significant impacts on the global economy, causing a very real financial crisis.

AI is probably in a bubble as well, there are very obvious stocks at the very least which are beyond reason, such as tesla and Palantir.

These seem to be a staple in the modern portfolio, and could contribute to an even greater loss of the wealth effect.

the wealth effect would further deteriorate as multiple compression occurs across the board in a bear market.

A lot of people will probably pile on here saying that crypto wont go to zero, but factually there is only one use for blockchain technology right now and that would be a CBDC. CBDC would not have anything to do with the current coins which are being treated as ponzi schemes, and would not be related to the likes of tether or USDC. As matter of fact tether and USDC would likely stop existing as liquidity for them would dry up in an event where there is no coins to gamble on outside of them.

Is the next great financial crisis going to play out something like this? and when will it occur? Historically in great bubbles they were nearing an end when political figures were stoking the fire for personal gain. It is not hard to see this playing out right now. A lot of people find comfort that there is greater acceptance of crypto, but in fact it is a sign that the party is nearing its end. History rhymes.

EDIT: I have responded a lot in here, I think that I have clarified a few things with people and would like to change my wording above.

* Nvidia's scheduled earnings Wednesday highlight the tech financial reports calendar this week, along with quarterly updates from Salesforce, Marvell Technologies, Dell, and HP. Other noteworthy reports expected include retailers Costco, AutoZone, and Dick’s Sporting Goods.
* Friday’s PCE inflation report will provide insight into price pressure in April, while investors will also be following updates to first-quarter GDP, the U.S. trade balance, and consumer confidence.
* Federal Reserve officials set to speak this week include Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller and New York Fed President John Williams, coming as the Fed is scheduled to release the minutes from its May meeting.

Nvidia (NVDA) earnings and a key inflation report highlight this week’s holiday-shortened calendar as investors continue to evaluate the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and economic policies.

Tech companies Salesforce (CRM), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Dell Technologies (DELL), and HP (HPQ) are expected to deliver earnings this week. Market watchers will also be looking for reports from retailers Costco Wholesale (COST), AutoZone (AZO), Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS), and Temu parent PDD Holdings (PDD).

The reports are set to arrive after a down week for stocks, which was punctuated Friday by a revival of trade-related uncertainty. You can recap last week's trading here.

In addition to Friday's personal consumption expenditures inflation report on Friday, investors will also be tuned into first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) updates and the latest data on the U.S. trade balance and retail inventories. Consumer confidence and sentiment surveys also will be in focus.

Several Fed officials are on the speaking calendar, including Federal Reserve Gov.",7347,True,1748178984.0,2025-05-25 15:16:24,67,4,callsonreddit,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kv2as8/what_to_expect_in_the_markets_this_week_may_2730/,True,0.91,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1kv2htl,,Elon says he's back to work 24/7; bullish on TSLA,"So obviously after Elon hurt his reputation/brand after extremely unpopular political activities, it took a major outage at X dot com to result in this:

> “Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms,” Musk wrote in a post on X on Saturday replying to news of outages on the platform. “I must be super focused on X/xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.”

For me this is extremely bullish as his involvement with TSLA was the main driver for its success & stock price. 

Having Elon back to work at Tesla is going to get those products out the door, especially robi taxi & those dancing robots.. I know it sounds comical but I see 100s of millions of people buying these robots.

Yeah, Tesla’s talking a big game with Full Self-Driving, robotaxis, and household robots. Cool stuff, but it's all *future*. Meanwhile, their core EV business? Slipping. Q1 deliveries were the worst in over two years (337k), and they’re losing global market share. Stock's riding on promises

Then there’s BYD. Not as flashy, but they’re dominating China 34% of the NEV market in 2024, $107B in revenue (more than Tesla!), and some insane charging tech (250 miles in 5 minutes?!). Plus, their cars are affordable. Under $10K for an EV? That’s game-changing

Sure, BYD isn’t as far along with FSD, but they’re investing $14B into making smarter cars. And the stock’s trading at a sane valuation (under 27x earnings). Tesla? Still moon-high

post,1kw2152,,"Data after 50,000+ miles across a Bolt EUV and a Tesla Model 3","I have a separate meter for my 2023 Tesla Model 3 RWD that I use to track energy use, efficiency, cost (and cost-savings), etc., and compare back to very detailed data I kept on my previous ICE car. 

Given I've now driven >30,000 miles, it felt like a good time to share the data and because I had it, I also shared comparisons to the Bolt EUV. 

|Measure|2023 Tesla Model 3 RWD|2022 Bolt EUV FWD|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Miles**|30,499|19,912|
|**Total kWh**|9,028|6,547|
|**Wh/Mi; Mi/kWh; MPGe**|296; 3.38; 114|329; 3.04; 103|
|**Average Temp**|49F|52F|
|**Savings ; Tax**\*\*\*|$2,076.44; $437.37|$1,454.89; $279.50|

**SAVINGS**  
*\*I benchmarked the fuel costs associated against my prior car, a Toyota Corolla which got 33.17 mpg over the 100,000+ miles I tracked it, and I also benchmarked against current gas prices, which in my area have been roughly $3/gallon but I am using nuanced* [*monthly averages for my state*](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM_EPMRU_PTE_NUS_DPG&f=W)*. I also bake in a $30 oil change per 5,000 miles as ""fuel"".* 

*\*\*I also calculated the portion of my savings that is due to taxes I'm not paying at the pump (0.285+0.184 per gallon) - which is relevant politically given we can expect a $250/year EV surcharge to attempt to ""close that loophole"", which for me, looks to be ""fair"" if it were state + federal, but just being federal and* combine*d with my state's surcharge ($75), it is not.* 

I have insurance, tabs, depreciation, maintenance, as well but wanted to focus on ""fuel"". Those costs are all higher than the Corolla due to the Tesla (and Bolt) being much newer cars (and fully insured instead of minimally insured) and the heightened costs do offset the fuel-savings for now. I'll be curious to see over 100,000+ miles how the total cost to own tightens up and I expect the Tesla to win out.

post,1kwjdmm,,TSLA: Why I'm still bullish despite the EPS nosedive,"Been holding TSLA since 2021 and just watched their recent earnings with mixed feelings. While everyone's freaking out about the 53% EPS drop, I've been trying to make sense of why the stock is still up 37% over the same period. Either I'm missing something or the market is.

My position: 120 shares @ $187 average (up about 81% total)

The Q1 earnings were objectively bad

EPS of $0.27 vs expected $0.41 (missed by 34%)

Factory changeovers for Model Y killed production numbers

Automotive margins down to 19% from previous highs in the mid-20s

Musk sounding increasingly distracted on the call

Yet I'm still holding and even added 15 shares on the post-earnings dip. Here's why:

The energy business is quietly becoming a monster

While everyone obsesses over car deliveries, Tesla's energy storage business hit record gross profit with 26% margins. My brother works in commercial solar, and he says Megapack orders are backlogged for months. The margins here are substantially better than automotive, and it's growing faster.

The robotaxi bet could pay off big

I was skeptical about the robotaxi timeline until I saw the Austin test videos. If they actually launch paid rides next month as planned, it changes everything about the valuation model. Even if it's limited geographically, proving the technology works would be massive.

Optimus robot could be the sleeper hit

The Optimus humanoid robot is another wild card that could transform Tesla's business model. They're planning to have thousands of units in production by year-end, ramping to potentially a million units annually by 2030. Imagine having one of these handling household chores, elder care, or factory work.

post,1kwrt8l,,New 3-row EV comparison,"Below is the summary by Google NotebookLM

* **Kia EV9**
   * **Price:** Starts at $54,900, or basically $55,000, making it the cheapest and best value vehicle in the three-row segment. The as-tested price of the specific model shown was just over $70,000, around $72,000. You can get the Land trim with a large battery pack and dual motor for this price. Leasing is also mentioned as very cheap, around $299 per month with about $2500 down (taxes included in Colorado).
   * **Range:** The video mentions the EPA rated range is put up. The large battery pack is almost 100 kilowatt hours. The range is described as ""not all that much,"" just under 100 kilowatt hours, but considered an ""easy justification"" for the price.
   * **Charging Performance:** Charging performance is noted as being good due to its EGMP platform. The peak charging speed is about 220 kW briefly, but most of the time it's about 200 kW, and it holds this speed deep into the pack, sitting at just about 200 kW up to 80%. This makes it an amazing charging vehicle for road trips. However, it's the only vehicle in the comparison that doesn't natively interface well with the Tesla Supercharger network, getting a maximum of 84 kW currently, though this is expected to increase to 125 kW for model year 2026. It uses an onboard booster for Supercharging and can be buggy.
* **Cadillac Vistic**
   * **Price:** Described as ""quite a bit more money than the Kia,"" starting around $80,000 base, with the as-tested model around $84,000. Higher trims can go up to $100,000.
   * **Range:** Shares the Lyric battery, which GM quotes as 102 kilowatt hours capacity, though it's closer to 105-106 kWh. The battery capacity is only about 10 to 20 kWh more than the smaller Equinox and Optic, which feels like a lot of money for the battery size in a large car.

I was really excited about the ID Buzz but I’ve realized it’s a failure in the US. Tried to capture why I think it’s failing - can informed folks please weigh in. 

1. Price. The higher trims hit mid $70K and there are just fewer customers in this segment (irrespective of brand, range etc). 
2. Range. For a car starting mid $60Ks, a range of 230 miles is just not acceptable. It’s off by a 100 miles actually. 
3. No incentives. Since this isn’t made in the U.S. Also no special lease deals in the U.S.  
4. Minivans are just not popular, especially compared to SUVs. Doesn’t matter how novel it looks. 
5. Marketing. Unfortunately, there is almost no effective marketing campaigns to promote the vehicle.

post,1kxu7oq,,First-Time EV Buyer's Guide,"I often help people on the weekly General Questions and Purchasing Advice thread, and have been thinking about doing something like this to compile my answers to common questions. I'm going to structure it like a guide for each part of the buying process, but it's more like a collection of my thoughts. I'd be happy to add to it if anyone has anything else to contribute! This is also US-centric (sorry). 

#The Starting Line
So you want to buy an EV eh? Awesome! The process is, in general, very similar to buying a standard internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, but with a few key additional areas of research. I'm going to assume you generally know the basics of ICE vehicle ownership, and make this guide as specific as possible the electric portion of the vehicle purchasing. 

Let me say this up top though if you are on the fence for an EV. If you can charge at home and have a two-car (or more) household, you 100% should make one of those cars an EV. You'll save money on gas and oil changes, and experience the convenience of leaving home with a full ""tank"" every morning. You can get a used Chevy Bolt or Tesla for less than $10k almost anywhere in the US if you qualify for the $4k tax credit, and they're great vehicles that can completely cover 99% of driving needs (and obviously there's plenty of vehicles at higher prices). If that's all you need to hear, go for it. 

# Assess your situation
As always you should buy a car that suits your needs. Trucks for construction work, vans for families, etc. EVs are no different, but you should ask yourself a few additional questions to determine which, if any, EV is right for you: 

* The first, most important question - do you have a place to charge? The main benefit EV owners cite is that the vehicle can ""refuel"" at home, every night. In contrast, the ""worst"" part of the experience is public charging.",15761,True,1748470421.0,2025-05-29 00:13:41,86,53,chilidoggo,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kxu7oq/firsttime_ev_buyers_guide/,True,0.95,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1kxwjdj,,Tesla investors demand Musk work 40-hour week at EV maker as ‘crisis’ builds,"Elon Musk needs to spend more time at Tesla as his electric vehicle company faces a “crisis,” according to a letter on Wednesday from a group of pension fund leaders who manage investments in the company.

“Tesla’s stock price volatility, declining sales, as well as disconcerting reports regarding the company’s human rights practices, and a plummeting global reputation are cause for serious concern,” the investors wrote in a letter to Robyn Denholm, the company’s board chair. “Moreover, many issues are linked to Mr. Musk’s actions outside of his role as Technoking and Chief Executive Officer at Tesla, including his high-profile role as an architect of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).”

The investors want the Tesla board to require Musk to work a minimum of 40 hours per week at the automaker as a condition of any new compensation plan they may arrange for him. They also want a clear succession plan for management of the EV business, and a policy that would apply to all Tesla directors limiting their outside board commitments at public and private companies.

Early last year, the Delaware Court of Chancery ordered Tesla to rescind Musk’s 2018 CEO pay package, which had been worth around $56 billion, finding that Musk controlled the company, and the board’s compensation committee misled shareholders before seeking their vote to approve the plan.

Musk now says he wants even more shares, amounting to 25% voting control of the company.

Tesla’s brand value and reputation have declined since 2024, due largely to Musk’s incendiary rhetoric and political activities. In addition to pouring nearly $300 million into an effort to get Donald Trump back into the White House, Musk formally endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party ahead of the country’s parliamentary election this year.

At DOGE, Musk has led an initiative by the Trump administration to slash federal agencies.",3951,True,1748476658.0,2025-05-29 01:57:38,313,51,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kxwjdj/tesla_investors_demand_musk_work_40hour_week_at/,True,0.94,2025,both,search,False,False,0,

I have a 26 Juniper and 21 Bolt. Obviously, different connectors for charging with NACS and J1772. 

I moved recently and to have a new plug installed outside with my Grizzl-E’s NEMA 14-50 is not recommended without a GCFI breaker. I have decided to sell the Grizzl-E and purchase a Tesla wall connector. 

I regularly charge my Bolt at Superchargers with a A2Z EV CCS1 to NACS connector and also own a A2Z EV NACS to J1772 connector. 

Which way do you think I should go?

1. Tesla Wall Connector with NACS only and then use the A2Z adapter with the Bolt. 
2. Tesla Universal Wall Connector with NACS and J1772. 

Cost difference is $420 vs $650.

post,1kyl4rv,,Question about Tesla Cars,"Hello,

I’d like to start this off by saying that I have this problem where people keep hitting my car. Doesn’t matter if I’m stopped at a red light or just driving in my own lane. Somehow, people keep hitting me. I haven’t been at fault for any of these incidents so far. I’m pretty fed up with this because I’ve had my car for less than one year and it has been hit three times. I don’t even live in a big city. 

So, my question is: will a Tesla alert me if another car makes contact with mine, even if it’s just a really small bump? 

In one of the incidents I had, I was on a busy highway, stopped at a red light. I noticed the person behind me was super close to me but my car didn’t move and I didn’t hear a sound (my window was down) so I drove off. Later I checked and there was a dent in my car where the person hit me.

Do you guys think a Tesla would “help” me with this issue? I just want it to alert me even if the other car barely touched mine.

post,1kyld3i,,New vehicle purchase - check my gas/kWh math please,"TLDR: upgrading from a 35mpg (city) 2nd gen Prius to PHEV or EV, think either one will save us in the long run as gasoline costs increase here in California, but based on my math it is not looking feasible. I need some input if my math needs to account for other factors. 

For context, my wife has a 2007 Prius that's reliable but showing its age. Haven't done much highway driving lately but have been tracking the last few fuel purchases of mostly city driving and it seems to be getting about 35mpg lately. Regular 87 octane is holding at around $4/gallon. So approx 11.4 cents per mile for fuel only (not including maintenance, etc).
Central Valley CA. We are expected to see gas in the $6-8 range within the next 2 years due to refineries shutting down permanently, unless there is some course correction with the political winds.

Our goal in a new vehicle is to upgrade from what we currently have and have a vehicle that is good for long trips. We think PHEV is the ideal candidate. It would allow efficient daily commute use, but still have the engine and tank to take us anywhere on longer trips like we currently use her car or my truck (400-500 mile range) without having to deal with the range anxiety or charging times of a full EV. 

I'm learning to look past the MPGe number and look more closely at the specs, since MPGe is an average formula based on average driver use case scenario. 
Learning to ask: what is the MPG of the gas powertrain that will take us on longer trips, and what is the kWh/100 mile number.

Example a new Kia Sorento or Sportage PHEV have 31/34 miles of EV range respectively, and approx 34-36mpg gas, but a Mazda CX90 has 26 miles of battery range and only gets 26mpg gas. These are just a few PHEV models we have considered. 
Digging deeper, the kWh/100 mile ratings:
Kia Sportage PHEV 40
Kia Sorento PHEV 45
Mazda CX-90 PHEV 58

We do not currently have solar, it is in the future plans, so for now just paying straight PG&E rates on a tiered rate plan.",3710,True,1748550691.0,2025-05-29 22:31:31,3,60,keepcalmandcarryone,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kyld3i/new_vehicle_purchase_check_my_gaskwh_math_please/,True,0.59,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1kylja5,,"⚡ PSA: Can’t Adjust Your Tesla Wall Connector Settings Anymore? Here's How To Fix It (Gen 3, 2025 Method)","**TL;DR:**  
Tesla seems to have quietly killed the web setup process for Wall Connectors. If you're stuck with the “Download the Tesla One App” message at [192.168.92.1](http://192.168.92.1), stop wasting time. Download the *Tesla One* app, select “External Partner,” enter your Wall Connector serial manually, and use Setup Mode (blinking green) to reconfigure your unit.

\--

Alright Reddit — if you’re trying to reconfigure your Gen 3 Tesla Wall Connector (like resetting it or changing the breaker size), and all you’re getting is the “Tesla One App – Partner Access Only” screen at [`http://192.168.92.1`](http://192.168.92.1), here’s what actually worked for me after way too much trial and error. Tesla has changed how commissioning works, and most of the info online is now outdated.

# What You’ll Need:

* Tesla One App (not the regular Tesla app)
* Wall Connector serial number (usually on the back of the unit, behind the cover)
* A Tesla account (yes, even if you don’t own a Tesla)
* Your Wi-Fi password
* A little patience

# Steps to Reset or Recommission:

1. Download the **Tesla One App**
2. Choose **External Partner** when prompted
3. Log in or create a Tesla account
4. Tap: *Installs → Continue → Go to Home*
5. Tap **Begin Install**
6. Choose **Enter Connector Info Manually**
7. Type in your unit’s serial number
8. Put your Wall Connector into setup mode by holding the charging handle button for \~6 seconds until the LED blinks green
9. Tap **Join** when prompted
10. Follow the rest of the prompts:

* Set country
* Adjust breaker size (e.g., 50A sets output to 40A)
* Connect to Wi-Fi

# Quick Note:

I’m not an electrician — just a guy trying not to burn down the garage. My setup was wired to code for a 60A breaker, pulling 48A no problem. But during the county inspection, the inspector flagged it and made us swap to a 50A breaker due to some old local rule about cable length and attic heat.",2283,True,1748551103.0,2025-05-29 22:38:23,29,18,Temporary_Spinach_74,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kylja5/psa_cant_adjust_your_tesla_wall_connector/,True,0.81,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1kymcns,,I tried Tesla's 48 hour test drive...,"I am honestly speechless. My entire world has been rocked. The model Y is a great car, but I had no idea FSD was this good. I sat there nervously with my hands hovering over the steering wheel, waiting for it to jerk into a cyclist, veer into oncoming traffic, or make one of those random meme mistakes you see in YouTube videos, or read about from Twitter critics.

But it never happened. For three hours straight, it negotiated its way through city streets, highways, and narrow roads in the most shockingly natural and peaceful way possible. It was so good that I actually found myself kind of bored with the experience. 

I never considered myself a Tesla hater, but after years of hearing ""FSD will be solved this year"", I have to admit that my skepticism was at an all time high. but after this, I genuinely have to reorganize my decision making with regards to future car purchases because I don't see how it's possible to buy anything else.

post,1kyrdrn,,Thinking of buying a used Tesla — need input from long-time owners,"I recently test drove a few Teslas and instantly fell in love. Like many others have said, it completely changes how you view driving.

As much as I’d love to get a brand-new model (especially after experiencing HW4), my current financial situation only allows me to consider something from around 2018–2022 — ideally a 2019 or 2020 model.

So I have a few questions for those of you who own older Teslas:
	1.	Do you regularly use FSD (Full Self-Driving), or is it not really up to par with HW4, making you take over more often?
	2.	How many miles do you have on your car?
	3.	Is the claim that Tesla batteries can last up to 500k miles actually holding up for anyone here?

I know jumping into this might seem impulsive, but the experience genuinely changed my perspective — and the money saved on gas and oil changes is very appealing.

Do you think it’s too early for me to switch now, or should I just wait until I can comfortably afford a new model in 1–2 years?
