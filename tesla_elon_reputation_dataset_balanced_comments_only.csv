comment,5oshks,5oshks,,"Northern Graphite - NGPHF 

Pure Energy Minerals (Lithium) - PEMIF 

E-cobalt - ECSIF 

These are the most promising cobalt, graphite and lithium junior mining companies in my opinion. See below for a previous post of mine:

Currently 70 to 80% of the world’s graphite is mined in China. The mines are getting very deep and depleted. Production around the world needs to increase to keep up with the demand. If you do the math: There is up to 70 Kgs of graphite in an electric vehicle. That means 100,000 tonnes of graphite is needed for every million EVs (which is 1.5% of the car market). Research shows that if the EV market reached 5% of all vehicles, graphite production would need to double. North America needs to start producing electric vehicle quality spherical graphite to keep up with these predictions.

Lithium is experiencing a similar strain. Demand is expected to be as high as 125% of supply by 2020 due to electric vehicles and grid storage. The price of lithium has increased by 300% since 2003. When it comes to electric vehicles the quality of the lithium is crucial. Pure Energy Minerals has developed an extracting method that results in 90% pure lithium compared to the 30% standard and does it in a fraction of the time. Due to this high purity they have signed a 5 year deal with Tesla.

Last but not least, cobalt.

> We’ve developed a supercharger utilizing shaft power from an electric motor capable of delivering a static pressure of at least 5-7 pounds of boost

* Can you please advise what you mean by 'static pressure'? If that's literally what the system will produce in a closed system (Which looks like the case in the video) then it will be very different on an engine. Which leads to my next question...
* What capacity engine do you see this producing 5-7psi on?
* What RPM is this pressure at? As you'd know, maintaining 7psi at 2000rpm is VERY different from 7psi at 6000rpm and the normal question is, if you can do 7psi at 6000rpm, why aren't you doing say 14psi at 2000rpm.
* The above 2 questions can possibly be answered with a single one... How much volume is the system flowing?
* What motor you're using? Most centrifugal type blowers use **at least** 30hp to run, and even that's on the low side. How does your 7hp motor compare?

Maybe we'll see an evolution of this, where people on long road trips can go to one of the battery swap stations if it would save time and get a fully recharged battery in minutes. That is, of course, if we don't solve this problem in the way we currently are, by quick charging.

To expand my view about this though none of these options would be ideal in my opinion which is why I'm hoping hydrogen fuel cell cars take off. 5 minutes to a 300-400 mile range is better than any of the pure electrical charging options.

The things that will have the largest impact on TSLA stock:

1. Model 3 - whether or not it will launch and deliver to customers on time

2. US economy - the US economy is growing steadily - this is a big positive for auto sales

3. Tesla Energy - I easily see this as being a huge profit-making opportunity to Tesla and it seems to tick all the boxes. Efficiency and scale is everything here. No company can compete here. 

However, it's not just their Solar Roofs or Powerwall business, it's also their Electric Vehicles (EV) business.

However, the fact of the matter is that none of these companies produce Lithium Ion batteries and most of them are sourced from Samsung SDI, LG Chem and Chinese battery suppliers.

comment,631nux,631nux,,"You can argue it either way.  Obviously Tesla doesn't turn a net profit, but that's not really the argument here.  Ignoring the really stupid and blatantly false arguments (Tesla has negative gross margins, Tesla has the highest gross margins ever, etc.), it basically comes down to what you consider ""losing money"" on each car.

The ""no"" argument is pretty simple: Tesla has ~23% gross margins overall, and ~0.5% higher gross margins on their cars.  That includes parts, labor, manufacturing overhead, shipping, electricity and whatnot for Superchargers, and warranty reserve.  So to build the car, ship it, and warranty it, Tesla is not losing money on each car.

The ""yes"" argument is a bit more complex, but basically comes down to the fact that Tesla has negative operating margins.   That includes CoR but also includes SG&A and R&D, so cost of keeping stores/service centers open, sales costs, marketing expenses, IT, legal expenses, HR, etc, as well as R&D costs (self-explanatory).  So if you include all the costs associated with developing and selling the car (which is common practice in the industry) and cost of the company as a whole actually existing, they do lose money on each car sold.

The obvious counterargument is that R&D and whatnot are artificially inflated because of the Model 3 ramp, but even if you take out all Model 3-related expenses, Tesla's operating margins are still very very slim or negative.",1910,True,1491173278.0,2017-04-03 00:47:58,18,0,jetshockeyfan,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/631nux/q1_2017_deliveries/dfqunx1/,True,,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,dfqunx1

With no incentives or subsidies, or tax breaks, or laws being passed.

It's the natural order of technological progress, to leave inefficient technology behind. The profit motive will save the planet without a politician ever having to do anything.

hybrids are pretty terrible imo, you get all the downsides with a ice car, maintenance, engine wear, transmission fluid changes, oil changes, all the space the engine- exhaust-transmission take up, all the same parts that wear out, and don't get the positives electric has which is generally safety, less maintenance, recharge at home, high instant torque, more room etc.


All these companies are missing the mark- fully electric + over 200 mile range.

comment,65vp74,65vp74,,"Here are your problems:

You assume a gross margin of 20% for a mass market car. Honda/Toyota/GM are around 5%, I believe. Tesla won't be better.

Your growth assumptions are waaaaay to fast. No possible way that Model III sells 270k next year, or 30k for this year. Even the most bullish analysts only have like 2k Model III for this year.

You assume 25% GM on grid storage, which is currently negative.

Solar Roofs will not be a $36B market. I doubt there's even that much market for high-end roofs period in the USA. Solar roofs are not comparable to regular roofs, only very expensive slate/Tuscan/what-have-you tile..

No one will buy a Tesla pick-up. The market isn't there. Towing capacity is important for pick-ups (that's what they're for), and towing anything with the Model X drastically decreases range (to about a third or so). No way anyone will try anything with an EV pick-up, like taking a boat to the lake. Simply won't have the energy to make it there and back, unless you're talking a lake ~ 30 mins away.

I think the rest of your projections are WAY too rosy, but those are the few that are indisputably true.

comment,67dmwy,67dmwy,,"The piece of the puzzle you are missing out about the tech giants is their habits of buying out all the latest trending techs which allows them to continue to grow. And it is at a level that just isn't true for other sectors.

Facebook the website isn't what it used to be but instagram is as big as ever, guess who owns it? Whatsapp is another one they own which took over the text/msging industry. Then Oculus Rift (which at one point was THE virtual reality product) is also owned by Facebook. This trend will always continue with tech, tech industry is well aware of how new tech will make their old tech obsolete (they have witnessed it in action in the 90s/early 2000s). So much so that it is imperative that they change with the time.

Thus we cant treat Tech companies as this one single product selling entity anymore because they always acquire companies (that might not even reflect the initial businesses, i.e. virtual reality in Facebook's case or MSFT owning linkedin)

If not that, then they simply venture out on their own to create new businesses. (i.e Microsoft/Sony making a gaming console. Tesla that was initially a car company is now making solar panels for homes, or my favourite, amazon a distribution company venturing out and making one of the most successful cloud tech, AWS). This makes all of these tech giants of today different from the previous ones like AOL/MySpace who didn't do this.

comment,6a0nuw,6a0nuw,,"You've got plenty of time.  AAPL is a perfect example...the first iPhone came out in June 2007, and the stock was under $120.  By 2012, it was over $700.  Today, the pre-7:1 split equivalent share price is approaching $1,100 each.  So of course, the guy who got in @$500 didn't profit as much as the guy who got in at $200, but even the guy who got in at the then All Time High of $700 has still profited handsomely.

If you like TSLA and believe in its long to super-long term future (like me), get in. When this thing is trading at $500+, you won't care whether you got it @ $287 or $313.  But it is expensive, so unless you're throwing mega cash and buying 1000 shares, your actual dollar profit will probably take a little while to accumulate.  And I would say the 100+% gain in the last 12 months is not likely to occur again.  But that's ludicrous, that will be studied for years to come.

So if you want in for the long haul, watch the stock and wait for a little pullback.  It can't go up every single day, just try to find a deal to make yourself feel good about your investment, and lock it in a time capsule and come back and check on it in 10 years.

If you just want action, try TSLA options if you're up to it.  I've done very well on certain moves, very poor on others.  But it's highly volatile and is a polarizing company, which means people love it or hate it and the stock price moves wildly.

comment,6g8fje,6g8fje,,"Bullshit.

The math doesn't work. This isn't really feasible except for very lightly used superchargers. It depends on where you are and how well it is oriented, but a solar panel will get about 1kWh per day average across the year. And the panel is about 1.5 square meters. So that's 0.66 kWh per square meter.

A Tesla might take about 60kWh per charge. This is about 3/4 of the full capacity of the car. That means to charge one car per day takes 90 square meters of panels. And that's with 100% conversion efficiency.

If you you have 5 stalls and they each charge 4 cars a day, that's 1800 square meters of panels, almost 2 square kilometers [edit: it isn't 2 square kilometers, see respondents below].

And this is all being somewhat optimistic. It doesn't account for conversion losses (the charger really would be about 93% efficient, not 100). It doesn't account for cloudy days. It doesn't account for the fact that in winter the cells don't produce as much as average so you need even more of them.

It's just not realistic for 'almost all' Superchargers to disconnect from the grid and go solar+battery. Sure, you can do it with lightly used ones in open spaces where you can get space to install a lot of panels. But almost all is not just a pipe dream, it's an out and out lie.

Isambard Kingdom Brunel FRS (/ˈɪzəmˌbɑːd bruːˈnɛl/; 9 April 1806 – 15 September 1859), was an English mechanical and civil engineer who is considered ""one of the most ingenious and prolific figures in engineering history"", ""one of the 19th century engineering giants"", and ""one of the greatest figures of the Industrial Revolution, [who] changed the face of the English landscape with his groundbreaking designs and ingenious constructions"". Brunel built dockyards, the Great Western Railway, a series of steamships including the first propeller-driven transatlantic steamship, and numerous important bridges and tunnels. His designs revolutionised public transport and modern engineering.

Though Brunel's projects were not always successful, they often contained innovative solutions to long-standing engineering problems. During his career, Brunel achieved many engineering firsts, including assisting in the building of the first tunnel under a navigable river and development of SS Great Britain, the first propeller-driven, ocean-going, iron ship, which, when built in 1843, was the largest ship ever built.

* Tesla's customer service sucks. They are so behind on production people who get into accidents have to wait months to get parts to fix their cars. This will be a huge turn off for the average person and will be a problem GM won't have.

comment,6lk733,6lk733,,"I mentioned this in another post, but Tesla's tough to figure out, buy or short. Too many unknowns for me to make any moves, could be a company that skyrockets to the moon (literally) or just fizzles out - very binary. Competing car companies (on the vehicle end), the solar landscape (for their SCTY subsidiary), and the PowerWall are all industries on the cusp of either massive massive success or utter failure (and will be introduced later). I have a feeling they'll do well since the economics are really getting there (no gas, no maintenance, quick ROI for solar all great).

In any case, Tesia is not going to be showing steadying and predictability anytime soon, so I'm staying out! Would rather hit a 100% upside with 80% certainty than a 1000% upside with 10% certainty.

I am a performance nut though; I had an all-too-brief ownership experience with a B7 Audi RS 4 I took on a number of HDPE trips & autocrosses, and I've loved wrenching on / modifying cars since I was in junior high. I've been trying to convince myself to pick up a used P85 / P85+ for about a year now (with the occasional ""see how far I could stretch the budget"" dream of a P85D), but decided not to pull the trigger until after the Model 3 final reveal - just in case. Many reviews of the P85 / P85+ / P85D all mentioned it was crazy fast in a straight line, and not too shabby in the corners but that the car still felt large and heavy. Test drives I've done confirm this (I've driven a 75D and a P100D Model S, as well as a 100D Model X); while the Model S feels great, it definitely doesn't attempt to hide its heft very well in the corners the way my RS 4 did.

Granted, in the future, you won't need to stay alert, but to get autopilot to the stage where you can fall asleep in the car and wake up at your destination, you have to get through these stages first.

Using the previous example, let's say we have simplified the price point to 50k.  You've convinced a lot of the higher end buyers to buy something they were gonna buy anyway for 60k.  You've cut your initial potential profit off at the knees.  You're also missing out on buyers who are willing to pay 40k because 10 extra thousand dollars.

If Tesla were looking to sell just one product to one type of consumer, then it would make sense to even out the price point BUT, they aren't looking to sell just one type of car.  They're looking to dominate the market by riding the hype with the maximum profit product and using the gains to diversify downward by leveraging minor manufacturing process changes into products at multiple price points.

comment,73w0be,73w0be,,"I've been wrestling with this question for a while. Here is my jumble of thoughts. LONG TERM
-In general, electric engines need far less maintenance than combustion ones so car makers should make far les money on the parts market...in theory. However, as we have seen from the enlightening ""Tesla helps out hurricane evacuation"" situation, it is all but certain car manufacturers will find ways of gaining more money in the same way game developers make money off of DLC.
-There will be an increase in parts compatibility between different models/makes and more parts can be made of cheap materials (plastics/composites) simply due to the dynamic of electric engines, this will decrease production costs of vehicles which in theory will eventually make automobiles far more affordable than at any point in history. Owning a vehicle will be easier for a lot of people on a global scale, especially in the 3rd world (double the convenience if they have electricity but no easy access to a gas station/cheap fuel). 

Overall, in my non-expert analysis, I would say the car industry is approaching a new gold rush...possibly surpassing the significance of the model T. Car manufacturers will find innovative ways of squeezing money out of the consumer in the most modern of ways and more people will have access to vehicles. As soon as electric cars have a standard 400+ mile range (it will happen in 5 years) everyone with a gas vehicle will start mulling over a replacement. Fuck petroleum.

Tesla is not even any where near what they promised to produce while bleeding money. Elon Musk is great at what he does but I am starting to get the impression that he needs someone that will be his ""numbers guy"", similar to what Tim Cook did for Steve jobs. As brilliant as Elon Musk is, I don't think his goal in life is to maximize revenue for the sake of profit, increase dividends or buybacks, decrease debt, etc. He will need someone that is talented in that department while he continues to push the engineering and product development.

Musk's promotional tweeting has to stop or at least calm down a little, because is it any surprise when enough of them disappoint that people start going back and talking about how many model 3's he said he'd have in production at this point - and it's not even close?

Edit: The interior looks kinda weird, but makes sense.  If the render is correct, it's a central driving position with two rear seats; there'll be dual left and right screens and no central speedometer; in addition to the rear-view mirrors the far left and far right of the screens will have the view from corresponding rear-facing cameras, but no indication if that's permanently-on.

Oh, and there's a frunk, because why not.

Edit 2: Automatic sides that adjust to any trailers to improve aero. Anti-jack-knifing through rear-wheel torque steering. Apparently, lower cost-per mile than diesel semi, though no indication of how much upfront. When convoying with other Tesla Semis, the cost halves. ""Thermonuclear explosion-proof glass""? Riiight.

Slamming through gears, tinkering late at night over your riced-up Honda Civic with an eye towards driving around and impressing your friends, watching cars drift around a track - it's about admiring and mastering that power.

Both are very good at what they do. If you wanted to haul boxes, you'd prefer the Model X. If you want to carve up a mountain road, you'd want the Roadster.

I want the interior of the Model 3 with slightly more premium materials.

I'm on the fence about the Model Y having falcon wing doors. If they didn't have it it'd be fine but if they did i'd be excited. I think they've been making the Model X long enough now where they have the mechanism figured out to where it shouldn't have as many (if any) of the early issues the Model X falcon wing doors had. Maybe they even would have some redesign of falcon wing doors that makes them better and less likely to break/malfunction. Model Y needs some kind of thing to differentiate it from the Model 3 other than it's shape.

I want a cool design for the Model Y. A lot of crossovers i see from other manufacturers still look too big/bulky/boxy/bubble-shaped like a full size SUV does and I don't want that for the Model Y. I want the Model Y to find some middle ground where it can be slightly bigger and spacious like Crossovers should be but also still be a little sleek/sporty looking on the outside if possible.

This is an interesting point where the timing of events will be important - how soon will roads be ready for automated driving.  If the major markets are not ready for automated driving, then the EV cars (battery powered) which include automated driving will be at a competitive disadvantage (because of higher research and manufacturing costs for including automated driving).  Or will cheap EV versions take over first.  Again the Windows vs. Apple dynamic at play.

Tesla cars will have those associated higher costs:

> A new rumor says the Model Y, Tesla&#039;s planned mid-range crossover utility vehicle, is set to begin production on March 1, 2020.Automotive journalist and Daily Kanban editor E.W. Niedermeyer tweeted Tuesday he had received a tip from a parts supplier that Tesla had begun sending out designs and specifications to get quotes for the Model Y. The 2020 start date for production was part of the information this supplier had reportedly received.

> Like most Tesla offerings, a 2020 start would mean the Model Y will come a bit later than Musk&#039;s initial timeline.

> In a shareholders meeting last June, Musk had indicated the crossover vehicle would hit roads sometime in 2019.The Model Y fills in the obvious missing piece in Tesla&#039;s offerings: You can think of it either as the mid-range version of the Model X luxury SUV, or the more SUV-like equivalent of the fellow relative budget option, the Model 3.

If you are going to present before any elected body (city council, county commission, school board, etc.), you must be prepared for a public meeting with detractors. You must anticipate the obvious objections ahead of time and be fully prepared to address them. There will always be objections.  And it is for this reason that most companies hire people with experience on SLED (state, local, education) accounts who know how handle it. 

It is also a very good point that it is difficult to gain public trust if you are undermined by your CEO’s antics, but that can be overcome with the right team presenting (and the CEO is going to have to live with his team on the ground agreeing that he behavior is “eccentric” publicly). 

I’m also an Elon Musk fan. And I generally enjoy his antics. But I don’t know that I’d want to be on the front line for him trying to pitch these partnerships worth millions of dollars when he’s playing the role of eccentric billionaire.

comment,80d897,80d897,,"Purely Anecdotal from my father being a 40 year UPS employee, a union steward, and me having worked for them during college:


UPS supports their drivers way more than FedEX and the Teamsters have a lot of power at UPS. FedEX Ground used to make their drivers buy routes and trucks, I'm not sure they make them buy trucks anymore. FedEX express is company owned and the drivers don't really have to buy anything. FedEX is much more fractured in my opinion, whereas UPS operates as a well-integrated company. In order to become a driver at UPS, you have to gain seniority. In order to get the good routes, you have to gain seniority. If you switch from package to feeder (semi) then you lose your seniority for route bidding purposes. This leads to how UPS and the Teamsters interact.


The teamsters have long exercised a level of control over UPS, think the 1997 strike. Wages, benefits, and just about anything else is set every few years during Collective Bargaining. This allows the company to project these costs for several years. But, it also means that sometimes management has to do some weird things like find work to fill time. For example, as a part time employee, I was guaranteed 3.5 hours of pay every day, no matter if there was enough work for me or not. I wasn't even a union member. 

While it is accurate to say private sector (and soon to be public) unions don't have much power in 2018, it varies greatly depending on the company.

comment,87buv4,87buv4,,"No doubt.  But here's the thing:  arbitration agreements are unfair to most people because corporations are repeat players, whereas most consumers are not.  Meaning, most arbitrators have a conscious or unconscious bias toward the people who butter their bread.

However, as I thought about it, if I were forced to arbitrate here there's a chance that I'd know all the arbitrators at JAMS anyway already.  So Tesla could be at a disadvantage vis a vis my particular circumstances.  They might actually be better in the court system where at least they'd have a favorable appellate court as a backstop.

But otherwise I would always recommend opting out of arbitration agreements.

comment,88fxum,88fxum,,"Not sure why every time there’s a Tesla autopilot crash in the news it makes everyone panic... the fact that autopilot is no where near perfected is not news. I have less than 500 miles on my model S and have had to manually take over autopilot 4-5 times already to prevent a crash. It’s no where near perfected. It’s not even fully released yet. We are still in beta. We arnt even discussing fsd. The enhanced autopilot option (which is what’s currently on the streets) is no where near a full release. Until recently, the car wasn’t even using all of its cameras. Enhanced autopilot once complete will allow for use of 4/8 of the cameras on board while fsd will use 8/8. Until this newest update we were at 1/8. Not sure where exactly we stand right now as there’s been some back and forth. 

The point is autopilot is currently a driver convenience feature not a self driving feature. You need to have your eyes on the road at all times. Unless the car shifted instantly into the barrier (which it did not), this is the drivers fault, not Teslas. Anyone who owns these cars are fully aware of their current capabilities. Not saying that the driver was stretching them but maybe was distracted. Nothing that happened here doesn’t happen daily. These accidents are usually just manually prevented.

A SpaceX ICO is an interesting idea to me. In fact I just spent an hour reading up on ICOs all so I could offer an opinion on this.

I don't think an ICO would make sense for Tesla. I feel like an ICO would send the wrong message to investors in their normal stock. Imagine the headlines: ""Desperate Musk turns to ICO to save drowning Tesla from imminent death.""

An ICO might make more sense for SpaceX simply because it's a private company. But again I have my doubts here for a couple reasons.

- SpaceX has no problem raising capital from traditional investors like Fidelity and Google.
- Maybe an ICO would create tension between existing investors and ICO investors? I don't really know enough about this topic to say for sure, but it seems like something to watch for.

> Advertising and Promotion Costs

> Advertising and sales promotion costs are expensed as incurred. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, advertising, promotion and related marketing expenses were $9.0 million, $3.9 million and $2.9 million, respectively

> Marketing

> Historically, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our vehicles, and we believe we will continue to do so. To date, media coverage and word of mouth have been the primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. We also use traditional means of advertising including product placement in a variety of media outlets and pay-per-click advertisements on websites and applications relevant to our target demographics.

I'm not sure if the big shows they put on around the launches of their vehicles goes under the costs I cited above

When I said that they have a big marketing budget, I meant all activities related to sales. That showroom in Santa Monica isn't cheap, and it's arguably there mostly for marketing purposes.

The subsidy begins to phase out one full quarter after the quarter in which Tesla sells its 200,000th electric car in the U.S. By hitting that milestone after July 1, rather than a day earlier, Tesla would gain an additional three months of tax credits that could be worth more than $400 million to Tesla customers, according to Bloomberg estimates.

Big points off for steering feel. The steering was the most electronic feeling mill I’ve ever turned. All the entry level Germans are far better in what is communicated back to the driver. 

The trunk feels and sounds flimsy to close. The frunk even moreso; I was worried I was going to bend or dent it when trying to shut it. 

The glass roof is a novelty that does nothing to make the car feel more premium to me, but I get why others like it.

I will say that the audio quality of the stereo is up there with the best Ive heard, but that being said, the music interface was confusing, and the built in streaming radio often failed to load despite having four bars of cell signal.

* 7,000 model SEX vehicles in the last month of June. Mind blowing. Multiple weeks in July. Many late nights / weekends and smart ideas. Market share has surpassed all midsize premium sedans.

We need to get the cars out there. 
* Soon will have the P3D and RWD in all stores. 
* On Sunday testing the direct delivery, the guy who bought had never even sat in a Model 3. He said he loved it. It's amazing. Seems to be well received. 
* Potential for our existing lines to produce far more cars is **MUCH GREATER THAN EXPECTED**. Simplifying production lines, speeding them up, etc. 
* Our goal is to be profitable for every quarter going forward provided the economy is well and were' not in a recession.
* Sorry if I sound tired. I've been working in the body shop recently like crazy
* I'll have the Tesla team introduce themselves. (software tech, vision in neural net, self-driving tech that we've been working on for 3 years, plug in and replacement for the existing computer.)

Stewart:  

* Lots of focus on AP V9.0. Understand what lane the car is in, where the route the user wants to go, etc. Tap the navigate button and drag down.. and it would automatically navigate you to your home and work.

The rest mostly makes sense, but these two rules are fucking retarded.

Number of reports is not a legitimate metric to determine if something should be censored or not, that's called mob rule and is an invitation for politically-motivated randoms to tactically censor information. Where's the part about human intervention to confirm whether or not the content is actually objectionable (or just unpopular with certain demographics who are unscrupulous enough to mass-report it)?

And according to the second rule, Musk himself would be banned from this subreddit, as calling people pedos without evidence is a perfect example of both ""attacking others"" and ""offensive language"".

Where is the rule about trying to pushing blatant propaganda that's been debunked over and over, such as Tesla getting more subsidies than others car companies?

comment,95lx1n,95lx1n,,">PALO ALTO, Calif., Aug. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Last week, Elon opened a discussion with the board about taking the company private. This included discussion as to how being private could better serve Tesla’s long-term interests, and also addressed the funding for this to occur. The board has met several times over the last week and is taking the appropriate next steps to evaluate this.

Nothing concrete, but discussions are ongoing. What is interesting is that the statement is only on behalf of some of the board members, left out are [Steve Jurvetson](http://ir.tesla.com/board-directors/steve-jurvetson), [Kimbal Musk](http://ir.tesla.com/board-directors/kimbal-musk), and Elon.",692,False,1533734391.0,2018-08-08 15:19:51,59,0,ahatzz11,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/95lx1n/statement_from_the_following_members_of_teslas/e3tmn1e/,True,,2018,both,search,False,False,0,e3tmn1e

Those board members probably have conflicts of interest, so they recused themselves from the decision of evaluating the buyout offer and from the decision to support (or reject) it.

Of the 9 Tesla board members there's 3 board members missing from the statement:

name|role|included in statement
---|---|---
Elon Musk               |       Chairman    |

Robyn M. Denholm        |       Director                                | X
Ira Ehrenpreis          |       Director                                | X
Antonio J. Gracias      |       Director                                | X
James Murdoch           |       Director                                | X
Linda Johnson Rice      |       Director                                | X
Steve Jurvetson         |       Director                                |
Kimbal Musk             |       Director                                |

Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson are major shareholders who probably approve of the private buyout and have thus recused themselves from the decision.

Elon Musk and Steve Jurvetson are also major SpaceX shareholders, and if the buyout consortium includes SpaceX that's another conflict of interest that requires them to recuse themselves from the board decision.

Right.  My post was specifically just clarifying the ""valid avenue of material information distribution channel"".  It did not make an asserting either way regarding language used WRT to financing.  

I was incredulous of implied assertions that Tesla didn't previously inform investors of that channel (because that'd seem to be legally idiotic(?), and I think it's generally been more insightful to assume sanity/rationality on Elon and Tesla's part) and not surprised to both find the assertion false and find that naive viewpoint is glibly repeated by media's talking heads (since they're all too often about [hot takes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_take) (glib provocative narratives) and clicks] rather than slower boring nuanced accuracy.)

The difference between Apple and Tesla is that Apple is raking in money, while Tesla is hemorrhaging money. They are not even remotely comparable.

edit: You also need to make the separation between Tesla the car and Tesla the company. I happen to generally like their cars, but I also think the company is badly mismanaged and Elon Musk is a terrible leader. IMO the best thing to happen for their future would be:

* Tesla goes chapter 11
* Creditors take over and throw Elon out
* Somebody competent gets appointed
* Tesla emerges from bankruptcy better and stronger

Of course the current owners of TSLA stock will get wiped out, but that's the lesson: you can't invest based on feelz. This exact situation happened to Ford and they are doing well now.

I'm sure though that the Tesla cult of believers will not see any issue with the Chief Accounting Officer leaving after a month (""It's all FUD"", they're probably say, like they say about anything that is a negative reality about the company.) The fact that this company has any sort of credibility after the ""funding secured"" nonsense (where basically Elon called a top in the stock and also HUGELY fed the case of the shorts he hates so much) is absolutely ridiculous.

&#x200B;

\- Heat pumps are becoming increasingly useful and efficient even in low outside temperatures. It used to be that they were useless anywhere that got to freezing, but that's no longer the case.

\- While air conditioning, you have a lot of hot refrigerant that could be used to supplement a hot water heater instead of being exhausted into the outside air. 

\- Roof-top solar gets quite hot, which could be an additional heat source for refrigerant or water when needed.

\- Right now, your refrigerator is acting like a mini-air conditioner, venting heat into your home, which your air conditioner has to overcome. Imagine how much more efficient it could be if we tied that refrigerant loop into the AC unit so we could heat water with that heat or exhaust it outside the house where it doesn't drag down the air conditioner?

\- Swimming pool and spa heaters are more and more often heat pumps. They move so much air that ducting them isn't practical or possible, but they're blasting a ton of cool/cold air out into the wild where it's wasted. What if we could link that into the Heat Pump Loop and use the waste heat from the refrigerator and air conditioner to heat the pool water?

\- This one's crazier: The water running down your shower drain is still awfully hot.

Couldn't find any numbers on average distance traveled to deliver fuel, but I imagine some routes are quite significant. A fuel truck creates 1 kg of carbon every .89 miles. There are approximately 150,000 refueling stations in the US. That's a lot of carbon burning just to enable more carbon burning.

Another good talking point is the electric grid gets cleaner every day. The ICE engine seems like it's mostly tapped out on mpg improvements.

Note that's it's probably only the beginning: Einhorn's ""Greenlight Capital"" fund's third quarter ended on September 28, **when $TSLA traded at $263**.

Last Friday $TSLA closed at **$354** ... If he's still short Tesla then Einhorn's Christmas is not going to be particularly happy.

So this is only the beginning of the suffering of the ~29 million $TSLA shares still sold short.

It's also well deserved karma: the amount of lies shorts spread about Tesla was staggering and it appears they believed their own kool-aid and didn't cover in time ...

If Einhorn is still short Tesla then it's going to be a very difficult to write fourth quarter letter to investors. He should also start checking how well his personal wealth is segregated legally from the funds he is managing.

If they sell their cars for cash, then no, they don't have to raise cash.  On a big portion of sales they either write a loan on the car & hold the paper, or lease the car.  In those cases, they only get money in small monthly payments.  

In the meantime, they have spent cash to build a car -- with 4 year leases and 8 year loans (just checked Tesla's website) and 20% gross margins, it would take roughly 3 years on a lease to break even and 6 years on a loan.  

It's hard for a fast growing company to be cash flow positive when it takes 3 to 6 years to get back the cost of goods sold on a significant portion of inventory.   

So if the market if favorable, they sell some of the leases & loans to accelerate growth.

comment,a8zuie,a8zuie,,">Why are EVs still so expensive? It's literally not worth it to buy them unless you're a cab driver stuck in stand-still traffic daily.

Batteries are still very expensive. The price has come down a lot in recent years, but they're still very expensive to manufacture. 


>Why did Musk have so much difficulty perfecting the car for the factory when logically it would seem an EV would be easier to make?

Building a modern car is very hard. There are tens of thousands of hours and billions of dollars put into their development. Every other manufacturer has decades of experience perfecting their manufacturing process. Tesla itself is only 15 years old and they're only been seriously making cars for 6 years. They just don't have that same level of experience that others have. 


>Why do Teslas typically have more capacity than other cars like Nissan's Leaf? Just bigger cells?

I think there are two main reasons for this. Firstly, Teslas are bigger and heavier than most EVs. As a result, they need to store more energy. It's like how gas cars use bigger and more powerful engines in big cars. When you compare Teslas to similarly sized EVs, their battery capacity is very similar. 

The second part of this is that other EVs typically have had different goals than Teslas. Teslas aim to be a complete and total replacement to gas cars. They're made to allow you to take road trips or drive longer distances. Other EVs have historically been compliance cars.",1742,True,1545613849.0,2018-12-24 02:10:49,14,0,Fugner,cars,https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/a8zuie/why_is_tesla_model_3_such_a_big_deal/ecffvln/,True,,2018,both,search,False,False,0,ecffvln

I'll add that I think this is understating the case. The SC *network* is an advantage that is dwindling; admittedly slowly in the US, but it's dwindling.

The big advantage from my perspective in terms of charging is just raw charge speed. Even if you put the Kona on a high-powered CCS charger from Electrify America or whoever, it caps at 70 kW or 80 kW or whatever it is. The Model Y will be able to double that even on *today's* chargers, and SC v3 will widen the gap even more.

I think right now it's in purgatory as people don't really know the long term direction of the business. Will it remain an auto manufacturer with side 'gigs' in energy and storage? Or, will it become a leader in autonomy technology who just happens to also manufacture the vehicles? Or, will its bread and butter be a revolution in how we gather, store and use energy for our homes? Will it be none of the above? Will it be all 3?

People just don't really feel comfortable valuing it at any of the above. It's valued sort of as a combo of all 3 parts of the business. Not quite a leading tech company but not quite an auto manufacturer.

Is Elon prone to ignoring conventional wisdom and making overly optimistic projections? Of course. We all know this. But he’s done more to advance the space than anyone ever imagined possible.

Is Tesla in financial dire straits? Yes, they absolutely have a mountain to climb. But Eon has been here before with PayPal, SpaceX and Tesla and pulled the rabbit out of the hat when the chips were down. He does need a COO.

Are Teslas perfect? No, but they are a step change better than anything else on the road today across multiple dimensions, and continue to improve. Do we all wish it was prefect today? That would be nice, but I’m happy to compromise for a time of it means I get to drive these amazing cars every day.

I know we get the reputation as a cult, as fanbois, and Elon sycophants, but by and large I think most of the Teslarati have our eyes open to the actual issues yet to be overcome, and make a deliberate choice to be part of the early adopters who inevitably take the brunt of teething pains of anything new and transformative.

comment,bsm6m6,bsm6m6,,">The current market cap (USD 33.7B) is too low

Alright, I'll ask my usual question: why should I value Tesla higher (relative to fundamentals) than a comparable like Daimler?  Daimler has a market cap of about $60 billion right now.  They're a major player in the auto industry, semi trucks, heavy-duty vehicles like dump trucks and logging trucks, cargo vans, city buses and school buses, and box trucks.  They have a variety of electric models in the pipeline for when EVs become a profitable venture.  They've been testing electric semi trucks and box trucks for a while now, and have a pilot program with customers.  They've been doing cross-country autonomous drives with production-based hardware for 5+ years, and have started cross-country test hauls with autonomous semis.  Basically, they're what Tesla *wants* to become over the next 5-10 years or so.

$167 billion in revenue last year, and healthy margins for the industry despite it being a ""down"" year for Daimler.  Yet they're trading at 5.5x EBIT, or 0.30x sales.

One thing I disagree with you on is the seat, I'm 6'0"" tall and had no issue with getting the seat to adjust to my liking. I'm not sure what is up with the one you rented but I had no problems with the headrest and my shoulders and all that.

I also found the same problems you found with AutoPilot. It makes some *strange* decisions at times when traveling at speed in moderate traffic. It tends to work best with either a lot of slow traffic or no traffic, moderate traffic gives it the most problems. My friend says that during his morning commute he barely pays attention anymore, the car does all the work for him, since it's mostly bumper to bumper up the highway to his office.

As far as connecting with the car goes, it definitely feels like you're driving an Apple Car. The way everything is designed reminds me of my company iPhone. It's sleek and nice looking but when you need to do something nitty gritty it's a pain in the ass and often locked away from you without hacking the software. The Tesla UI feels very similar to that. I still found myself being able to enjoy driving the car, as it is RWD with Instant Torque and I didn't find the steering to be as vague as you did. I thought the steering was precise enough to enjoy the car when you were on a windy road.

A hybrid car like a Prius is as much an electric car as a Mustang is a hybrid because it has a 12V battery and a motor to start the engine.

>. The firm was previously concentrated on hybrids as a way to take advantage of its limited battery production ability as well as place even more vehicles on the road

That's a very positive outlook on life. Another would be to say they can't compete with electric cars so they put more ICE cars on the road, like 10 million units a year and they throw some batteries at a couple of them, like a small percentage that doesn't even matter.

>The firm lately started openly testing a brand-new version of its solar roofing for the Prius PHV, which can add to 44.5 kilometres (27.6 miles) of range a day, or even as much as 56.3 kilometres (35 miles) when using the auxiliary power that likewise drives Air Conditioning, navigation, and various other systems.

Is that EPA range or internal testing? Because of the size, weight and aerodynamics of the car, it's difficult to imagine it would be anything outside of careful, slow driving.

comment,catv1e,catv1e,,"Long term, I am very interested in this possibility.

I'm actually somewhat excited by V2G in general. One of the reasons that it's very difficult to make a BEV make sense for me is that I live very close to work and often don't even drive in (I'd guess long-term average is about half the time, though it tends to be bursty); e.g. my car stayed in my garage all of yesterday. If I could get paid to use that battery capacity via a V2G system, that would be *great* and mean that my car could actually be doing something. In theory, this could be an alternative way to make income from the car rather than send it out as autonomous taxi (something I think I'd be hesitant to do). The big question is how much would that pay. I've done some calculations on arbitraging TOU rates between charging at night then backfeeding the grid at day, but I think it's really unlikely to make financial sense due to the extra battery wear. So the utility would have to pay higher-than-normal peak rates. Still, could be an interesting idea as some kind of supplement to peaking plants or something from the utility's perspective to occasionally pay that.

No. The stock is half of where it was in 1994 and has largely gone nowhere in the last 25 years. If the company has not been the leader in well, just about anything for the last 25 years, what gives you the confidence that they will here? 

""Also, Panasonic produces competitively-priced solar panels""

Which is not a good business - solar has been just about the worst sector for the last decade. The automobile business is not particularly good one, either. 

""Panasonic produces batteries in partnership with Tesla,""

And there's been considerable discussion about the strained relationship between Panasonic and Tesla over the last year or so.

Commoditized business with little barrier to entry. I've said for 2-3 years now, the place to be is in green-centric utilities like NEE or warehouse REIT PLD (and their business is certainly not heavily focused on solar, but they are generating a ton of energy from panels on all their buildings around the world that they are buying from whatever company can probably deliver them the cheapest.)

""""If the company has not been the leader..."" - Is leadership in a market relevant if the main prospect is the valuation of the stock?""

Panasonic's stock is half of what it was in 1994 and has largely wandered for over two decades.  I like companies that have delivered for shareholders. Panasonic has not delivered for shareholders. Panasonic stock has a negative trailing total return % on Morningstar YTD and for the  1/3/5/10/15 year periods.

The company had largely been focused for many years on consumer electronics - the TV business is a terrible business, the digital camera business has shrunk considerably (see Canon's quarter recently) and there was little barrier to entry to a lot of the other things that Panasonic was involved in.

I don’t think it’s as good as the Tesla system but it’s pretty damn good. Hands off steering wheel it’ll complain after about 45 seconds and start to shut down after around 80 seconds. 

Volvo’s Drive Pilot is pretty good but requires too much hand-on-steering wheel. I think it balks after 15 seconds. 

Subaru and Toyota are decent but too jerky. They were somewhere between Volvo and Mercedes in terms of hand on steering wheel requirement.  

Of course, the hands-off time is usually time spent in stop and go traffic when most of these systems really shine. Or also clear wide open roads like parts of the mid-west. 

In all, I’m thrilled to see the continued development on this front, and in 5-7 years, smooth controlled assisted driving will be mainstream.",1205,False,1568496176.0,2019-09-14 23:22:56,11,0,Alienblueacct,cars,https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/d48wyg/is_kia_tellurides_driving_assist_system_as_good/f098wug/,True,,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,f098wug

comment,d5hbbw,d5hbbw,,"""A German motoring publication recently reported that Tesla’s “Plaid Powertrain” Model S prototype on the Nurburgring has effectively destroyed the lap record of the Porsche Taycan around the iconic track. What’s particularly remarkable was that the Model S reportedly beat the Taycan’s time by a wide margin. 

German media outlet Auto Motor und Sport, which has been covering the region’s auto industry since 1946, stated in a recent report that the Model S beat the Porsche Taycan’s Nurburgring lap time by almost 20 seconds. An observer from the publication recorded a hand-stopped lap time of 7 minutes 23 seconds for the Model S, far quicker than the pre-production Taycan’s time of 7 minutes 42 seconds.

Doesn't really seem like self-driving cars are going to be a thing any time soon, and the infrastructure needed to support electric cars is very far off from being available. People need to be able to find somewhere to charge their cars easily and be able to do so in a few minutes like they can with pumping gas. You're also forgetting automotive interests are fighting like hell and are far more entrenched than Tesla. They've literally been getting Tesla's business model banned in several states. As far as the barriers to entry, I don't know enough about the tech to refute your points there, but I do know the competitive landscape is filled with some of the most well resourced companies and recognizable brands in the world. They can catch up, and they can sell. Sometimes, inferior products do better because of superior brands.

As far as solar panels go, I don't know the numbers, but you can hype up the deals they make for them all you'd like, but they'd be meaningless unless they make money. I don't know that they aren't, but the points you've made about how great their solar roofs are are only as good as the numbers beneath them.

There is really one main reason to own Tesla and that’s Elon. I mean, without looking it up, think of the name the CEO of Ford, GM or VW. Can’t think of it? I couldn’t.

What you bet on with Tesla is the next new thing. Their electric cars are the iPhones of cars, and while they’ve been stagnant for a while, there’s a greater chance for a next new development with Tesla than there is with any other car company. There’s also the possibility for an unknown factor to come into play, like when Apple opened the App Store.

I think the timing is wrong in that it’s too early. I’m near term bearish on them in part because Elon’s attention seems partly focused on SpaceX and those satellites he’s sending up. The next phase for Tesla might come from that development though. Either that or 5G connectivity for the cars, with that constant communication then the system can become greatly optimized. It might be as interesting as the developments in Detroit’s smart traffic management system rollout.

I work for a large corp.

But we're also big, and stodgy, and slow.  Innovation happens in small groups whose specific job requires it, but speed, efficiency, agility, innovation... are definitely not baked into the company culture anywhere else.

Tesla is different, absolutely and fundamentally.  You can see that in everything - the multiple 'bet the company' moments they've endured, things like barely having a marketing department, barely advertising, screwing around with pricing to the detriment of customers, releasing beta software (including safety-critical features!) on a regular schedule.  If Tesla was run like a traditional solid professional company --like the one I work for-- it wouldn't have achieved a fraction of what it has in the short time it's been in existence, and the suits certainly wouldn't be rolling out beta FSD/NoA.  And part of that culture that helps Tesla to be different, is demonstrated in things like being less than perfect in areas like corporate communication.

comment,ecp9w1,ecp9w1,,"I don't know the internal operation of the Powerwall, but PV panel voltage varies with temperature and insolation by up to 20%. Clamping the voltage lower still works, but wastes a lot of potential energy. Inverters use Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) to constantly seek the voltage that generates the highest output of the PV panels and hold the input there, maximizing the electrical output of the panels. The battery cells also have an optimal input voltage that varies with SOC, so getting optimal output from PV into the battery would require precise DC-DC conversions, one to match MPPT for the PV and one to match the battery charge voltage, or a DC-AC-DC conversion. Since almost all electrical needs are AC, inverters already include the DC-AC components. Whether the battery is charged DC-DC is probably based on cost and efficiency of each design.

It looks like the Powerwall 2 can be just a battery or a battery plus inverter:

I accept that overall, Tesla FSD is already well on its way to being safer than the average driver. I think they (you) will get to level 5 driving before the others, though some might do it first in very small geofenced areas. I don't see anyone doing wide ranging level 5 within the next 2 years.

I do agree that Elon and Tesla are going to eat everyone else's lunch, and pretty soon as well, but not in FSD. I strongly suspect that Battery Day will see several announcements that will send the stock soaring. A couple of technical things, and major contracts with raw materials suppliers, maybe even a Tesla mine? Elon is not an idiot, and he goes back to first principles,  he knows Terawatt hour production rates requires a massive step up in material sources, and he will be working to secure them. Once he has secured those sources, and through that starts to ramp towards TWhr numbers, he can start negotiating more GFs for cars, *and* solar/ battery installations.",1784,True,1577295837.0,2019-12-25 18:43:57,29,0,shaggy99,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/efivfm/tesla_v_world_on_autonomy/fc0oep4/,True,,2019,both,search,False,False,0,fc0oep4

But the cash burn probably forced them to begin integrating early. My focus on profit is just coming from a perspective that respects the end goal (we are entering a world toward EVs), but in doing so I want to present the question of financial sustainability as well, because while it may not be regarded with much significance now, it will someday at some unknown date when the push toward EVs are achieved. When they are scaled up in terms of gigafactories/ global presence, will it finally show on the bottom line as well? Thank you for the feedback!

In the images sent to Teslarati, Elon Musk can be seen inspecting the rear of the Cybertruck and its motorized rear tonneau, as film crew busily prepared equipment for the camera truck that would follow the stainless steel pickup past SpaceX.

Cameras rolled as the Tesla Cybertruck made its way onto Crenshaw Blvd. in Hawthorne, CA, with the iconic Falcon 9 booster and SpaceX headquarters framed perfectly in the background. A black truck with a camera rig flanked the electric pickup truck.

comment,etsfa4,etsfa4,,"The reason GF1 hasn't expanded is quite simple: they already have enough capacity.

GF1's current capacity is 35 GWh, which by itself is enough for around 443k US-made Model 3/Ys, plus 4 GWh of energy storage. For reference, Tesla produced 302k Model 3s last year and deployed 477 MWh of storage in Q3.

According to a recent [Elecrek article](https://www.electrek.co/2019/12/30/tesla-gigafactory-1-panasonic-ready-ramp-up-battery-cell-production/), GF1 ~~will~~ could soon ramp to 54 GWh, ~~presumably without expansion~~ though it is unclear whether this would require expansion of the building.

**Edit**: Here is the relevant quote from the article:

>Allan Swan, the head of Panasonic’s US battery manufacturing unit based inside Tesla Gigafactory 1, said that they could now ramp up to 54 GWh:  
>  
>“For us to move to \[54GWh\] should not be so hard. We now have the knowhow to do it in quite a high volume environment,”

I'm not saying they don't need to expand, but it's not a dire issue yet. Tesla is expected to produce somewhere in the ballpark of 650k cars this year, 150k of which will be built at GF3 in Shanghai, and the other 500k at Fremont, of which about 75k will be Model S/X and 425k will be Model 3/Y. Of all of these, only the 425k Model 3/Ys will be getting battery cells from GF1. Assuming an average pack size of 70 KWh, these cars would require 30 GWh of cells.",1878,True,1579973987.0,2020-01-25 18:39:47,34,0,brandude87,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/etsfa4/gigafactory_1_development_not_on_part_with/ffihhit/,True,,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,ffihhit

Now all that is true as AMZN is taking over the world, but do not miss the fact that the AMZN stock price dropped from the adjusted $86/share in April of 99 back to $6/share in Aug of 2001.

This also prevents non-authorized repairs to battery packs or other hazardous materials, which is desirable in an industrial context but not necessarily good for consumers.

Of course, this just creates a situation where car electrical repairs have to be tackled with the same seriousness as home electrical repairs. This day has been coming for a long time, but Tesla will probably force mechanics in general to do better here (no more wirenuts, tin solder or electrical tape) as other companies adopt similar standards.

1.) The future of transportation is unquestionably electric and at least partially autonomous in the near future transitioning to full once the technology is developed over a longer period of time. Batteries, electric drivetrains and autonomous technology are the things to invest in and Tesla is a pure play in all 3. This doesn’t even include solar which is another hot market (sans covid slowdown).

2.) The legacy autos will have a harder time switching to electric and autonomous and its not even clear right now if some of them could ever fully transition without a significant restructuring or bankruptcy in some cases.

comment,hx35h0,hx35h0,,"


Elon Musk said Tesla Semi truck will be built in Gigafactory Austin (or Giga Texas) and the work has already started building Tesla's largest Gigafactory so far. 

During the conference call following Tesla’s Q2 2020 financial results yesterday, the automaker’s management team made new very brief comments about Tesla Semi trucks' production plans and location. ""We’re going to be doing a major factory there. And it’s also where we will be doing Cybertruck there, the Tesla semi program, and we will be doing Model 3 and Y for the eastern half of North America,"" said Elon. 

Jerome Guillen, Tesla’s president of automotive and the head of the Tesla Semi program, added some comments about the plan during the same call: ""We’ll start production next year, as we announced before. I personally care very much about the project. I can’t wait. We do have a few trucks that keep driving around and that can deliver cars. But we’re going to accelerate that. I want to be clear that the first few units, we will use ourselves, Tesla, to carry our own freight, probably mostly between Fremont and Reno, which is a fantastic test route. We’re going to prove that we have very good reliability. So far, the early units do have it, but we’ll do that at a larger scale.

comment,hzh57p,hzh57p,,"You know I had never really considered the Venn diagram of bearish views and income/wealth. Makes a lot of sense now that you got me thinking about it.

I do think with the advent of fractional trading that you can start doing things like adding .003 of a share of SHOP or TSLA to a small account. And while investing strategy does differ based on portfolio size, risk tolerance is (or should be) primarily a function of age assuming that the money you're investing is not needed for several decades. 

Tbh I think a lot of what we're talking about with people on this sub is emotional behavior rather than actual strategy. 

I do agree that there's no one-size fits all strategy but you will see me recommending the [Three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) to most people that aren't suited/ready for stock-picking. It's a pretty nice solution for a lot of people's investing needs.

You nailed it 10,000%. I think I figured it out. Elon is continuously saying ""What is the simplest/cheapest we could possibly make this?""

* Technically we should be able to ship out all spare parts as required, no need to keep spare parts in stock! No need to open more service locations because in theory, everything should be doable by sprinter vans!
* Deliveries - Delivering a car should take 5 minutes! (many many delivery horror stories, car being in wrong place, show up and there's damage to the car, VIN unattached, delivery people don't return calls, customers show up and wait around for 2 hours and have to go back home.. etc.)
* Sales - Everyone is laid off, effectively immediately!!!! (whatever happened to that?)

This is what I would consider “hard money”, since you need a certain sequence of things which you have no control over to come into play to win big on this deal.

On the flip side, “easy money” would be something like Generac (GNRC). They primarily provide generators (both residential and commercial) and have increased revenues YoY plus have introduced new product lines (to cover new markets like solar, for example). 

California is currently under brownout periods with the threat of having blackouts. This will persist as the weather just won’t cooperate for folks. We just had a hurricane hit the US too and we’re bound to have a few more weather related incidents before the end of the year. People need electricity. They will be buying generators to ensure that their lights stay on.

*If Tesla is going to justify a half-trillion market capitalization, it needs to increase its sales from $24.6 billion in 2019 to approximately $140 billion by 2030. This would require an annualized growth rate of 19 percent, and end up with the company becoming as big as G.M. and Ford are today.*

*At the same time, Tesla also needs to expand its net profit margin, the money earned for shareholders per dollar of sales. By our calculations, its net margin will need to increase from minus 3.5 percent in 2019 to over 21.5 percent by 2030. That means that by 2030 Tesla’s margin would converge to what Apple’s is today. Toyota is among the most profitable big automakers, and its margin in its latest fiscal year was around 7 percent.*

~~>I can speak with authority on this stock - it is a scam. Everything about it is a scam. Look at their marketing. These people are using Theranos as a business model. ""Improve access"" ""disrupt"" ""Revolutionary"" ""AI"". They want a bunch of dipshits to buy the hype so they can cash out.

>1a) Their technology: Their video implies that heat is why a CT gantry rotates. Its not. The gantry rotates to produce a 3D image. There is a small anode that does rotate but who gives a shit? I don't believe at all they have an xray source on a chip but even if they did - guess what? It doesn't fucking matter. Without rotating, the best they can do with their tech is a shitty tomosynthesis image that will be worthless for diagnosis. Dozens of my colleagues have contacted the company for an example image and the replies from nanox go silent at that point.

>1b) Their mammography claims: ""SINGLE CELL SPATIAL RESOLUTION"" Right there should be enough to show this is a scam. No magical xray source is going to give you single cell resolution. That's why we have microscopes. Even if possible, they show they don't know what it means and claim single cell imaging will help ""Distinguish the cyst from tubular growth or neovasculature"".",3656,True,1600209002.0,2020-09-16 00:30:02,4,0,mendeddragon,investing,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/it9a1w/citron_did_a_report_on_nnox_but_it_seems_to_be/g5etdpp/,True,,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,g5etdpp

**Are Tesla cars the best in the world? No they are not...**

They suffer from bad assembly, sometimes rattle, panel gaps, thin paint... **But that's not the function of Tesla...** Tesla excels in software and, because of that, stays away from Android and Apple because adopting the software from a third party means adopting their limitations.

**So what is Tesla then?**

Tesla is the firm that pushes forward continuously, it is a driver for innovation and a benchmark other car makers are trying to catch up to. It creates innovation, in softwarem drivetrain and in batteries and spends little time trying to innovate in things other carmakers do better. 

The latest innovation is the octovalve, a stroke of genius. Before that it was offsetting magnets in the motor to produce more torque at the wheels. Before that it was the batteries... And so on...

You buy a Tesla for the sole reason that it does what other carmakers never though of doing before and forces the other manufacturers to play catch up.

If you want to buy a car for the paint quality, get a Rolls Royce. If you want perfect panel gaps, buy a Mercedes. If you want no rattles, buy an Audi...

It is logical to charge resource maintenance payment from people using that resource as opposed from everyone via income tax or something.

Infrastructure was funded by gasoline taxes - the more you drive the more you pay. Logical and seemed like a good idea at a time as all cars used gas. This is no longer true.

Majority of road damage comes from cargo vehicles and not your typical cars - ICE or EV, does not matter. With Semi on the horizon this is a very valid concern of what to do.

You could not simply raise gas tax as ICE revolution is already here and soon (relatively speaking) there will be no gas tax at all nor any ICE on the road, hence no money for road maintenance. You can not tax power at supercharger either, because people will just set up their own chargers and avoid that tax. Setting up your own tax free oil refinery is more difficult :-)

EV initiatives and EV tax is not mutually exclusive either. So the solution should be permanent EV tax (as in the article), ideally - somehow by mileage driven.

My takeaway, rating the Bolt, ID.4 or any other non-Tesla lower due to their charging network is not being fair to the vehicle. Tesla owns their supercharger network and has an incentive to ensure it works. 

None of the other manufacturers own a charging network. There's no reason to rate them lower for something they have no control over. That would be like rating any ICE vehicle based on a bad experience at a Shell station.

comment,key7ub,key7ub,,"I paid a flat $150 EV fee to register a Model 3 in Indiana this year, and saw it as a win at best or break even at worst on gas tax savings. Then the car got totaled three months later... when replacing the vehicle, I had to pay the state ANOTHER $150 flat fee for the same calendar year for the replacement Model 3. Now I’m definitely in the negative.

To be clear, this $150 flat EV fee was on top of over $500 is annual taxes and registration fees the state imposes based on their assessed value of the vehicle. So that means, in 2020, I have paid close to $900 in registration and EV fees for a Model 3 SR+.

Australia. Comparing some models you've listed, driveaway prices with 1 CAD pretty much = 1 AUD:

- Kona electric is **$63-$71k** (£35-40k, €39-44k, US$48-54k

- Ioniq electric is $53-58k (£30-33k, €33-36k, US$40-44k)

- Tesla model 3 starts at $72k (£40k, €44k, US$55k)

- Nissan Leaf is $53k (£30k, €33k, US$40k)

- BMW i3 is $77k (£43k, €48k, US$59k)

For a bit of context, the petrol Kona starts at $27k, and a Toyota Camry at $29k, so we're being particularly shafted with EVs.

Kia EVs, the VW e-Golf, VW ID#, Peugeot e208, Renault Zoe etc aren't available here. Also there are no government incentives, and charging infrastructure is growing a bit but is still not amazing.

Off grid, I had about 70% usable capacity with cool weather (within a few degrees above or below freezing at night). 

New inverters are IEEE1547 conformant (60.5Hz shut down) when commissioned for US/Canada, and Tesla can change the PW solar curtailment frequency to a more reasonable one so extended off-grid operation doesn't trip appliances.

QS is very early in its infancy stage and apart from the amount of things that would have to go right for them, the other companies that are already in market have plans for better battery as well.

I think they designed their cars like people design consumer electronics.  ~~This exact~~ A similar issue hit the Google Nexus 7 tablet, and it becomes dog slow because the flash memory is low quality and needs mitigations to compensate.  

The problem is that Tesla didn't care about reliability or longitivity of their cars until recently.  So previous design decisions are rearing their heads, like screens that aren't sunproof and flash memory that was never provisioned in a way to last more than a few years.

I hate how The Verge described this inaccurately.  For the curious, I can provide some background because I work at a company that deals with flash memory a lot.  NAND chips (often called flash storage) hold electric charges in billions of cells across the chip. Those charges are the 1s and 0s that form your data. Just like all chips, defects will creep in during manufacture and cells will stop working.  To account for this, all chips use some form of redundancy so that data can be recovered.  But those dead cells are still unusable, reducing your effective storage.  To compensate, these chips are ""provisioned"".  A flash controller with a chip that can hold 70 GB could only offer 64 GB to the system.  The remaining 6 GB are spare cells that the memory controller can use as replacements for dead cells.",2923,True,1610610340.0,2021-01-14 08:45:40,776,0,andrewia,cars,https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/kwvv6x/tesla_asked_to_recall_158000_model_s_and_model_x/gj7huti/,True,,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,gj7huti

comment,l7qlfh,l7qlfh,,"Yeah... So I've found a pretty massive wrench in everyone's thesis.

The short interest results that were posted 1/27 were actually settled 1/15. There has been enough volatility in the past 2 weeks for shorts to easily close out without anyone noticing. If that's true, it would make sense for them (or anyone) to short again while above 300, especially if they knew the original 61 million shorts were already cleared.

People also keep saying ""Days to Cover is still 2.5!"" Yeah, that doesn't mean anything in a volatile market like this. Days to Cover, aka Short Interest, is a function of (Shares Shorted) / (Avg Volume). Avg volume is over the past 30 days. The first 15 of the past 30 days saw much lower volume. Current Short Ratio is closer to 0.5-1. If they could cover their entire positions in 1 day (causing a spike obviously), who's to say they didn't clear over a 10 day period (causing the spikes we saw), then, knowing they lost $4 billion (if cleared around the $62 price range, which I suspect), why not take out new short positions around $300? The price can't go up any more if there's no short squeeze coming.

Just my 2 cents. I get downvoted for this on WSB, so it's apparent no one wants to objectively discuss this very real possibility.

comment,lae3d4,lae3d4,,"Tesla is considered a ""growth"" stock while Toyota is a ""mature"" stock.

Tesla isn't being judged on today's profits but what people think its profits will be in the future, while Toyota is judged on today's profits. 

Most people think Tesla will increase its market share by significant amounts. Tesla currently sells less then 1% of world wide cars. In 2035, what will be Tesla's market share? Will it ""just"" increase 1000% to 10%? Will EVs become the most dominate type of car and Tesla's EV market share is 81% in the US currently could it have that type of market share world wide for all cars? 

By investing in Tesla are investors going to get some backdoor profits from SpaceX? SpaceX is not a publicly traded company even though lots of people want to invest in it and some see investing in Tesla as the next best thing. 

Do you think Tesla full self driving is going to be the dominant self driving company or will that go to Waymo? Or will there be multiple self driving companies that are all roughly the same?

Lastly do you think that Tesla has a moat around battery technology? The same way that no other company can touch Google in search because they gained a technology lead then continued to invest in it. Now pretty much no other company really tries and rivers Google search. Maybe Tesla batteries will be the same.

comment,lb3u4l,lb3u4l,,">Tesla Model S and Model X units built between 2012 and 2018 are known to have a debilitating issue with the media control unit (MCU). The memory used in the system has a finite amount of write cycles and the system constantly logs tons of data on the memory. So the car eventually exceeds the designed limit for write cycles, which can cause write and read errors as the car's memory effectively freezes certain bits. That can lead to glitches, restarts, and total failure of the central touch screen as the system becomes unable to use its own internal memory. **And while many cars have common failure points, this is notable because the design makes this eventuality certain for all affected cars.**

So literally every single Model S and X from 2012-2018 will eventually have this fail.

It's a pretty easy fix going forward; just have that unit be replaceable, and put it down as like a 200k scheduled maintenance.

Will this meme ever die? They sell cars. Everything else people pitch them as  selling is just speculation or a business you'd 100% expect a 21st century car company to be in. You think Toyota isn't working on battery tech? You think GM isn't working on self-driving? You think Fiat doesn't provide software for vehicles? Yet, would you call these companies anything other than a car companies? Everything else with Tesla is a glorified side-hustle.

Oh, their an energy company? Ok... so, where's their big move into this space? What justifies the price? How much US energy infrastructure is built atop Tesla tech? What's been planned, and what's been executed, and what's the competition? All these questions just get a big shrug and a ""well, they make batteries"". On that note:

&#x200B;

\> Where are they going to get the batteries? How are their customers going to charge them?

\> The answer: Tesla.

\> Musk has made it clear from the beginning that their intent is to supply batteries for the entire EV *industry*

I think this sums up one angle the Tesla hype in a nutshell. It's the weird assumption Tesla has a monopoly on this and that, and always will. They don't, they never have, and they never will.

But I've got zero interest in owning one.

Volvo is also much less of a ""sporty"" brand than Audi/BMW/Merc.  

You might say ""Ah, but these are luxury cars, people buying them don't care about sportiness.""  But I think that mindset is outdated as the sedan market has shifted.

The people who don't care about sportiness are buying SUVs and CUVs these days.  Sedans are less popular than ever, so percentage-wise the remaining buyers like sportiness.  Toyota recognizes this- it's why they've made a conscious effort to make the Camry more engaging.

Another (probably unpopular to bring up but whatever) point about the changing sedan market, I'd wager a higher % of sedan-buyers care about cool factor/sex appeal.

comment,mudcnh,mudcnh,,"The problem with the Tesla crash is that battery fires can get hot enough to decompose water, turning it into hydrogen and oxygen. They can also start metal fires.

An EV fire in a large pileup would easily ignite the other cars, turning a simple mass of twisted metal and minor injuries into a large, uncontrollable, fire.

Even if there isn't a fire, other vehicles may become electrically charged if there is damage to the electrical system.

In 2013, the DoE (under Obama) stated ""In areas where a suitable water source is not present and  there are no threats to life safety or to nearby structures, vehicles, or other  combustibles, allowing the battery pack to burn to self-extinguishment may  be a viable alternative to suppression."".

comment,nhfij4,nhfij4,,"As a Tesla owner with the FSD package, this statement is ridiculous:

>Its time and energy could be better spent on developing a driver monitoring system for Autopilot to significantly improve the safety and usefulness of that system.

No. Just no. Cameras on the driver isn't going to make their systems ""safer"" or more ""useful"".

For all the situations that FSD is advertised to be used in, and many that it isn't, their systems do an A+ job at both piloting the vehicle and alerting the driver to take over when the AI isn't confident what to do.

Auto-Steer and Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, often referred to together as Autopilot, can't drive _everywhere_, but the number situations they can handle extremely well is impressive. Freeways have been a solved problem for Tesla for years. Lane changes, also solved for freeways and city streets. Stop signs, street lights, construction zones, speed limit signs, all solved with vision -- the car will come to a complete stop at a stop sign without intervention, or would slow down and alert the driver when entering a construction zone. Even roads with poor or no lane markings are handled quite well. If the car isn't confident, it prompts the driver to take over. It's a PHENOMENAL system.

Only uniformed people who hear ""Autopilot"" and jump to the conclusion that it should be able to take you from A to B without intervention complain. Nobody is claiming that it does that. It's a driver _assist_ system, it's not a replacement for a driver.",2392,True,1621566112.0,2021-05-21 05:01:52,78,0,A_Crunchy_Leaf,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nhfij4/consumer_reports_publishes_scathing_review_of/gywhnle/,True,,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,gywhnle

comment,nm4kla,nm4kla,,"There's some very good info here, but you haven't explicitly stated the fundamental operation of the balance sheet.  Why is it called that?  The accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Equities.  If you add up everything that belongs in the asset section of the balance sheet the total MUST equal the sum of everything in the liabilities and equities sections.  

If our business is a farm, the assets are the farm land, the barn, the tractors, and the crops.  The liabilities are the mortgage and the workers pay that they earned last week, but the farm has paid yet.  The equity is the cash the farmer used to buy the farm and the profit that the farmer has not paid to himself.  

Under normal circumstances, the crops are sold.  This reduces the crop asset, but increases the cash asset.  Hopefully we sold the crops for more than their value on the balance sheet and turned a profit. That means the cash asset increases more than the crop asset decreases.  The difference is added to retained earnings, which is part of the equities section.  We are still in balance.

 Then, we pay the mortgage and the workers.  The cash asset is reduced and the mortgage and worker pay liabilities are reduced.

The only thing I would like a bit more of is sound proofing but the latest Model 3 is better in that respect. Compare the Model 3 with the interior of the VW ID.3 though and you'll see swathes of hard plastic in the VW where the Tesla has soft touch plastics and is much better. Also, dressing an unreliable car up in leather and wood means it is comfy while you're waiting by the side of the road I guess. Personally, I'll take all the money I spend being put into the car itself as long as the interior is good and hard wearing.

They aren't, it's $130 for the valve alone (see [epc.tesla.com](https://epc.tesla.com)).

So they employ a rule that is permitted to anyone, but they are given “too much leeway”?  I would argue that it is a rule not even a loop hole.  It seems very clearly laid out - you can build early with the risk of having to pay to have it torn down, or you can wait.  But it is not like they bribed someone to do this.  It is a legal option but rarely exercised by German firms.

EDIT:  Now after reading the rest of the article, my biggest question is WTF he picked Germany in the first place?  Tough business regulations, strong labor unions.

comment,q9iyxe,q9iyxe,,"Because analysts go to school to learn how to value companies in ways that only make sense if the industry is not changing.  

Take for example coca cola. Nothing coke does is going to significantly impact their market share. There is no technological marvel that will make coke obsolete or give them an edge against the competition. They are in a mature industry of bottling, canning, and distributing. The financial models wallstreet used are based on looking at companies like coca cola and trying to determine if money can be made within a quarter or a year and no longer than that by buying or selling a mature company with no significant amount of ground to be gained or lost.  

Tesla has two problems when it comes to wallstreet. The first is that it is a disruptive company, meaning Tesla's success directly offsets not a competing brand but the existence of other products entirely. This means that it's value isn't purely tied up into profits today, and it isn't possible to use historical models based on the automotive industry, but that doesn't mean analysts aren't going to insist this isn't the case and try to shoehorn the company into one of those models.

You’re right they don’t get the same amount of sales as traditional car makers. But they offer arguably the best EVs on the market. 

Their fans aren’t delusional. It’s marketing. Same reason iPhone sales never slowed down despite Android users having all the “top features” before them. The issue is here is Tesla has the marketing of Apple, and the “cost” of the android. 

What do you mean by “no actual data”? Are they supposed to release statistical results of products years before they release them? 

Autopilot is getting sued and rightfully so. There have been accidents and deaths. But there is a difference between their autopilot and self driving packages. And the thing is, no other car maker has an auto pilot software package that comes close to Tesla. Yes there are assisted driving packages, but Tesla also has over 5 years of data for their autopilot and self driving features. That data is the most valuable thing for them, as it will keep their software years ahead of the competition. Would I personally use autopilot? No. But is Tesla the world lead in automated driving? Yes. 

Honestly, you need to define what “catch up” means. Are traditional car makers going to catch up in EV sales? Yes. Most carmakers have begun the process of transitioning fully electric.

I don't gamble. Ever. Super, super conservative financially. I am debt free. This was my everything on black moment. And sonofabitch if I am not the luckiest mofo on Earth.

All I have to say is, you're right...TSLA is pricing in a optimistic scenario with all items you have mentioned and passingly mentioned at the end. People who dont understand this are just mad they missed the party.

I don't even hold TSLA, but from all my research I have done everything you have mentioned could potentially happen and justifies the large market cap at the moment.

comment,qumuxo,qumuxo,,">We contacted Ford public relations, who confirmed our suspicions. ""The GT has around 5 seconds of [maximum] boost, so once that boost is used up, it needs to recharge,"" we were told. That means it can only deliver 5 seconds of full power at a time before the battery takes a breather. In a direct comparison against the Model Y Performance, which had no problem delivering full power whenever we asked, this made the Mustang Mach-E GT feel underwhelming to say the least.

Wow, pretty shitty to limit the max power to 5 seconds. The Mach-E looks much better than the duck-lipped Y but if you can't use all the power all the time, seems like a huge rip-off to go with the GT.

Cathie Wood-led Ark Invest said on Monday that Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) latest move to allow car sharing on its mobile app brings its user one step closer towards monetizing their electric car and transforming it from a ""stranded asset"" into a ""revenue generating machine.""  
What Happened: Ark analyst Tasha Keeney said speculation has been rife that Tesla is planning a ride-hailing network after its recent software update that allows owners to share the vehicle with others via the phone app.   
A Twitter account that monitors the app store for any new updates on the Tesla app, had last week revealed that the new version of the electric vehicle maker’s mobile app has a feature that allows owners to share cars.  
Version 4.3.1 has been released here's what we've found:  
\-Sharing your Tesla vehicle with others  
\-Asset for vehicle sharing  
\-Endpoints related to vehicle sharing

They didn't run into any red tape. Tesla has to comply to all rules and laws in Germany. Just like any other company has too. They got plenty of pre-approvals and all their submitted documents and applications are being fast tracked. For a project this size in Germany, it's going *very* quick.

> environmental groups had managed to obtain an extension of the public commentary period for the project

And rightfully so! No special treatment for anyone. 

The state tried to fast track the public hearing process but broke its own rules by doing so. They got caught by the public and now have to re-do it properly. If they don't, the state would open doors for lawsuits that would put the whole project at jeopardy. Better safe than sorry.

It also doesn't help that Tesla itself repurposed entire buildings they already had built. A huge warehouse suddenly became the building for cell production for example. Because of that the whole approval process for the building and its intended use had to be re-done. This wouldn't have been necessary if Tesla stated the real purpose of the building from the get go. Delays like this are self made.

Tesla also didn't stick to it's own submitted construction plans multiple times and still were given leeway to proceed. The whole area is a groundwater reserve.

Most recently, environmental groups had managed to obtain an extension of the public commentary period for the project, which delayed approval for another month. The new period concluded last month, and Tesla has been rumored to be on the verge of approval, but it has yet to happen.

comment,rshvy0,rshvy0,,">At the time of this writing, you're kidding yourself if you think that there's any other viable EV option besides a Tesla

I think you left off what you expect in a car. If you're looking for a ""one size fits all"" car that is a drop-in replacement for conventional cars, it's going to be hard to find the perfect EV, especially if you enjoy long distance driving.

But if you're looking for a commute car and have a place to charge it (at work or home), an EV is a great option. I have a 100 mile range EV and love it -- it goes everywhere I need to go. It's a stretch to make the 50 mile trip to the airport, but 15 minutes of charging while I wait for the person to call to say her flight is here is enough to eliminate the range anxiety for the trip home.

It's not our only car, we have a Honda Accord Hybrid that we use for long trips (and my wife uses occasionally while I'm at work). But having the EV  for the daily commute means that we buy fuel so infrequently that I put fuel stabilizer in it to keep the fuel fresh between refueling stops.

I'm waiting until I can afford a car with 400+ miles of range before replacing the Honda with an EV (which means long range cars will need to be cheaper, or I'll need to become more wealthy). This  should give a solid 300+ miles of real world range, so on a long trip, we can drive 7 or 8 hours (which is generally a full day of driving for us) with just a single lunch/recharging stop in the middle.",1454,False,1640928636.0,2021-12-31 06:30:36,897,0,sfbiker999,cars,https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/rshvy0/why_i_sold_my_tesla_model_3_performance_went_back/hqnch35/,True,,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,hqnch35

 The difference between me and probably many others is that I actually have the cash to buy the car outright and it's invested. So over 5 years or so I'd pay about 1700 in interest and the 50k or so invested would return 30k if I get normal market returns for the same 5 year period.  

If I bought the car outright and put that car payment back in the market monthly I figure I could get to 60k ish.  But also I'd have to be very disciplined and invest that car payment monthly

I don't feel that most people should be buying an expensive car like a Tesla unless they have substantial net worth, maxed out retirement options, own a home , are debt free, have an emergency fund and have the amount of cash necessary to buy the car outright.

I use to think a Tesla as just a luxury car until I saw Tesla crash test videos and understood why an EV can be engineered to be so much safer than a gas car. After realizing that, I wouldn’t buy a gas nor hybrid car ever again; all the tech and bells and whistles are just pluses on top of a safer car that doesn’t pollute.

comment,st09kt,st09kt,,"First of all, I’d like to point out there’s only one Wall Street analyst with a price target as low as yours, and they all do much more extensive modeling and plenty of them are bearish and/or dislike Tesla and the hype surrounding it. 

Now, let’s get specific. Your problem is that you assumed that Tesla would grow revenue 26% per year and profit 29% per year (much lower than what they are guiding for, but ok) through 2030 and still get a P/E of 15? That’s ridiculously low for that level of growth. AMZN P/E is around 74 ($3,100 divided by $41.91 EPS excluding one time Rivian stock gain) for lower levels of growth. And before you pull the “but it’s an automotive company” bullshit, think for a second. Tesla already has the highest net income margin in the automotive business and still expanding, has virtually no debt, and has been able to grow faster than any other automotive company. Nothing about Tesla’s business fundamentals says it’s a traditional auto, and it should not be valued as such. You will never see Tesla at 15 P/E this decade.

Your other problem is assuming flat net income margin through 2030. Tesla has shown incredible and consistent operating leverage (meaning operating expenses grow more slowly than revenue/gross profit) hence their constant margin expansion over the last couple years. This is probably your most bearish assumption. 

Overall, your assumptions are just very, very bearish relative to the current reality right now.",1669,True,1644932048.0,2022-02-15 14:34:08,337,0,32no,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/st09kt/tsla_bullish_price_is_287usd_dd/hx177ff/,True,,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,hx177ff

Tesla won't grow that much, given rising input costs, increasing inflation. Also it is a lot easier to scale from 100,000 to 1m, if you factories can produce that much. It is another to get from 1m to 10m -  given the need for new factories. We see how long Berlin takes to open.

comment,tmj8dn,tmj8dn,,"Because it’s not going to be perfect.

People who buy Teslas (myself included when I did) have to come to terms with the fact that you’re getting performance, tech, and range per dollar, not luxury per dollar. 

The Plaid is a flawless example - it has crazy performance, great tech, and solid range at a lower price than say, Lucid, where you’re getting all that plus better materials and build quality. But a Lucid Air that comes close(ish) to Plaid performance costs tens of thousands more. Reasonably so. 

Now my .02 after owning my Model 3 is that Tesla level quality shouldn’t exist on a $50k Model 3, but at the same time, $50k on a BMW 3 series with better build/interior doesn’t net you the tech the Tesla has, or the acceleration, or the fact that it’s an EV and not ICE. If Tesla wanted to do all they do and then have better build and materials, it would cost more. They *very* clearly build to hit a price point, and would rather chase the “cool” things instead of actual quality per dollar. 

The people who say “Tesla quality is awful” - yes it is, but you’re buying a full size sedan or SUV that does 0-60 quicker than a Veyron, has excellent tech, and hauls the whole family for $130k. Where else are you going to get all that *plus* great quality at that price point? You won’t, and you can’t.

It all comes down to what you value. You can’t get everything *and* get it cheap. Hating Tesla quality is reasonable.

My understanding is that if Tesla were to find out that your vehicle was repaired outside of their control, it can be blackballed from the supercharging network.

If this is changing now, then that is HUGELY positive for Tesla. They are the only automaker currently making money on EVs even though their cars are already cheaper than their competitors' models with equal specs.

Tesla has WAY more pricing power, so if EVs are changing from a toy for rich people to a car for every day people, that's a huge problem for those other automakers you mentioned.

Tesla gets the headlines because of its overall valuation, but on percentage terms, it’s only down marginally higher than other large car stocks.

Having said that, investors priced Tesla at its peak like it’s the Apple of car stocks. The car industry is vastly different, and I’m of the opinion that the new Toyota EV (the Toyota BZ4X) is going to fly off the shelves. Not because it’s the best EV or has the best performance figures, but because Toyota has some of the most loyal customers in the world. It’s perceived as the most reliable and trustworthy brand, and it’s why the Corolla and RAV4 are the two highest selling cars by volume in the world. The Corolla isn’t the best car in its class, but everyone that buys it knows what they’re getting (reliability, ease of use, build quality, resale value, good capped priced servicing etc).

Tesla don’t even make the best EV in the world. The best EV according to various 2021 car of the year awards is the Kia EV6. 

The interesting aspect to Tesla that I’m waiting to see play out is the polarising views of Musk himself.

Coming from the ICE world it's a weird feeling to drive 70 in an 80 mph limit. But there weren't many cars and I just kept to the right. I also mentally prepared myself to drive about 10 hours at 65 - 70 mph, rather than try to beat the navigation's ETA.

Regarding efficiency, definitely be aware of headwinds. A 15 mph headwind (not unheard of along I-40) will give driving at 85 mph the efficiency of driving at 100 (nearly), and that reduces efficiency way more than you'd expect.

Another thing you can do is find a tractor trailer going a comfortable speed, then use Autopilot to stay \~3 car lengths back (Autopilot setting, which is much greater than 3 car lengths in practice).

How can you make this argument for Tesla (which has much more mature manufacturing lines for their EV models - ie less room for optimization), but not apply it to legacy autos. 

If Ford, is at zero margin on their first pass at this, I'd actually consider that a good thing for ford.

Either way, autos will always be low margin enterprises. I would look for Tesla's margins to come down in-line with everyone else.

Yes, but because it is a bear market, and many stocks are likely to make new lows in the coming months.

- AMZN is down 36%

- MSFT is down 4%

Berlin is hoping to hit 2,000 per week soon, and perhaps 5,000 per week late this year. In Q4 alone and barring any major shutdowns or depressions (seemingly more likely by the day) Tesla's 4 factories could produce 300,000 model Ys.

With Berlin and Austin just starting to ramp, it seems Tesla is hoping to produce around 1.5m model Ys next year, I can't see a market for that many $50k+ variants, so I imagine price cuts would be in order, but who knows?

There is nothing more aggravating than having to change stalls just to get a charge, or to get a decent rate.  Find a stall, park, pull up the app, punch in the station/stall code, plug in while holding the top part of the CCS charger (communication part) tight against the car and hope that it initiates, wait to see if it starts and gives full power, rinse and fucking repeat if it doesn't.

comment,xec5wv,xec5wv,,"# “The person in the driver’s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not driving anything. The car is driving itself.”

I think this quote says it all.  Tesla claimed that their self driving tech was so close to release that the only obstacle was regulatory approval.  This was absolutely 100% a lie at the time it was claimed.  And that claim sold not just Autopilot but a lot of Tesla cars.  ""It's an Appreciating Asset because it has the hardware to be a robotaxi!"" That's a claim that Elon has made numerous times.

Elon has also said that 'there was no question, guaranteed, based on the data he's seeing internally that FSD would be as safe or safer than a person by the end of the year without any supervision.'

This is also 100% a lie.  If we look at the public FSD Beta Tracker data, FSD Beta is **today** many orders of magnitude away from human safety (unsupervised) and the trend lines **today** are definitely *not* trending toward human safety within the next 2+ years.

There's being overly optimistic and there's a lie that's counter to all of the data.    If I say ""Based on my current speed I'll be in the office in 30 minutes."" but you're in New York City and the office is in LA, it's not being ""overly optimistic"" that you'll maybe get abducted by aliens and carried by a UFO at hypersonic speeds and then dropped off in the parking lot... you're lying.

We paid $60,000 for the car and to remove or disable physical parts that we pay for is not cool. There are some things that were on my 2016 Ford edge that are not on my 2021 model Y, which is insane since the model Y is triple the cost of what I paid for the edge

The big things are, we need the Blindspot light on the side of your mirrors, it’s way more accurate and way more dependable, but most importantly, it’s faster to use that than to look at the screen look at the mirror look out the window look at the screen, etc. before changing lanes, and the Blindspot camera isn’t even that great. Mine are washed out at night so it’s basically unusable if it’s not daytime, The blind spot light is so easy I just don’t get why it’s not there.

The next big thing is rear cross traffic alert we have these nice cameras, but why is there a no cross traffic alert? My Ford Edge would beep and let me know if there was a car coming behind me when I was backing up, the blind spot light on the mirror would also turn on from whatever direction the car behind me is coming from. 

 Why is there no ventilated seats for the model 3 and Y? Again my 2016 Ford edge had that I don’t get why my $60,000 Tesla doesn’t have it.

My Model 3 has that because I got it before autopilot became standard, it works exactly as you would expect it to, and its kind of crazy that there isn't a way to switch to it on the newer cars.

Would also be great to see improvements to wipers. Right now there are times where the auto wipers don't react fast enough and the wiper control still feels dangerous. It has always seemed like there would be an easy way to fix it with the existing controls.

Similarly, I've never been impressed by the auto high beams, and the pop up every time I manually turn them off is kind of annoying.

comment,y407rm,y407rm,,"Cherry-picked criteria in which Tesla does do a good job.  Here's a very different set of criteria:

1. Quality of materials and workmanship.
2. Ease of use of controls and similarity for people moving from ICE vehicles.  (In other words: physical buttons)
3. Ease of installation of home charger for first-time buyers, such as including it with the purchase of the car.
4. Quiet interior.
5. Affordability.

Edit: FWIW, the above are not necessarily my criteria, and are not meant to favor, in aggregate, any one other specific car or maker.  (e.g.  #3 and #5 clearly favor GM, but #4 doesn't.)  They are just alternate criteria.  I have a Nissan Ariya reservation, and am very much looking forward to getting it later this year or early next year.  It also doesn't meet all of these.

1. Had to meet a price point.  ($60K or less)
2. Flat or dolly towable so that I can tow it behind an RV.  This made FWD a hard requirement since there are currently no flat-towable BEVs.
3. Unloaded vehicle weight below 4700 lbs.  (Also for towing it.)
4. Refined, quiet, comfortable, interior.
5. Comfortable and roomy rear seat, preferably with seat heaters.  (I have 3 slim teenage kids.)
6. Decent amount of flat surface area when rear seat is folded down so that RC airplanes will fit reasonably well.  (I fly mainly electric ducted jets.  Another unusual requirement.)

It also seems like Tesla is pretty worried about getting stuck at a 'local maximum' and is taking lots of measures to avoid relying on almost anything except vision for critical decisions. Or at least to have the option to change around their priorities and architecture to get out of a local maximum if they find themselves stuck there.

The 50k car purchase is exactly the kind of thing a upper middle class person would postpone if they’re concerned with the economy and potentially getting laid off. Additionally how many more rich people can buy a new Tesla every year that’s inherently diminishing year after year. I would also argue that the upper class is more likely to stockpile cash and buy appreciating assets during a recession than buy a depreciating one. Making financially smart decisions is probably somewhat correlational with being upper class.

Furthermore with higher interest rates auto loans are more of a risk and with potential defaults lenders will have stricter standards with lending which would reduce the pool of buyers.

Tesla has a massive lead in crashes for level 2 systems, which is what the ""auto pilot"" features on their vehicles fall under.

Waymo has the lead in crashes for the level 3-5 systems, but also has the most advanced fleet currently.

comment,yw85ie,yw85ie,,"Agree with most of your post! I also went from a 2018 X to a 2022 X. 

Range - The faster charging was a huge huge bonus. We had a 75D and never realized how much slower the charging rate was. We recently went on a short road trip with the 2022 and the much improved supercharging speed was a welcomed improvement.

Controls - I got used to the yoke very quickly. While there are some who actually prefer the yoke (from reading reviews), I would have loved to have a regular steering wheel as an option. The biggest drawback, in my opinion, is not having a shifting stalk. Trying to do a three point turn in a small parking garage is not much fun using the 'swipe' shifter. I also really miss using the left and right buttons on the 75D's regular steering wheel - especially the climate controls. I find voice control for the climate can be hit or miss and having to use the centre screen for the majority of climate controls can be dangerous at times.

Build Quality - My particular build was tremendously improved compared to my 2018 75D. The 2018 had trim issues, misaligned doors, unclipped plastic pieces, just to name a few. Our 2022 was pristine. The overall interior build material and quality, while not 'luxurious' per se compared to other luxury brands, is noticeably better.

comment,z4h7mf,z4h7mf,,"From the article: Tesla has finally taken steps to fight back against owners who disregard their warnings and disclaimers and use Autopilot cheat devices to trick the car into thinking their hands are on the wheel.
With the latest release of Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta, the car can now detect if you are using an Autopilot cheat device and initiate a forced Autopilot disengagement, resulting in a strike if it happened while FSD Beta was engaged.

Since Autopilot was introduced, if you did not have your hands on the steering wheel the car would remind (or nag) you to apply force so that it knows you are still there and paying attention.

Tesla has been able to figure this out and your car can now detect when at least some of these devices are being used. According to third-party software tracker Teslascope, this new code was added with the latest FSD Beta 10.69.3.1.
This information has been corroborated by Tesla Service employees.
Tesla obviously didn’t include this new ability in the release notes, and has not officially announced it is there, so we don’t know for sure how they are detecting these devices.

One possibility is that Tesla knows when your hands are off the wheel (no force), and they also know with a high level of confidence when your hands on the wheel (varying force).",1504,True,1669393023.0,2022-11-25 17:17:03,98,0,chrisdh79,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/z4h7mf/tesla_cracks_down_on_autopilot_cheat_devices_as/ixqsad8/,True,,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,ixqsad8

comment,zgy11b,zgy11b,,"Even though public demos like ChatGPT make it seem like we cracked the code, we are still very far from incorporating Deep Learning (""AI"" if you like) into mission-critical systems like self-driving vehicles and automated medical diagnoses. Currently learning algorithms are relatively successful in ""low stakes"" applications like recommender systems and search query completion. If an algorithm makes a mistake and serves you the wrong ad, you probably won't even notice. And even for these low stakes applications, companies like Meta and Google are struggling with unintended outcomes like strongly biased and outright racist outputs of the algorithms. Getting something like ChatGPT to not get tempted by specific user inputs to glorify Hitler is a huge challenge (remember [Tay](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist)). And we're still talking about low stakes applications here; when the stakes go up, like for cancer diagnosis, traffic regulation, and nuclear power plant monitoring, you need to be sure that you can trust the algorithm predictions.

Aside from mischievous users who like to see public chatbots promote antisemitism, there is the almost insurmountable problem of [adversarial attacks](https://venturebeat.com/security/adversarial-attacks-in-machine-learning-what-they-are-and-how-to-stop-them/).",4841,True,1670661921.0,2022-12-10 09:45:21,7,0,GrumpyGeologist,investing,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zgy11b/artificial_intelligence_investment_for_the_next/izn0wmo/,True,,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,izn0wmo

comment,zz8vg9,zz8vg9,,"Good critical analysis, thank you for sharing. I have some comments you could check out if you want:

>The Berlin factory cost around $5b and comes with a capacity of 250k cars.

I think if you look at floor space compared to Shanghai capacity is over 1 million at least, even more for Giga Texas. Don't forget that Shanghai was also guided at 250k capacity. This is because ramping takes infinite time and effort+includes risk, so best to say a low number. Especially in slower ramp rate/permit/anything locations like Germany. Feel free to quantify floorspace and ramp rate etc. if you don't believe. I think terminally Berlin 1.5 million, Texas 2 million or more depending what they place in the building.

>If Tesla wants to increase capacity by 4m units, they need to invest roughly $80b.

Capex per vehicle went down each factory generation, feel free to quantify if you don't believe. If they make a cheaper vehicle I expect significant savings in this aspect also, knowing about gigapress.

>35% in the next 12 months

Time will tell, I see the recession. Perhaps they will have big problems. However, there is also upside if factories in Texas/Berlin ramp, margins improve. And if dollar weakens, or china economy strengthens, china profits increase. Furthermore operating leverage increases the more cars they make.

comment,10sk1gh,10sk1gh,,"Shanghai already has capacity to produce 1.2M today. Eventually they're expecting to reach 1.5M with the newly announced expansion, although that will still take a while.

Berlin and Texas are 3 and 8 times larger than Shanghai will be respectively, so eventually I expect them to do ~2M each. Berlin has already announced to hit 500K with the first of four stages, so that seems in line with my expectation.

I do think both Berlin and Texas will do a lot more than just cars, unlike Shanghai which is purely focused on cars. So that's why I don't expect them to do 3-8x more cars than Shanghai.

Then there's Fremont, which is expected to ramp to 800K over time. So adding all of those together, it's 6.3M cars with zero downtime. I don't expect them to be fully done by 2025, but by that time I do expect some production from one or two unannounced factories as well. Shanghai actually only took 10 months from start of construction to first deliveries, so it is possible in countries with less bureaucracy. In theory Tesla could announce a new factory at Investor Day in March and start production in early 2024 (although I don't expect this).

So in a ""everything goes perfectly"" scenario, 4.8M is a rough estimation of mainly the four existing factories plus maybe some production from 1 or 2 unannounced factories.

comment,11el96v,11el96v,,"Speaking as someone who’s been privy to an actual Tesla benchmarking, the most impressive part of Tesla’s designs have nothing to do with the vehicle’s battery, drivetrain, or  the fact it was “designed to be an EV.”  It has to do with how consolidated and streamlined their controls architecture is, and you can generally tell whether praise of Tesla’s construction is rooted in actual subject matter expertise by whether they spotlight this.

Legacy automakers tend to build every single vehicle subsystem insularly.  That means your dash screen has one control module and wiring harness, each of your powered seats has one, and so on.  Tesla has always consolidated all these functions into only a couple control modules per vehicle, with all outputs being calculated by software and relayed back rather than processed “locally.” Each of these control modules is essentially a miniature computer, so Tesla’s model not only saves a lot of parts (in fact, it is **the** reason why they weathered the chip shortage so well), but makes systems integration leagues easier. 

This is a difference Munro mentions repeatedly during his Tesla teardowns, and the industry has quietly acknowledged is a big deal - everyone is trying to make the same shift now, and several former Tesla controls people have shown up in high positions at legacies.  For Toyota, who has struggled with connectivity and the general increase of tech in cars, that should be of particular focus in benchmarking.",1782,True,1677632462.0,2023-03-01 02:01:02,389,0,TenguBlade,cars,https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/11el96v/toyota_executive_calls_tesla_model_y_truly_a_work/jafd9rx/,True,,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,jafd9rx

But i don't know why you'd do this to a roadster. what you're essentially trying to do is EV convert a car that happens to already be an EV.

There's nothing about the roadster that makes it easier to swap in a model 3 powertrain. In  fact, i'd argue choosing the roadster is actually far more difficult due to the space/chassis constraints of it being such a small vehicle. it would be easier to put the model 3 powertrain into a gas vehicle because you'd be starting from scratch with an easier canvas.

there's companies that make custom replacement batteries specifically for the roadster. energy density has improved, so you can get better range now.

as far as this being frowned upon, there aren't many roadsters out there. they're somewhat collectible now.

Only reason to do this is if you think it's cool to specifically have a supercharging roadster. Some people might be confused (because normally roadsters do not supercharge).

comment,14uirtn,14uirtn,,">5. Beige headliners cheap and don't belong in any cars. Headliners should match the interior of the car and no car should have a beige interior. Just put the extra coloring in and make it tan or go with something else like black.

Manufacturers intentionally make headliners beige in most economy cars and crossovers because it makes them look *significantly* bigger inside and also why a lot of premium sports coupes (my C8 for instance) have black linings becsuse it accentuates that cockpit feel. Selling point for crossovers is the idea of size but economical and a sports car you'd want to relate to a performance machine/fighter jet and that feeling of confinement is synonymous with excitement and speed/rigidity. One of the most cost-effective marketing ploys in the automotive market. 

Using an example, get in a new volvo with the ""bright package"" and the ""dark package"" and they feel SO different. Kind of mind blowing, actually.

* Tesla has been exaggerating the range of its cars, both in advertising and use of deceptive readings on the dash.  
* This has caused thousands of customers per week to initiate service appointments.
* Tesla uses deceptive and heavy handed tactics to try and thwart these service complaints.  They trick customers, cancel their appointments, put flags in the software to block that customer or hide true problems with the vehicle.
* A special Tesla team in Nevada ruthlessly suppresses and stonewalls customer complaints, and celebrates each major deflection of a customer by hitting a musical gong/xylophone.
* Indpendent experts have found varying degrees of inaccuracy or exaggeration in Teslas range claims, far more than any other automaker.
* EPA processes and rules make it hard to hold them accountable.
* Korea is the only place that has really made them accountable, forcing Tesla and Musk himself to make a public admission of their deceitful conduct.
* Some owners and drivers don't understand the things that can affect range, such as driving style and conditions and weather, and use of heating or air conditioning.

* Cars are expensive.  No like REALLY expensive.  Just to put the most basic new car on the road you could possible think of is expensive.  It could easily cost the manufacture $80k/car but read on before you call BS.
* To get this stupid expensive thing cheap you have to sell a lot of them.  So much of the cost is the $2B+ designing, testing and setting up production.  Sell 1m/year and now the same car has a $15k/car cost.
* Funny thing is, when you draw out the venn diagram of new car buyers and those buyers that want a brutally basic car, you don't get enough people so you're back to $80k/car in cost as you can't get the volume you need.  There is no great yearning masses for basic new cars outside the fleet industry.
* Then you realize that adding most features is cheap.  Those ventilated seats you charge $1500 for is just a piece of plastic, a fan and a flex hose to the AC tunnel in the center console.  If you're running power to the seat now, make the seat move with motors for $15 more.  If it moves, add profiles so they move to set positions for each driver.  It goes on.

comment,163mozx,163mozx,,"That does not have anything to do with VW's ownership of Porsche AG which OP is refering to nor the value of VW's stake in it. Porsche SE owns 12.5% of Porsche AG, 12.5% are publically traded, and the remaining 75% belong to Volkswagen AG. 

Volkswagen AG is trading at a discount to their said 75% stake in Porsche AG. 

So basically in buying VW at its current price, in terms of ownership you get all the remaining companies under Volkswagen's roof for free. That being said though, the aforementioned Porsche SE is also trading at about 60% of the value of their stake in Volkswagen AG, so in buying them, you theoretically get an even larger discount.

Historically, there has always been a 40 to 50 percent discount between Porsche SE and Volkswagen, mostly because their leadership is not particularly interested in serving minor shareholder interests and also because selling their stake would obviously massively tank the price.",937,False,1693244606.0,2023-08-28 19:43:26,18,0,Dense_Beach,investing,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/163mozx/volkswagen_extremely_undervalued/jy48p4t/,True,,2023,elon,search,False,False,0,jy48p4t
comment,163mozx,163mozx,,"VW is still insanely profitable. They have a strong brand, solid finances and the ever-lasting support of the German government for being one of the largest employers and tax payers in the country.

So why the low valuation? Basically, the market doesn't much care about the current profits, large as they may be. It cares about future profits and seems to be pessimistic about that.

They sell mostly cars with internal combustion engines. The growth of their EV portfolio is disappointing and feels way too slow considering fast moving competition like Tesla and - arguably more important - Chinese brands.

China has been and still is VW's most important market. But China has developed it's own car industry and in the EV space, its own brands are starting to produce cars that can compete in terms of both price and quality.

This year and for the first time BYD, a Chinese car maker, sold more of its own cars in China than VW. That likely won't be a singular event but rather marks the start of a lasting trend.

I started a VW position in 2016 and am still holding. The dividend yield is nice but I'm starting to have doubts about the future. I would like to see them cut the dividend and use the money to drastically accelerate the EV transition. That will probably not happen as most shareholders would be against it.

I also worry about the many walls of resistance that stand in the way of such a transition in the first place.",1756,True,1693248243.0,2023-08-28 20:44:03,16,0,funny_alias,investing,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/163mozx/volkswagen_extremely_undervalued/jy4igwh/,True,,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,jy4igwh

My immediate reactions are the obvious ones: Why replace such a new car? Why replace a truck with a SUV?

But putting those aside, to address your specific topics:

* IMO, ride quality of the Model X is good, but not as smooth as a high-end luxury vehicle. I keep mine in Sport/Plaid configuration for everything, but frankly the ""comfort"" mode doesn't seem that much different.
* Noise level on the highway seems good, but not as quiet as some other vehicles I've driven. For both ride quality and noise level, the short answer is: better than the Tesla 3 and Y, but not as refined as, say a Mercedes.
* I personally strongly prefer the Tesla nav and UI over CarPlay. While I find CarPlay a life-saving crutch when dealing with inferior infotainment systems from the likes of Stallantis or Toyota, it's really just ""acceptable"" where most OEM software is ""completely unacceptable."" CarPlay is slow (even when wired and on a fast phone, it's the timing of animations, not the smoothness), cartoony, and has pretty bad UX design overall.
* Seat comfort is great, IMO. Nice side bolstering and synthetic seat material.
* Cabin size is good. Plenty of room inside.
* I use FSD Beta, so I can't comment on Enhanced Autopilot.
* Other stuff: The performance is thoroughly insane and fun; it never gets old.

In practice, i only need FC when i drive more than 425 km (winter 375 km) in one freeway stretch. I mostly charge with AC chargers. I sometimes drive 600+ km a day for work, with only AC charge stop(s) in between. Works well.

Rule of thumb i use is: 1 hour freeway drive, 2 hrs AC (11 kW) charging. When there are AC chargers, and you stay long enough at a place, you charge enough as well. In theory, i could live like 425 km from work. Drive to it, charge at work, make a workday, and drive 425 km back. Making 850 km a day without using a fast charger.

Edit: It's interesting to see downvotes, people who dislike a reality call ig? My 2 years / >70k km disproves that i need a petrol/diesel car. Or that i need FCs everywhere.",1055,False,1695294190.0,2023-09-21 13:03:10,5,0,DD4cLG,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16obp0z/proper_builtin_charger_routing_while_navigating/k1jppt3/,True,,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,k1jppt3

If a customer chooses not to activate upfront, after their complimentary trial they can choose an annual plan for $800 or a monthly plan for $75.

comment,171qtir,171qtir,,"Congratulations on your new Xpeng G9! It's undoubtedly a good-looking car and represents the significant advancements in electric vehicle technology coming out of China.  
However, when it comes to Chinese cars, I do have some reservations. Supporting the regime is one thing, and I have some paranoia on privacy with the car being full of mics and apps. I mean, [if Tesla is listening/looking...](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-workers-shared-sensitive-images-recorded-by-customer-cars-2023-04-06/) Another concern is the availability of parts outside of China. Depending on where you're located, sourcing replacements can be a challenge, potentially leaving your car unusable for extended periods should something break or fail. I heard of BYD and Hongqi owners who's been waiting for months for a new tail light or charging ports.  
Furthermore, payload capacity is another factor to consider as mentioned by a fellow norwegian in this thread. Many vehicles from the region tend to offer lower payload limits. The G9 is rated just over 300 kg, which is ridiculous in a car this size.

As is typical with most National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recalls and Tesla, the company has already fixed the issue through a free OTA software update.

According to the recall document posted to the NHTSA [website](https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2022/TESLA/MODEL%252520X#recalls), the issue was first discovered in several Model X vehicles in September 2023, where a visual indicator for low brake fluid was not functioning. The Brakes Integration team initiated an investigation between September 19 and September 27, during which they examined sensor data, performed tests to confirm the issue, and assessed design specifications to identify the root cause.

On September 27, the team determined that an incorrect setting in the vehicle controller’s threshold range was causing the problem. Just one day later, on September 28, Tesla initiated an OTA software update to correct the issue. Tesla says as of October 10, 2023, there have been no reported crashes, injuries, or deaths related to this issue.

The OTA update that corrected the issue was 2023.32.7 or later, a non FSD Beta branch.

You can have a physical control center full of buttons with a minimalist design. Check out Critroen CX for example, with the two satellites on the sides of the single fucking arm steering wheel (just beautiful).

You can have a fully functional 'minimalist' design by reducing ornaments or a purely aesthetic design, but if you reduce functionalities at the same time as ergonomics IT IS ANOTHER THING.

comment,17mj9vb,17mj9vb,,"Not using LiDAR, when every other higher rated self-driving car does, is not smart.

Self driving is largely only possible with cameras/software for virtual AND physical sensors like LiDAR. Tesla removed RADAR even but that is more problematic than LiDAR, both are better than just computer vision for virtual object detection.

If they used LiDAR they could detect stationary objects. This would have been no problem for LiDAR 300+ yards out.

Computer vision will always be able to be fooled by 2d vision without physical 3d checks.

Tesla's don't have physical depth checking. They are trying to do everything with computer vision that is affected by weather, light, debris, dirt, and unknowns in their detection. It is why their lead AI guy left, it is an impossible feat without physical depth checking (LiDAR).

comment,17pyld0,17pyld0,,"I live in Florida and have been watching the stories of Teslas catching fire here.

*Yes*, Teslas are relatively water tight, and can be used as a ""submarine"" *to an extent*.

The last few hurricanes we've had always tend to end with people who own a Tesla, and drove through water with it, catching fire.

When a hurricane comes through, it is pulling salt water from the gulf, or the Atlantic, and dropping it into the state.

This means that when people are escaping hurricanes and opt to drive through puddles and such, post hurricane, in a lot of cases those puddles might in fact have salt water in them.

So, there's a belief that *yes*, a Tesla can be driven through water puddles, and relatively deep ones at that, *however*, you should try to avoid salt water.

In watching the video that accompanies the article, the dude states that the Model X ended up in the water at the Polk St boat launch ramp in Hollywood, FL.  Presumably that's [this spot](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Boat+Ramp/@26.014335,-80.1216065,1410m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x88d9ab15ec85a6cf:0x90c31d1582f5030e!8m2!3d26.0142556!4d-80.1215358!16s%2Fg%2F11bx1ycql2?entry=ttu)

The video raised some great points about water being pulled in, but it simply isn't the only reason why Model 3's AC system tends to stink...",636,False,1699555281.0,2023-11-09 19:41:21,69,0,xtremepsionic,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/17rbaba/this_design_flaw_makes_teslas_model_3_smell_bad/k8jbnh4/,True,,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,k8jbnh4

comment,17ws4f6,17ws4f6,,"Tesla has removed its threat to hit flippers of its Cybertruck with a potential $50,000 lawsuit and other measures, a day after it made headlines.

Tesla plans to start deliveries of the Cybertruck electric pickup on Nov. 30 and has started telegraphing that volumes will be limited, meaning early owners will likely be able to make a profit by reselling the highly anticipated vehicle.

To help prevent this, Tesla on Monday added a paragraph relating specifically to the Cybertruck in the terms and conditions section of the sales agreement buyers need to sign when purchasing a vehicle from the company, which stated that the buyer agrees to not resell the electric truck for at least one year after taking delivery, or face some consequences, including potentially a lawsuit.

By Tuesday, that paragraph was no longer included in the sales agreement. It likely means owners will be able to resell their Cybertrucks without Tesla coming after them, though the company could always reinstate the policy or something similar once the Cybertruck is actually on the market.",1072,False,1700154784.0,2023-11-16 18:13:04,1,0,Khalbrae,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/17ws4f6/tesla_backtracks_on_cybertrucks_resale_threat/k9ivuro/,True,,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,k9ivuro

comment,181i3nl,181i3nl,,"What Tesla is doing is killing the competition and flooding the market with Tesla's and creating long-term advantages.

Look at how these other ICE automakers are decreasing investments in EV. Once they realize they can't compete with Tesla on pricing and have to further reduce investments into EV because of how much of a loss-leader they are, they'll be so behind that Tesla would have a huge advantage.

Yes, in an ideal world, Tesla should stop cutting prices. But with the rates and an uncertain economy, it's tough to convince people to pay the same prices for Tesla vehicles as they were a year or two ago. If the rates were lower, Tesla wouldn't have to drop the prices as much as they have.

comment,181kfjw,181kfjw,,"• The world-first strike against Tesla began in Sweden when a group of 130 disgruntled mechanics had their request for a collective bargaining agreement rejected. 

• As is customary in Sweden, where sector-specific collective agreements cover nearly 90% of the country’s workforce, unions in other sectors came out in solidarity. 

• Dockworkers, mail and delivery workers, cleaners and car painters have so far all agreed to refuse to work with Tesla products. Stockholm’s largest taxi company has also stopped buying new Tesla cars for its fleet. 

• The opposition to Tesla’s anti-union business model could now spread to Germany, where Tesla runs factories and has a significantly larger workforce. The powerful German union IG Metall has said that it is ready to launch collective bargaining negotiations if the workers demand it.

&nbsp;

• Foreign and domestic tech giants have tried to challenge the Swedish system, but these attempts are now more likely to backfire. 

• The financial tech company Klarna recently had to give way after several years of attempting to resist collective bargaining agreements, and there is increasing pressure on Spotify to do the same.

• In an interview, Susanna Gideonsson, who heads the Swedish trade union federation fighting Tesla, sounded remarkably confident. “This will end with the employees winning a collective bargaining agreement, one way or another,” she said. And if they don’t? “Then Tesla can leave the country.",1662,True,1700690724.0,2023-11-22 23:05:24,170,0,marketrent,technology,https://reddit.com/r/technology/comments/181kfjw/tesla_may_have_picked_an_unwinnable_fight_with/kacy3hy/,True,,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,kacy3hy

btw this is to compensate for lost retirement transfers. So it is in reality 100% compensation. Salary + retirement money.

And the unions say they have enough money for be paying this if so the conflict lasts 500 years (!). So the strikers have zero incentives to end the strike and IF Metall have zero incentives to end the strike (They have more than enough money to go on and this is a big chance to show that they actually help the members. Great commerical for the union).

Tesla will not win this. No way.

They might get out of Sweden. But they also might get that this conflict spreads to other European markets with unions....and oh boy..then they are in big trouble..

comment,184oplo,184oplo,,"“They deliver components to Tesla’s factory in Berlin, and if this causes disruption to them we hope to force them back to the negotiation table,” said IF Metall negotiation secretary Veli-Pekka Saikkala, adding Hydro Extrusions was the only supplier of the components in Europe.

IF Metall, Sweden’s biggest manufacturing union, is locked in a fight with Tesla to get a collective bargaining agreement for its 130 mechanics in Sweden. Metall put the mechanics on strike on Oct. 27, refusing to service Tesla’s cars.

Since then, the mechanics have been joined by members of other unions such as postal workers, dockworkers, cleaners and others who refuse to work with Tesla or its products.

Saikkala said the union was prepared to ramp up the conflict if Tesla refused to sign.

             “This fight is very, very important. It’s so important that we cannot let it go. It’s important for us but also for the 
               whole Swedish labour market,” he said.

We don’t have any minimum wages or laws for when you can and cannot work in Sweden. We have frameworks and employment protection, but apart from that, it is collective bargaining agreements that regulate the labour market,” said Torbjorn Johansson, negotiation secretary at LO, the union umbrella organization.

                  Around 90% of all employees in Sweden are covered by collective bargaining agreements, which regulates wages,

Danish dockworkers and drivers are threatening to stop transporting Teslas to neighboring Sweden if the carmaker does not reach a deal with striking Swedish workers within two weeks.

Denmark’s 3F labor union said the planned “sympathy strike” is aimed at putting extra pressure on a Tesla (TSLA) subsidiary to recognize Swedish labor union IF Metall, which would enable collective bargaining over wages and other terms of employment.

It is the first time a labor union outside of Sweden has threatened industrial action against Tesla in solidarity with the Swedish workers.

                This is about good wages, good pensions and good insurance for all our members who work at Tesla,” IF Metall said on its website.
                We have been negotiating with Tesla for a long time.     They have refused to sign a collective agreement and 
                 violate basic principles in the Swedish labor market.”

On Tuesday, the spokesperson for Denmark’s 3F, said its dockworkers and drivers would not handle Teslas destined for Sweden, referring to “speculation” that the carmaker would try to circumvent the Swedish port blockade by shipping its vehicles to Danish ports for onward delivery via truck.

Such a workaround “is no longer possible,” the union spokesperson said.",1800,True,1701830467.0,2023-12-06 03:41:07,6,0,BikkaZz,business,https://reddit.com/r/business/comments/18btp61/teslas_clash_with_swedish_workers_risks_spilling/kc6e9me/,True,,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,kc6e9me

comment,18hqkxn,18hqkxn,,"WASHINGTON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) is recalling over 2 million vehicles in the U.S. to install new safeguards in its Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system, after a federal safety regulator cited safety concerns.

The largest-ever Tesla recall appears to cover nearly all vehicles on U.S. roads to better ensure drivers pay attention when using the system. Tesla's recall filing said that Autopilot's software system controls ""may not be sufficient to prevent driver misuse"" and could increase the risk of a crash.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has spent over two years investigating whether vehicles produced by the electric automaker led by billionaire Elon Musk adequately ensure drivers pay attention.

Acting NHTSA Administrator Ann Carlson praised Tesla for agreeing to the recall. ""One of the things we determined is that drivers are not always paying attention when that system is on,"" she said at a U.S. House hearing.

Carlson said the agency opened a safety probe in August 2021 when she kept hearing about fatal crashes involving use of Autopilot. ""My immediate response was, 'We have to do something about this,'"" she said.

Separately, Transport Canada said Tesla will recall 193,000 vehicles to address the Autopilot issue.

I don't think that's true? The first I saw was on roads around their office, with a guy in the seat not touching the wheel, with obviously a dev build and a common environment.

> still not producing any really impressive results

What. FSD is the way ahead of anyone else. They are the only ones actually trying to make autonomous driving work on _all_ roads with a generalist approach. They have proven this is a very hard problem but they have also proven they're ahead others solving it. A competitor would need the equal of the FSD chip to avoid lugging around 3-10 GPUs worth of cargo taking multiple kW's. This is also a good part of the reason I invested in TSLA before they blew up after Autonomy Day as I saw how they were ahead, and nothing has really proven that point untrue, just that they were optimistic in the scale of the challenge this kind of tech has against infinitely unique real life RNG.

About FSD fitting the robot, Tesla has pointed out the work they are doing translates very well to Optimus. It would be a bit silly to even have it otherwise.

In a move that fuels excitement and potential, Tesla has set its sights on producing energy-storage batteries right here in the Middle Kingdom.  
>  
>The stage was set in Shanghai, where a signing ceremony for land acquisition took place. With construction slated to begin early next year, the factory is expected to be up and running by the end of the year. This isn't just any factory, though. It's a powerhouse dedicated solely to the production of energy-storage batteries for electric utilities and other companies. We're talking about units that store power generated by renewable sources like solar and wind energy. It's a game-changer for a world in need of eco-friendly solutions.

>With the rise in renewable energy sources comes the need for a reliable and efficient method of storing the power they generate. The Tesla factory in China seeks to address this challenge by churning out 10,000 Megapack units annually. These energy storage systems will be made available not just in China, but across the globe.

 is recalling more than 120,000 vehicles over doors that fail to comply with U.S. government regulations.

              National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website Thursday, Tesla acknowledged the affected doors can be unlocked 
             during a crash, which could cause the door to unlatch and open, increasing the risk of injury.

As a remedy, Tesla is releasing an over-the-air (OTA) software update free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be sent out Feb. 17, 2024.

Last week, Tesla announced a recall for nearly all its U.S. vehicles — some 2 million — due to concerns about the safety of its autopilot driver-assistance feature. A federal investigation found that its autosteer function may have led some drivers to abandon responsibility for the operation of their vehicles.

That recall came after one in February affecting more than 360,000 vehicles related to Tesla's ""full self-driving"" software.”

comment,1adgztd,1adgztd,,"This guy talks about the future like it's guaranteed. How many times have Elon musk over promised and under delivered?

Your big growth driver for Tesla is energy? That's not a very high growth industry, with fairly low profit margins. It's not a luxury item. You cannot overcharge for it. Furthermore, unlike software, it's constrained by physical factors, like how fast can you install your equipment, and margins are cut down by materials and labor costs. 

The only way for Tesla to grow is to move away from selling goods like cars and solar and batteries to selling software. That's the only reason why we view it as a tech company, because it can scale with software without physical bottleneck.

comment,1c7y80h,1c7y80h,,"By Brian Barrett

Tesla’s Cybertruck has been widely derided. Its panel gaps are wide and amateurish, it’s prone to rust, and it looks like an ergonomic cheese grater. Its most serious flaw to date, though, has resulted in a recall of nearly 4,000 vehicles.

The US National Highway Traffic Safety Association has recalled 3,878 Cybertrucks, which comprises any that were manufactured between November 13 of last year and April 4. At issue is the accelerator pedal: Its pad can become dislodged, resulting in the pedal becoming trapped in the trim above it. This is, needless to say, quite bad.

comment,1cpugu7,1cpugu7,,"To be honest, recycling water from a factory is already very environmentally conscious, and I think most assembly sites do not care that much about that.

And I am really wondering how much this story about water usage is serious in Berlin: this city got 600mm of rainfall, spread-out evenly around the year. The region  is forest and lakes. I think a lot of people misunderstand the probably likely need for upgrade of the local water supply for the factory (as the factory was built in a rural  area) with the fact it threatens water reserves in the region, which seems a presposterous claim for me.

comment,1cy11te,1cy11te,,"By Andy Greenberg

In a video shared with WIRED, researchers at the Beijing-based automotive cybersecurity firm GoGoByte demonstrated that they could carry out a relay attack against the latest Tesla Model 3 despite its upgrade to an ultra-wideband keyless entry system, instantly unlocking it with less than a hundred dollars worth of radio equipment. Since the Tesla 3's keyless entry system also controls the car's immobilizer feature designed to prevent its theft, that means a radio hacker could start the car and drive it away in seconds—unless the driver has enabled Tesla's optional, off-by-default PIN-to-drive feature that requires the owner to enter a four-digit code before starting the car.

---------------------

@elonmusk has been the key driver of AI and autonomy at Tesla. He has always pushed us to achieve great things, even when such ideas were seemingly impossible at the time. Some examples:

Back in 2014, Autopilot started on a ridiculously tiny computer that only had ~384 KB of memory and puny compute (didn't even have native floating point arithmetic). He asked the engineering team to implement lane keeping, lane changing, longitudinal control for vehicles, curvature, etc. Many, even in the team, thought that the request was crazy. Nonetheless, he never gave up and pushed the team to achieve this very difficult goal. In 2015, beyond all odds, Tesla shipped the world's first Autopilot system. The second closest such product only came to market many years later.

In 2016, Tesla started doing all of the computer vision required for Autopilot in-house instead of depending on external vendors. Many people thought it was insane to bet the product on developing the vision system from scratch within a few months, which had taken other companies a decade or more. Yet, we achieved this target within eleven months. This was a strategically important move that started the development of a strong AI team at Tesla.

Not only did he push for strong AI software, but also for powerful AI hardware. Tesla, which others thought was just a car company, was making custom silicon to run neural networks efficiently.",3884,True,1717933621.0,2024-06-09 13:47:01,82,0,twinbee,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/1dbrv8e/tesla_aiap_software_head_ashok_elluswamy_comments/l7swqe0/,True,,2024,both,search,False,False,0,l7swqe0

comment,1dmncys,1dmncys,,">The child was safely removed from the car after firefighters used an ax to smash through a window. But the issue raises concerns about why there isn’t an easy way to open the car from the outside when its 12-volt battery — the one that powers things like its door locks and windows — loses power.
>
>The car’s owner, Renee Sanchez, was taking her granddaughter to the zoo, but after loading the child in the Model Y, she closed the door and wasn’t able to open it again. “My phone key wouldn’t open it,” Sanchez said in an interview with Arizona’s Family. “My car key wouldn’t open it.” She called emergency services, and firefighters were dispatched to help.
>
>It is possible to open doors in a Model Y if you’re inside the vehicle when it has no power; there’s a latch to open a front door and a cable to open a back door. But that wasn’t an option for the young child, who was buckled into their car seat while Sanchez was stuck outside the car. You can jump-start a dead Tesla to be able to get into it, but it can be a complex process.

I'm glad that the person had the presence of mind to call emergency services, and that there ultimately was a solution to get the toddler out of the vehicle in the Arizona sun. This raises some of the issues around the reliance on electrical systems for more basic functions like doors though. Electronics are nice to have, but it's also useful to have a mechanical or manual way to operate critical equipment and the like.",1467,False,1719153034.0,2024-06-23 16:30:34,5103,0,Hrmbee,technology,https://reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1dmncys/arizona_toddler_rescued_after_getting_trapped_in/l9wo7gn/,True,,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,l9wo7gn

Tesla energy is surging.

The products that are trying to compete with them more often than not, without being specific, have unfortunately replicated the package, the shape, the overall proportion of the vehicle, such that they’re not a Tesla-branded vehicle, but the side view centerline of the vehicle is almost identical to a Model Y. The seating package is within millimeters of a Model Y, the performance is slightly worse than a Model Y.

>Ironically, because of the Model Y’s success, you have a lot of incumbents that have built products that look and feel and are shaped a lot like a Model Y. That’s very different from the internal combustion space where you have hundreds of choices, lots of brands, lots of variety of form factors. What we’ve witnessed over the last few years is because of lack of choice, we’ve had a lot of customers that have gone to one single brand and have had to have a lot of elasticity of their form factor desires. So maybe they wanted a true SUV and got a very car-like crossover with the Model Y. Maybe they wanted something that was a little bit bigger, but they got something that was more like the Model Y.

comment,15n1sl5,15n1sl5,,"Hello, fellow car enthusiasts,

After over a year (since March 2023) and approximately 16,000 kilometers (10,000 miles) of driving my Mercedes EQS 580, I feel compelled to share my experiences and some unexpected insights. For full disclosure, I opted for nearly all available upgrades except for the heated windshield and the silk-like interior roof lining, which seemed superfluous for my needs. I even splurged on a pink gold-plated key to almost max out the options.

Despite agreeing with many observations already noted in this subreddit, I’d like to offer some detailed perspectives on the everyday use of the EQS and how it compares to its competitors.

**Initial Considerations and Competitors:**  
Initially, my heart was set on acquiring either a Porsche Taycan 4S or an Audi E-tron GT RS. My plan was to test the EQS merely to confirm my disinterest, ensuring I had considered all viable options fairly. The Porsche Taycan 4S, despite its allure, fell short during a test drive due to its cramped interior and less responsive touch screens, prompting me to return it prematurely. The Audi e-Tron GT RS was next, offering an exhilarating two-day drive that showcased its impressive power and handling. However, its limited range and the irresistible urge to floor the pedal made it impractical for daily commutes, leading to unwelcome attention from law enforcement.

**Why EQS Stood Out:**  
Surprisingly, the EQS 580 proved to be an underdog.",3950,True,1721907145.0,2024-07-25 13:32:25,5,0,Ok-Driver-9791,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/15n1sl5/my_eqs_sedan_long_term_review/leusz9u/,True,,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,leusz9u

The problem is better known among the Tesla enthusiast community as the ""whompy wheel"" problem, and NHTSA's ODI found hundreds of separate incidents of front suspension failures affecting both Model S sedans and Model X SUVs.

Although the automaker had previously issued a service bulletin to replace the faulty components on some cars, NHTSA says many more vehicles are fitted with the bad parts, and the bulletin should be expanded.

NHTSA began its preliminary evaluation in November 2020 following 43 reports of left or right front suspension fore link failures in model year 2015–2017 Model S and 2016–2017 Model X electric vehicles. Most of these happened at low speeds while parking, and only four occurred at highway speeds.

Tesla actually issued a service bulletin in 2017 to replace the front suspension fore links in some vehicles if either the left or right fore link was damaged or if the vehicle was due for an alignment.

comment,1fyyqdr,1fyyqdr,,"Yeah I can provide some color on the 2024 Model 3 after owning it for about a month. I have the LR RWD, which has an EPA rated range of 363 miles. I usually get around 350 miles with a mix of around 40% city driving and 60% highway driving. For highway driving, this is mostly at 65-75 mph. I am also in the SF Bay Area, so its usually not too warm and I am not blasting the AC (except this past week because of the heat wave haha).

The range will suffer if you are in a colder climate, a very hot climate, or you drive over 80 mph because of drag. I think if you take a 90% haircut of the EPA range then you should get roughly \~320 miles per fillup.

Nobody has clearance to run fully autonomous cars on the road. There are some companies who have some clearance to run some cars and they are reporting back good data. But that's all based on lidar systems, not just camera based. The roll out will have to take this in consideration and this is not a technological step but a governance one. This will take considerable time.

Beyond that, these cars will need charging, which might be inductive sure but that still needs infrastructure which needs to be built out. Since there is no single station built anywhere.

Then you have to think about the hygiene within the car, both in terms of actual hygiene, but also gravity and misuse by the public. This will need operational staff too. 

This is where the waymo roll out is a lot more sensible, especially the partnership with a company like Uber who does have infrastructure and operational staff in most mayor cities or the capacity to scale.

And even if you were to fix all of those issues you'd also be activating a lot of latent demand for mobility, there is a reason you need a license to run a taxi in NYC otherwise it would be even more gridlocked than it is today.

>his latest Model 3 uses acoustic glass all around, and combined with other sound-suppressing measures, achieves a 70-mph cruising sound level of 67 decibels—only one decibel higher than a Mercedes EQS450 that costs more than twice as much—and a dramatic three decibels quieter than the last Model 3 we tested.

While 3 dB is a huge improvement in cabin noise (decibel is logarithmic, not linear), it's actually surprising how loud the Mercedes is. My i4 got 64dB from the [same C&D test](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a40743000/2022-bmw-i4-edrive40-by-the-numbers/), and the BMW iX got [63 dB](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a39983612/2022-bmw-ix-tested-interior-sound-highway-range/).

> The 363-mile EPA range translates into 310 miles in our 75-mph highway-range test, which is an impressive gain from earlier Model 3s. 

75mph with 300 miles+ range is seriously impressive for this segment. My old Model 3 could barely hit 250 under the same condition. This in combination with the Supercharger network would make a lot of long distance trips much more viable than with other EVs.

> Other than its great ride and quiet cabin, the most impressive thing about this latest Model 3 is the price. The base sticker for this rear-drive long-range model is $44,130.

This specifically includes parts produced and sourced from the US and Canada for 2025 models.

Let’s take a look at just how American Tesla’s vehicles are. 

The vast majority of Tesla’s part content is produced within the US and Canada. Tesla holds a tie for first place with Honda. The Model 3 Long Range AWD and RWD are in first place alongside the Honda Ridgeline AWD TrailSport, with 75% of their parts being created in North American.

Tesla also ties for second place at 70% with the Model 3 Performance and Model Ys, alongside a good chunk of Honda’s other vehicles.

The Model S and Model X are closely following at 65% and 60% respectively.

comment,1gjgc5a,1gjgc5a,,"I've had a twin motor ultra EX30 for about 5 months now. The best description for it is ""great to drive, shit to use"".

My previous car was a 1.2L 3 cylinder turbo automatic (Opel Mokka 2021) that was absolute shit to drive but very decent to use. I had some buttons for climate control, I had android auto, I had a decent steering wheel (buttons wise), a remote with actual buttons, working keyless entry, etc.

Now in the Volvo it's amazing to drive but soooo fucking annoying to interface with. The remote has no buttons and sometimes keyless entry doesn't work and the trunk doesn't have a kick sensor and there's a RFID sensor (tesla like) only on the driver's side door. 

The steering wheel has no Mute or Answer Call buttons. The Volume UP button also works as an OK key so if you have anything on the screen that needs confirmation you can't turn the volume down until you OK / Volume up the notification.

There some many dumb choices like this (some fixable by software, some not) but 99% of the EX30 usability problems could have been solved with a better steering wheel (and a HUD). I was looking at a Hyundai Inster review and the fucker has a drive mode button like a Porsche on the steering wheel and scroll wheels and rocker switches.

comment,1gmp923,1gmp923,,"The most common cause is that with EVs your inputs need to be smoother than ICEVs. Teslas have one pedal driving, so when you remove your foot from the accelerator you get immediate braking instead of coasting like in an (automatic) petrol car. That abruptness in a Tesla or other EV causes motion sickness for a lot of people. To prevent it you have to be gradual with taking your foot off the accelerator pedal. Another reason could be pressing the pedal too abruptly so that your acceleration is uncomfortable. Again, being smoother on the pedal helps. A third reason could be the lack of drivetrain noise.

Alright.

People keep trying to post this, so I'm going to add some comments, lock the post, and redirect future posts about this to here.

These articles are all referencing an iSeeCars ""analysis"".

Lars Moravy, the VP of Vehicle Engineering has [this to say](https://x.com/larsmoravy/status/1860100416819855492) regarding the iSeeCars survey.

> Fatal accidents are tragic - we aim to avoid them, safety 1st. This math is incorrect - crash test data is real; Teslas are among the safest cars. Maybe a bad denominator in the per mile calc, by end 2022, US MY miles driven >7B, M3 ~19B. iSeecars=clickbait - not safety regulator

The NHTSA FARS data in question can be found here: https://www.nhtsa.gov/file-downloads?p=nhtsa/downloads/FARS/

Specifically you'd drill down to a year [like 2018](https://www.nhtsa.gov/file-downloads?p=nhtsa/downloads/FARS/2018/National/) and download the ""FARS2018NationalCSV.zip"" file.

In that ZIP file is a CSV named ""Vehicle.csv"", as you can probably imagine, this contains all the vehicle data.  This file contains VIN, Vehicle make, model, location of accident, fatalities, etc, etc.  What it does **not** have is any indication of **mileage** at the time of the accidents.

Any big catch here? I read the page, but don't see anything too crazy? Recap below:

*With a lease buyout, you can purchase your vehicle at the end of the lease. Starting November 27, 2024, all leased vehicles are eligible for purchase.*

*Eligibility*

* *Starting November 27, 2024, all leased Cybertruck, Model S, Model 3, Model X and Model Y vehicles are eligible for purchase.*
* *A purchase fee of up to $350 applies to all vehicles.*

  
Is it as simple as you just pay for the remainder balance due, or you pay for the entire car (aka your lease payments before don't count towards it). Also if you're limited to X miles per year, if you hit that in like 6 months, can you keep driving, go over the miles and just purchase the car, no fees?

comment,1h1l03m,1h1l03m,,"If you still have time remaining on your lease, you have to pay the gross capitalized cost, minus the principal portion of your payments made, and the cap cost reduction. This is pretty standard for a lease.

If you buy out at the end of the term, you pay the residual value of the vehicle. This is what Tesla determines your vehicle to be worth three years into the future within the mileage limitations of your lease. That value is set ahead of time when you sign your lease and is a line item in the agreement - typically there is no negotiating this number (manufacturers set it at certain percentages off of MSRP; for instance, the residual value of my Kia EV9 is 50% of MSRP).

Some residual values on Teslas can be pretty high. There are posts in the Tesla subs showing residuals as high as 68%. Obviously you can get a used one much cheaper than that.

Depending on market conditions, you can really make out or not. The great thing is you don’t have to buy out - you can just turn it in and buy a used one at now market prices if your residual value doesn’t work out.

***Edit: Realized I should probably define some of these terms!***

**Gross capitalized cost** (GCC): the agreed upon value of the vehicle at the start of the lease. This is not the MSRP - its the negotiated price of the vehicle.

**Principal portion**: the part of your payment that goes towards paying down the value of the lease, not interest (interest is called the ""money factor"" in lease agreements).",1594,True,1732762113.0,2024-11-28 03:48:33,64,0,mb10240,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1h1l03m/for_the_first_time_ever_tesla_has_officially/lzcjfwz/,True,,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,lzcjfwz

comment,1h4063m,1h4063m,,"Tesla has a P/E rating of almost 100.

That means the company needs to grow 6x to be worth its current valuation.  
Since that will take time and you want return on your investment during that time, it will need to grow much more actually. So say 10x in 15 years. If tesla grows 10x in 15 years that would make it worth its valuation.

Now it MAY actually do that, but it is highly uncertain. Its robotaxis will not be the only ones on the market and they will have to compete both against other robot taxis and against private car ownership and self driving. The home assistance robots may fail entirely. Point is, it is uncertain. So we need to estimate an EV of the range of possible outcomes and then it still needs to be worth its valuation. There is some chance they will go broke, there is some chance they wont grow very much because part of their endeavours prove to be a failure or because some chinese competetor does everything they do but cheaper and yes there is some chance they will sell their robots and robotaxi's to the entire world. Now if that last chance is say 35%, that means in that scenario it wouldn't need to grow 10x but 30x in 15 years.

I hope you are starting to see why it is very hard to justify a P/E100 ratio for any company.

>That leaves TSMC and its upcoming investment at 2nm and 16A, which is a challenge for ASML for three reasons. First, there is the aforementioned shift in TSMC’s model; repurposing equipment likely means fewer lithography orders. Second, while ASML may have a monopoly on advanced lithography, TSMC is poised to have monopsony power in terms of being able to actually make money on processes that utilize ASML’s advanced lithography, which may depress prices (this is the third factor that could help TSMC’s margins). The third challenge is that we are past peak lithography.

From Doug O’Laughlin at [Fabricated Knowledge](https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/earnings-tsmc-asml-aehr-telecom):

>Another way to interrupt this statement is that EUV intensity is peaked if they think the DUV attach rate is growing as fast as EUV. This has been a long time coming, and Applied Materials puts it well in this slide – 3nm is the apex of lithography market share gains. This is not good for ASML and the EUV story.

comment,1hp84q6,1hp84q6,,"Alright, since some people like to be an asshole instead of answering like a normal human being, here’s my answer based on my personal experience. Buying at an all-time high raises eyebrows for some, but if you’re investing in a company with strong fundamentals, who cares? I don’t worry about MSFT’s price, I invest monthly regardless. There’s a well-known quote: “I don’t buy stocks, I buy companies.” Personally, I’m focused on accumulating shares and adding more to the companies and ETFs I believe in. More shares, bigger returns in the long run. If MSFT drops 20%, that’s a 20% discount on future financial freedom.

Now, if you’re out there chasing hot stocks at an all-time high because of FOMO, well, that’s on you. But if the company is solid, don’t sweat it. Prices fluctuate, sure, but eventually, they tend to climb back and hit new highs.

For those still uncertain, stop banging your head against the wall and stick to ETFs. Companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are solid, wide-moat businesses. Unless some major negative news breaks, there’s no reason to panic about the price.

That said, I’d be cautious with Tesla. It’s a volatile stock, highly sensitive to news, and that unpredictability can lead to some headaches.

comment,1hpnnfc,1hpnnfc,,"Aerodynamics will start to noticeably affect your fuel economy at around 50 mph. Above 60 mph, the effect is even more pronounced. Granted that Teslas have very good design to reduce this effect, but you will lose more range than you think once you’re above 60. 

AAA did a study and found that a Toyota Prius, for example, got 58 mpg at 60 mph but only 47.5 mpg at 70 mph. A Ford F150 got 24 mpg going 60 mph, but only 19.4 mpg at 70.

Speed is not the only factor at play here. Acceleration affects range too and even climate control settings will nudge your efficiency down. 

Also, the range estimates are based on a particular style of driving. I’m not sure what algorithms are used in the Tesla software to determine range, but EPA range estimates are based on 20 mph with multiple stops for city driving and 48 mph for highway. This results in numbers that can be up to 30% off real world results. 

You stated that you’re driving 80% of the trip at 80 mph.

According to pretty much all of Reddit, CO2 emissions are going to kill us all.  Even leaving out the more extreme way of framing this, CO2 emissions already kill a lot of people each year.  So EVs are a way to make an immense difference and fairly quickly.

If you follow space news, you might know that we have a few close calls with big space rocks over the next few years.  And there are probably more we do not even know about.  And we have so many neato ways to wipe ourselves out; Putin threatens us with one of them on a daily basis.  So I would think it is a no-brainer that we need to spread out more to prevent a ""one and done"" scenario.  That is such a clear case of saving humanity, I do not know how to engage with someone who does not see it.  It would be like trying to convince someone that the sky is not, as they keep claiming, a brilliant shade of neon brown. (There's a joke within a joke there, if you can find it :) )

There's Starlink which is probably changing more lives for the better right now than any other single project.

Then there is Neuralink.  Despite the more broken people of Reddit's claims, this project is successful and helping people right now go from being completely jailed within their own bodies to being able to interact with the world again.

The lefts main argument is that he is an unelected official affecting government policy (ie not confirmed by the senate). These actions are causing government agencies to be shuddered and public funding to be slashed at local communities (ie departments of education, department that funds public libraries, parks and wildlife, etc). 

There are plenty of counter arguments, my first being that there are articles that allow private citizens to give goods and services to government for free (like software and service), which is what Elon is doing, to identify waste and fraud in many agencies. So, essentially they have circumvented Elon being confirmed by the senate. This is good because this allows the government to allow quickly without being bogged down by the swamp of judges, media, and politics. 

I believe if people spent some time listening to other viewpoints and understood the goal of this administration, while also listening to the other side, they would be more inclined to cheer the wins and still be honest enough to point out the short comings (which there have been). 

Podcasts that have been great lately are especially Gavin Newsons new pod, listening to Tim Walz speak, Bernie and AOC rallies, All In podcast especially episodes with Lutnick and Bessent, Chris Cuomo, and Bill Maher.

>Some Tesla drivers appeared to have reported similar issues in online forums and in videos that showed the vehicle recognizing the red light but driving ahead. One YouTuber showed how the Tesla first came to a stop at a red light and then continued driving before the light changed.

You can DC fast charge at other public chargers like Electrify America, EVGo, Ionna, etc without an adapter. Unless it's that brand new 2025 EV6; then you will probably need a CCS->NACS adapter. Yes, adapters are a way of life with DC fast charging now...

This is currently the most mature and profitable segment:

* **ABB Ltd (ABB)**: Swiss company with a global presence in automation and industrial robotics.
* **Fanuc (FANUY)**: Japanese leader in industrial robotics, especially factory automation.
* **Yaskawa Electric (YASKY)**: Another major Japanese player focused on automation and industrial robots.
* **KUKA**: German robotics company now owned by China's Midea Group, so not directly listed.
* **Rockwell Automation (ROK)**: More focused on automation but includes key robotics components for smart factories.

# 3. Other related areas

* **Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)**: Leader in medical robotics with its Da Vinci surgical system.
* **iRobot (IRBT)**: Known for Roomba. Less cutting-edge, but still robotics-related.
* **Nvidia (NVDA)**: Doesn’t build robots but provides critical AI and computer vision hardware/software (Jetson, CUDA, etc.).
* **KEYENCE (KYCCF)**: Specializes in sensors and industrial automation—key for robotic systems.

comment,1ktunpc,1ktunpc,,"You definitely shouldn't trust Tesla to be competitive by the time that could possibly become a common household item. If Musk says they are looking at $20-30k I would expect $40k. 

Amazon already has a home robot on the market for $1000 that they can use to train their programming and scale up in cost and functionality. They already have Alexa and ring in people's helping train the AI to work more effectively. 

 To me that makes them the clear front runner. Even if Tesla offers one for $20k, Amazon might be able to offer something comparable for $10,000, have more integration, and have a much better platform to get it to people at a lower cost. 

I'm also not sold on the viability of a $20,000 robot that does dishes and laundry  for 99% of Americans. Its like.

comment,1kx5c3a,1kx5c3a,,">""In China, we see intense competition and Tesla is no longer seen as the technology leader.""

I think this is the real kicker here. 

While the sales decline worldwide (especially in the US) has *some* to do with Elon's salute and his time at Doge,  I think other factors have contributed much more to it. Tesla's sales have been shrinking for the past two years.

A very limited and aging lineup, 3/5 of which are out of the reach of the average person has played a big role. More people want SUVs over sedans, so Tesla is effectively competing with just one model. I don't think the refresh was significant enough for people to want to upgrade.

I too believe that nobody thinks of them as the technology leader anymore which is why the competition has been able to gain a foothold. 

Their tech is still better than the competition in North America in the sense that everything just works and works seamlessly, lag free, but I don't think that's gonna cut it anymore.

comment,1kxxgm4,1kxxgm4,,"Let me get this straight:

* Your dad:
   * Intends to buy a used Tesla, 
   * Qualifies for the used EV tax credit,  
   * Wants to get the used EV tax credit, and
   * Does not qualify to get a loan to buy a Tesla.
* You and your brother:
   * Intend to put your names on the loan so your dad can get the loan and 
   * Do not qualify for the used EV tax credit.

Your question is, ""Will putting your name and your brother's name on the loan and (I presume) any title documents cause any problems with your dad getting the tax credit?"" 

Answer: probably not.  

As far as the IRS is concerned, it seems as though only the person the dealer reports to the IRS as the buyer needs to qualify for the used tax credit.  The IRS doesn't exactly say this, but here are the clues:

In [IRS FS-2024-26, page 4, A11](https://www.irs.gov/pub/taxpros/fs-2024-26.pdf#page=4), the IRS mentioned multiple people getting the *new* EV tax credit:

>The name and taxpayer identification number of the owner claiming the New Clean Vehicle Credit should be listed on the seller’s report. See Topic B, FAQ 9. Accordingly, multiple owners of a new clean vehicle should inform the seller which owner will claim the New Clean Vehicle Credit so that the seller can identify that taxpayer on the seller’s report. **The credit would be allowed only on the tax return of the owner listed in the seller’s report.",3559,True,1748482402.0,2025-05-29 03:33:22,3,0,SirMontego,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kxxgm4/cosign_on_used_ev_credit/mut2xr0/,True,,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,mut2xr0

comment,1kxu7oq,1kxu7oq,,"I do think we have to address the budget buyer use case too. The used market for EV is strong and getting stronger, as EV owners turn over to their 2nd (or 3rd) EV purchases. 

Used 1st(ish) generation EVs are getting quite affordable. Obviously check the model or brand specific subreddit for common issues, but a used EV is a great value, even with nominal battery degradation. 

As an example, I was shopping for a new commuter car and I wanted an EV. I wanted a small, efficient EV that didn’t look ridiculous. I also didn’t want to spend $25k - $50k for a new car that would depreciate as soon as I signed the paperwork. 

I didn’t need a lot of range, since it’s going back and forth to work and around town. Automated driving was a low priority, because I actually like to drive, though some enhanced safety features are fine. Similarly, have the ability to use DCFC in a pinch was good, but I didn’t need huge max DC speed. 

After looking at leafs, ford focus EVs, miniEVs, and others, I zeroed in on the e-Golf. The 2017-20 versions have DCFC and a “larger” battery that gets over 125mi in EPA and real-life driving in good weather. Some also have heat pumps for HVAC that help mitigate winter losses, though at the cost of a potential failure point. 

I was able to grab one used with less than 30k miles for under $20k and it’s a blast to drive.
