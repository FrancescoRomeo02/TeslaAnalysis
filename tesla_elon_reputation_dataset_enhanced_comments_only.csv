But... would insurance typically cover damage in this scenario?  If so,  whose?  


My thoughts are the unconscious guy's insurance would pick it up... As the driver ""fails to avoid"" an impact with a car ahead.


But... the Tesla guy is intentionally ""crashing"" his car.

comment,6erjqi,6erjqi,,"No, I don't. And quite frankly, I'm getting pretty tired of hearing that narrative.

First of all, let me say that I am pretty happy with my personal life. Me and my wife frequently go to the movies, hike the mountains, hang at the beach, visit museums and whatnot. I love to cook, play videogames, work out regularly, have many friends and occasionally get to drink copious amounts of beer. So although working at SpaceX can get rough from time to time, it's hardly fair to say that my life outside work sucks.

Nevertheless, working at SpaceX (and supposedly the same can be said for Tesla) can be extremely hard, challenging and stressful. Expectations are high, days are often long and I probably could get paid more elsewhere. So yeah, sure; I think it's fair to say that my job has affected my personal life quite a bit, and many of the horror stories you've heard are probably true, at least to some extent. But I truly detest the idea that Elon is some sort of slave-master, exploiting young souls under dangerous and unhealthy working conditions at sub-par wages, all so he can line his pockets with profits. That is just pure bullshit.

Naturally, working at SpaceX will not be for everyone. And I don't mean that in an arrogant way, as in ""hurrdurr some people are not smart/tough/awesome enough to work here""; I mean that different people value things differently.

>Better yet, he had to have the first one.

>""The policy was that only after the car was officially on sale and the price had been set could anybody reserve a Model S,"" Jurvetson said last month, recalling that board meeting in early 2009. ""They were about to open the meeting, so without saying a word I whip out my wallet, where I always keep one check, fill it out for the full price of the car, and then toss it across the table. Everyone was stunned.""

those turns at high speed take a ton of downforce to keep traction.  tough to judge aerodynamics but optimizing the tesla for low drag s different than downforce.  

cooling for a 7 minute run at full power would be insane.  the lambo's engine oil/coolant is at something like 275F, compared to the tesla's battery and motors needing to stay at like 125F.  Heat is dissipated proportional to the difference to ambient air, so that means tesla would need like 4x the radiator size to dissipate the same power as the lambo.

comment,7e2ze2,7e2ze2,,"Bugatti hasn’t even attempted top speed in their car yet. The 261 is just what they limit the car to right now for their customers.

Everyone knows it will be 280mph+, the question is can they find new tires that let them reach 300.

If you read Motor Trend’s review of the Chiron, they said a $180k Turbo S would accelerate as fast in 0-60, but the Chiron feels to accelerate faster from 60-180mph than it does 0-60, that’s where most of the power delivery is.

It’s odd that Tesla only bragged about 0-60 and 0-100mph numbers, for most hyper cars that aim for 250mph+ top speed, they brag about 0-124, 60-150, or 0-200mph time, that’s where the differences lie. 

Actually they mostly brag about lap times around the Nurburgring, since that’s a better indicator of the overall performance of a vehicle.  

One big concern with EV in this context is that due to the nature of EV, a powerful car would require a big battery pack, and current battery technology means it will be a very heavy battery pack. Weight is public enemy number one as far as motor sport engineering is concerned, so the Roadster's track performance is still a big question mark at this point. I personally think if they solve the battery cooling issue, it should be very respectable, but very, very unlikely to be record setting considering some of the [bat shit insane stuff](https://jalopnik.com/the-1000-horsepower-mercedes-amg-project-one-this-is-1803141648) that's coming out right around the same time.",1975,True,1511124011.0,2017-11-19 21:40:11,2666,0,cookingboy,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7e2ze2/tesla_vs_bugatti/dq24dq8/,True,,2017,tesla,top,False,False,0,dq24dq8

comment,7ktg18,7ktg18,,"It has the *potential* to put Tesla in a good situation. 

Tesla still need to deliver on their promises but until then, this is still in the *potential* category of game-changers. 

I don’t wanna sound like a nay-sayer because I’m far from that, but i also don’t want to fall in the trap of being a blind fan. 

Edit: 

There's been a few replies to this comment and another comment about my ""cautiously optimistic"" statement. I'll try to reply to those comments as well but I wanted to add an edit here to get ahead of the ""you're wrong"" replies. 

My comment here is not meant to say that Tesla will not fulfill their promise, nor am I trying to argue that Tesla is not currently in a good situation. I'm just addressing the comment that the Semi will put Tesla in a good situation. I believe the Semi **can** put Tesla in a good situation but as of right now, it can't do much other than fuel the hype. There are no Tesla's on the road transporting goods, or even Tesla semis in production, it's simply a POC right now and trying to shake up the industry. 

So again, I'll reiterate what my comment was originally trying to say. The Semi *can* be a big deal, the Semi *can* become a game-changer, the Semi *can* put Tesla in a good situation, but as of December 19 2017, the Tesla Semi is simply just another proof of concept similar to the [Nikola Corp](https://nikolamotor.com/one) electric semi.",1402,False,1513693981.0,2017-12-19 15:33:01,606,0,Ragnar_Targaryen,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7ktg18/ups_preorders_125_tesla_electric_trucks/drh09ma/,True,,2017,tesla,top,False,False,0,drh09ma

comment,81xi87,81xi87,,"Your comment had me wondering, how expensive is it really? Obviously the Tesla's are luxury priced, but then again isn't Europe the place where people get taxi'ed in Mercedes? Can the alledged lower running costs of a Tesla Model S make up the cost difference? I dug around and found this

According to [this source](https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/Netherlands/diesel_prices/), the average diesel price in the Netherlands for the past few months has been 1,27 euros per liter, that's $5.9/gallon. Gasoline is even worse, 1.55 euros per liter or $7.22/gallon, but for the sake of the argument let's go with diesel.

According to [this source](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/8/8c/Electricity_prices%2C_first_half_of_year%2C_2015-2017.png), the average **household** price of a kWh of energy in the Netherlands in the 1st semester of last year was 0.156 euros per kWh, non-household is considerably lower, but let's go with worst case scenario.

The first Model S seen in the picture has a 85 kWh battery, according [to this source](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=32557) to be good enough for 265 miles, or 426 km. But let's go with 400 km to round it down, that's 4.7 km per kWh

Now let's find a comparable car to match the Tesla against.

It's not that the car has extra battery cells, is that they limit the charge capacity of each cell to improve durability.

Tesla board member, Steve Jurvetson called it ""the most extraordinary act of entrepreneurial zeal and commitment I've ever seen.""

&#x200B;

The financing round was falling apart because the entire global economy appeared to be on brink of collapse, and investors were extremely skittish about investing in a car startup that was on the verge of bankruptcy. At the last hour, Elon essentially said, ""screw it, I'll personally finance the entire round."" Elon was willing to go net negative on his net worth to save Tesla. This changed the mood in the room and the round closed.

I often wonder if the Model S is the single most common specific car in Santa Clara County.  There are definitely way more non-Teslas than Teslas around here still, but for a specific model, I bet the S would rank pretty high.  The other day I counted 11 Teslas (about 8 were model S) in a row in the carpool lane going South on 85 at the end of a work day.  That's my highest count so far.  I forget the exact number but if I allowed one or two non-Teslas in the count it would have been even higher.

Many of our members including me e-mailed Tesla about this and all we got was 'You are an unsupported market so we won't even update your timezone.' I've been replying to every Elon tweet trying to get this heard. Tesla's official account contacted me once via DM and asked for my VIN.

I think it's too bad that you are not getting the support you want. However, I think the answer to why this is happening is hidden in this reply right here. It may well be that Tesla (or their advisers) have come to the conclusion that if they start creating solutions for the Turkish market, the will have ""entered that market"", and therefore be obliged to provide additional support to Turkish Tesla owners, follow specific Turkish regulations etc. 

In other words, fixing a small issue in relation to Turkey might bring other consequences with it for the company. Not saying I agree with that stance, and of course I think it'd be really good if Tesla entered all markets to help move everyone to a sustainable mode of transport, but it may be the explanation.

For absolutely sure. For the record, steering out of the way like that should not be a human's gut reaction because if you steer into oncoming traffic (particularly a highway) it could lead to a significantly worse crash, and on top of that you would be 100% liable for any crash/damage that occurred as a result of that maneuver. If the autopilot was able to reliably determine there was no oncoming car and steer out of the way to avoid the front end collision, that is a really good outcome! I'm not sure if it is state specific, but OP could've been liable/partially liable for hitting the car in front (typical reasoning is that ""you were following too closely"").",717,False,1557111882.0,2019-05-06 05:04:42,881,0,wighty,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/bl5pa9/tesla_model_3_saved_me/emm2utd/,True,,2019,tesla,top,False,False,0,emm2utd

comment,c4wu67,c4wu67,,"So I never saw the car until he speed past me.  He tried to use the merge lane to pass on the right.  After the accident I didn't go near his car and stayed with the guy who took the initial hit (he was shaken up).  

When the cops arrived I just told the cop(s) that I had a video when he needed it and was let go (the cops didn't want us to stay for fear of another accident).  When the police called me I had this clip ready (I only noticed the White Model 3 getting hit when I pulled the video).  Cop told me the Durango driver claimed he was swerving to avoid a speeding car behind him when the accident occurred and none of the other drivers knew what happened. Luckily I was able to prove he was a liar and I am a formal witness to the accident with my footage attached to the report.  

The Cop did ask how I was able to provide all the footage so I told him its standard on Teslas.

Update/additional information since I am seeing the same questions.

Apparently he hired an EU Rocket Scientist named Jim Cantrell to teach him rocketry. Cantrell said Elon was the smartest scientist he had ever met and could repeat sections of the book verbatim. Which says a lot coming from a guy that spends his life surrounded by scientists. 

>(Interviewer) You have worked with Tesla and SpaceX founder, Elon Musk, in the past. I think it’s difficult for the public to perceive a figure like Elon Musk. Hype or Genius?

>(Cantrell) Elon is the real deal. Transformational people come from ordinary walks of life. He is certainly a transformational person. He represents that nomadic part of our species that is enormously powerful. He’s unlike anyone I’ve ever known. He’s by far the smartest guy I’ve ever known. He’s also the most motivated and ambitious person I’ve ever met. His desire, as he puts it, to make humanity a multi-planetary species is deeply ingrained, and he will either do it or die trying.

comment,d25ver,d25ver,,"Person with a Disability here (powerchair user)-

The trick with making a wheelchair accessible Tesla would been 2 main engineering challenges to overcome: first being head room, most vehicles conversations accomplish this either raising the roof or dropping the floor. Dropping the floor tends to be the preferred method since the other tends to look like shit, doesn't make the vehicle more likely to flip, and makes the other engineering challenge easier. The second challenge is getting the chair in. Most lowered floor vehicles use a bi fold ramp or an in floor ramp that slides out automatically (mine has this). The downside of this is the floor is slightly higher, not much though. The lowered floor makes the slope easier and also have a ""kneel"" option to make it even easier (mine does this but it's off since I don't need it, because powerchair, and it's one less thing to break). Raised roof vehicles have to a lift in some form which is it's own complexity. 

The other issues are easy to figure out. You'd need a door, [Braun's Ford Explorer conversation does this well](https://www.themobilityresource.com/uploaded/blog/images/Braunability-MXV-secondary.jpg). You'd also need a floor system with a track to lock in accessories (chair straps, EZ Locks, seat belt holders, passenger seats).  That's easy. You'll also want to make the controls each to adapt for those with hand control setups. 

If Telsa can lower the floor in a Model X, then I think it'd work.",1976,True,1568148404.0,2019-09-10 22:46:44,23,0,Fp_Guy,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/d25ver/tesla_summon_is_a_gimmickk_thx_bi/ezuah4j/,True,,2019,tesla,top,False,False,0,ezuah4j

comment,e1os5v,e1os5v,,"Sad to see this sub ragging on Neil here...

The fact is that Neil has a point, the Ford is a RWD that is a lot heavier over the front axel. The Cybertruck is an AWD that has even distribution of weight. Cybertruck would not have won in such a large margin if the bed of the F-150 was loaded with stuff, therefore giving more traction to the rear wheels.

In a more recent tweet he acknowledges the fact that, fully laden, Cyber truck wins out due to torque.

People here are pretending that Neil knows nothing about basic physics. He has a doctorate degree in astrophysics for crying out loud. Sometimes he says some cringe things, sure, but that doesn't give the right to disregard someones viewpoint who is likely a lot smarter than the average human.

They had a slight twitter kerfuffle, that's it.

Originally the module would only output the data as a sort of table view. I wanted a fancier, more app-like display - so this being open source, I just sit down and built the view as I wanted it :) It takes the car image directly from Tesla's own image compositor service that's also used on their website and in the app, so it can show all Tesla models in any color/wheels/options combo that's available.

Yeah, so it's ***production*** that matters, not deliveries/sales.

Here's the historic Tesla production numbers table [I posted over at /r/teslainvestorsclub as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/fg6uwh/elon_congratulations_tesla_team_on_making_our/fk3fey2/):

    year | Tesla vehicle production
       -- | --
    -2011 | ~2,500 (early Roadster)
     2012 |   3,100
     2013 |  23,187
     2014 |  35,000
     2015 |  51,095
     2016 |  83,922
     2017 | 101,027
     2018 | 254,530
     2019 | 365,232
   **total**  | **919,593** vehicles
     March 9 | 1,000,000-919,593 = 80,407
     **Q1'2020 full** | **110,400** (est.)


There's another 3 weeks left in March, and with Fremont production at 7k/week and GF3 production at 3k/week there will probably/possibly be another ~30k vehicles made in this quarter - this is the basis of the 110,400 estimate in the final line.",2201,True,1583831320.0,2020-03-10 10:08:40,129,0,__Tesla__,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/fg6smp/elon_congratulations_tesla_team_on_making_our/fk3fqt5/,True,,2020,both,top,False,False,0,fk3fqt5

comment,ipp3e9,ipp3e9,,"I think your framework is correct, but your analysis is wrong. Here are some inconsistencies I noticed in your theory:

When you say:

>**Catalysts**: These are are things required to trigger a bubble collapse. Almost every bubble has had some notable catalyst(s) to trigger the rapid decline. As mentioned in Profit Taking, **we've had three catalysts occur so far that triggered panic selling. New Tesla shares, secondary Tesla offloading, and Softbank.** They are the big one and who I will focus on for a minute.

Why do you think Tesla stock split + dilution is a catalyst for the market crash? I don't think that makes sense. As for Softbank, they bought calls in mainly the FAANG stocks, they didn't buy Calls on the whole market. Could Tech stocks crashing back to say, April levels, bring us back to SPY under 300? Sure. But re-test and breach the March lows? No way, not with the amount of liquidity sloshing around out there with 0% Interest Rates.

&#x200B;

>Market cap to GDP was 2:1 at peak. The dotcom crash was 1.4 and the recession was 1.1. Currently 1.77:1.

The Wilshire Index (AKA the ""Buffet Indicator"") is outdated and no longer relevant in my opinion. It's supposed to be a measure of US domiciled publicly traded companies Market Cap vs the GDP of the US. What it doesn't take into account however, is that most US business do business overseas, and not just in the US.

It's very interesting that the bull and bear traps look exactly the same and they exist very close to each other on the spectrums (the bear trap basically leads right into the bull trap, post blow-off.). That's totally where my issue lies in my own argument. I wasn't sure if this was another violent shake-off leading into the last phase or if it was the crash itself. I'm still not entirely convinced it's not the crash though. Like you said, there needs to be confirmation one way or another.

It really doesn't take much to start a bubble crashing. One thing can cause others to compound on each other. Catalysts don't all have to be covid level to trigger a collapse. Looking into the dotcom bust, the catalyst was money managers urging their clients to rebalance their portfolios. That looks awfully similar to Tesla's second largest stockholder doing the same. Nothing is ever the same twice, and it's totally ridiculous to count Tesla as the main driver of this, but at the same time, they represent the emotional sentiment of this market as a whole.

comment,kpeffw,kpeffw,,"Perhaps we are indeed due for a dramatic correction. I think the difference for this ""bubble"" is in the quality/quantity of the underlying companies behind the securities.

In the dotcom bubble, there was a plethora of companies for every problem -- and they all promised to be the end-all, be-all.

Today, there are only a few companies for every problem -- and the reason the companies are worth so much is because there is no doubt that they deserve the faith bestowed upon then.

If I believe in online retail as an industry worth investing in, wouldn't a wise investment be Amazon? Would you say I'm being unwise to put money in Facebook if I want to invest in social media and marketing? Sure, there are other players that cover bases that the biggest companies don't do well enough -- but they are niche cases.

Even Tesla, which is arguably overvalued, is a company with great promise. If I had to put my eggs in the basket of a company that I believe will solve our transportation needs for the foreseeable future, it's them. Really, the main thing that's going to cause their valuation to pop is if they prove themselves to be unworthy of our faith.

Perhaps a good analogy would be: *In the 90s, we had a million Nikolas. Today, it’s a million Tesla shareholders.*

The investment thesis is that Tesla will be on the forefront of the EVs that we are driving. They will hold patents and intellectual property that will influence the entire auto industry in terms of decades.

Their battery technology will reinvent the way we think about every electronic device. Their solar innovations, everything we thought about power generation.

Think about it: Plenty of companies are trying to make a good EV. Plenty are trying to develop autonomous vehicles. Tesla isn’t trying to get us all in an EV in 5 years — they *fully anticipate* that our cars will drop us off for work, and then go transport other people before picking us up at the end of the day.

I really think that Musk is the Steve Jobs of transportation. If there’s a better way to do things entirely, he can see it, and he heads straight for it. He doesn’t chip away at incremental improvements to an unsatisfactory model; he makes the incremental improvements necessary to achieve the ideal solution.

Now, Tesla has plenty of wood to chop to get there. But is an investor’s faith misguided? Is there another company that is a wiser choice?

* How is this muscle created? Precision fermentation? Nanotech? Cell cultures?

Optimistically, at least a few decades and billions in research. Elon's $100m prize money will barely make a dent on this front alone.
* Biological muscles aren't simple structures, nor are they capable of ""repairing themselves"" on their own. Hell, they don't even feed themselves. They require other mechanical systems in place to transport material & energy and discard waste, such as mechanical pumps for circulatory and respiratory regulation.
* Do the math on the amount of force your own muscles are capable of (estimate the muscle mass, in kg), then extrapolate that to try to solve for the amount of muscle needed to push a 2-ton vehicle to 60mph. Note: this relationship is not linear.

comment,l7fw2f,l7fw2f,,"First of all, I'll note that I'm not an expert in this, but here's my understanding. I'm sure someone will correct me quickly enough if I'm wrong (the fastest way to find something out on the internet: say it wrong, and someone will rapidly scream at you how much of an idiot you are)

Unfortunately there's no nice easy ""story time"" analogy like short selling to help explain it super simply. But Puts and Calls are fairly easy concepts anyway, with ways to over-complicate them. The simple version, in both cases, is you're paying a premium/fee now, in order to be able to buy (call) or sell (put) at a fixed price in future.

You pay the fee either way, and it's non-refundable. In return, you are given an ""option"" (choice) of whether you want to execute your put/call in future. That's where the name ""Option"" comes from - you're buying an option to buy/sell at a fixed price in future.

For example I might think TSLA is going to rise in price in the next year, but I want to limit my losses to 20% of my current holding in case I'm wrong. I can buy a Put Option on TSLA at, say, 90% of the current price, and pay a fee of about 10% of the current price. Then in a year, I have an option to sell my TSLA shares at 90% of the current price. I'm down my fee and the 10% loss, but if the price has dropped to 50% in a year, I've massively reduced my risk. The downside being that if the price goes up 20% in a year, I'm only actually up 10% because I've paid a fee for my Option.",2531,True,1611893728.0,2021-01-29 05:15:28,142,0,audigex,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/l7fw2f/elon_burn_ouch/gl6ydp8/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,gl6ydp8

comment,l7qlfh,l7qlfh,,"Yeah... So I've found a pretty massive wrench in everyone's thesis.

The short interest results that were posted 1/27 were actually settled 1/15. There has been enough volatility in the past 2 weeks for shorts to easily close out without anyone noticing. If that's true, it would make sense for them (or anyone) to short again while above 300, especially if they knew the original 61 million shorts were already cleared.

People also keep saying ""Days to Cover is still 2.5!"" Yeah, that doesn't mean anything in a volatile market like this. Days to Cover, aka Short Interest, is a function of (Shares Shorted) / (Avg Volume). Avg volume is over the past 30 days. The first 15 of the past 30 days saw much lower volume. Current Short Ratio is closer to 0.5-1. If they could cover their entire positions in 1 day (causing a spike obviously), who's to say they didn't clear over a 10 day period (causing the spikes we saw), then, knowing they lost $4 billion (if cleared around the $62 price range, which I suspect), why not take out new short positions around $300? The price can't go up any more if there's no short squeeze coming.

Just my 2 cents. I get downvoted for this on WSB, so it's apparent no one wants to objectively discuss this very real possibility.

Gamestop on the other hand, anyone with half a brain and an internet account knows doesn't have much of a business model anymore (certainly not something to justify current valuation levels) so sooner or later people (even the amateurs) are going to realize that its in a price bubble unrelated to its fundamentals.

comment,lg54b5,lg54b5,,"I'm far more of an Elon skeptic than an Elon fan, but as someone who got in early on the Starlink Beta, I've been impressed. 

I think there *are* advantages to having someone like Elon at the helm, who just ""gets things done."" 

I was thinking about this in relation to the [beta invite](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/27/spacex-starlink-service-priced-at-99-a-month-public-beta-test-begins.html) I got.   Any other company would have had it go through a marketing department, get corporate colors applied, and be A/B tested through like 12 rounds of revisions. 

It was obvious that someone at SpaceX was just like, ""This is funny send it out!""  

And you know what?  It worked well.  All those designs and revisions and everything else would have slowed down the process, and cost money and not actually added any value. 

If you think about those types of operations happening thousands of ways throughout an Elon company, you begin to see why they can get things to market faster than their competitors, and be more efficient. 

The actual beta experience has been really good.  Took us from ~8mbps to 150mbps.  Early on it had pretty regular downtime (about a few minutes every hour), but it's been improving regularly.  

It'll be interesting to see if speeds/performance suffer as more users are added, but if they can keep delivering the experience we've had, I have no doubt it'll be a long term success, at least from a demand standpoint.",1723,True,1612891039.0,2021-02-09 18:17:19,213,0,AtOurGates,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lg54b5/spacex_begins_accepting_99_preorders_for_its/gmptuxq/,True,,2021,elon,top,False,False,0,gmptuxq

Model 3 is no slouch when it comes to handling but it's not close to that level.

Plus the Taycan it's a lot faster and has a way more comparable range to the Model 3 than it looks on paper.

All of this is to say that, even the fact that you could compare the two is crazy, I'll agree with you.

The real comparisons that are ridiculously skewed to Model 3's favor are the ones that compare it to other luxury performance sedans at the same point, though. Like the Model 3 Performance is so much above those in terms of speed, practicality, and features, that one wonders why the hell would anybody buy anything else.

comment,lqfhuz,lqfhuz,,"Bonds are always being sold just like stocks are. Stocks have the stock market, bonds have the bond market.

Yields are going up because inflation is going up. If you are buying debt, and inflation is rising faster than the interest rate, then you're essentially _paying_ the borrower for access to your money. So bond buyers are demanding higher interest rates right now, causing yields to increase as well.

Then your super safe index investor begins to look at historically high bond yields compared to SPY and it's risks, and decides to invest in bond indexes. This outflow causes SPY and it's components to go lower. Someone that was invested in TSLA will look at how low SPY is and it's relative security, and invest into that. This will lower the price of TSLA, making it attractive to the CCIV holder, etc. 

The whole thing is a feedback loop because this shift into bonds really does make stocks go down, _and_ at the same time feel more risky, causing people to but ""safe"" bonds.

I don't think bitcoin works as a hedge against market fluctuations. It appears that, when the stock market crashes, bitcoin crashes even more.  Compare the graphs of March 2020 between bitcoin, and a stock market index to see for yourself. 

Further, due to the massive amount of electricity bitcoin wastes (A lot of it is from coal power.) bitcoin doesn't belong in a world worried about global warming.

[Latest Update!](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/m8ac8v/130am_update_still_trapped_at_a_supercharger/grji3sv)

EDIT:

FINAL UPDATE - Apologies for taking so long to give an update here, I just wanted to wait to confirm whether this was an ongoing issue or not. Once Tesla got engaged, they were great about getting the car in quickly and doing all the diagnostic work they could think of. They had even seen my Reddit posts, so they were up to date on the situation without having to explain anything.

The weren’t able to replicate the issue, but wound up replacing the charge port anyway to be safe. The data from the car suggested a voltage spike during charging which caused the charge port to enter a fault  state and shut off. It’s unclear why the cord would not disengage, but I’m assuming it was able to do so once that fault cleared itself overnight. This makes some sense as it was pouring rain a few minutes prior to us charging, which I was told is the main culprit for this voltage spike fault.

Since then, we’ve had no issues with charging (knock on wood).",1585,True,1616133469.0,2021-03-19 06:57:49,1707,0,SeaEnergy,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/m8ac8v/130am_update_still_trapped_at_a_supercharger/grgbbix/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,grgbbix

This is something I’ve seen happen before with even the mobile charger and wall connector as the latch can get stuck in the channel just like pins in a lock when attempting a lock pick (for lack of a better example). And again I am basing this purely off the video as it seems there is only outward force being applied to it so maybe you already do this and have done this for this case, BUT, I would suggest always lightly “jerking” the plug both in and out after and even a little before pressing the button. You can feel and hear the plug give a little as it slides in and out ever so slightly and hits the limits of the lock and the channel (which is another reason I am suggesting this is because I did not hear that in the video). This basically ensures that the channel is lined up and not pressed on the locking pin which is holding it in either by the angle it is pushing the locking pin or friction between the mechanism and the cable insert itself.

I got a call this morning around 11:30am from someone at Tesla Service. She had already seen this Reddit post, had read all of the updates, and had someone on their way to inspect the charging station.

I then dropped off the car this afternoon at the service center. Everyone there had seen this post as well and knew what was going on as soon as I arrived. They said they’re going to take a few days to run some tests, look at the error logs, and try to recreate the issue. Probably won’t have an update on that until early next week.

I should mention that I’m not upset with any individual for what happened. Every single Tesla employee I’ve spoken to has been professional and (I think) did everything they can to help resolve this. The larger concern I have is around the organization and staffing decisions.

Look at the R&D spent. 100% up from last year. They *doubled* their R&D spend and still were able to beat earnings. That's the story apparently no one cares about. The Bitcoin sale is pure noise IMO. The vast majority of money made was spent to expand the company's production capacity.

[Capital investment to build a new Tesla factory is roughly $1B now. The total 12-month revenue that comes from a full production factory is $2.5B (250K cars/year).

I don't know what's more crazy. The fact that even on an unprepped surface this full size family sedan can go 0-60 faster than literally every automobile on the planet that isn't some multimillion dollar hypercar.

(like when Elon Musk decides to tweet something)
The only reason I see to buy USDT with usd is if you want to use an exchange that doesn't deal in fiat.

Say I bought 10$ worth of crypto and after the pump it is now worth 100$, before the dump I convert it to USDT (because I don't want to cash out , since I'm waiting for the next pump) , the concern here is whether the extra 90$ that came out of thin air is really backed by usd. That is , whether a company with ~25 employees producing no other product or service (other than USDT itself) has the capability to back ~60 billion usd worth of USDT with actual usd.



>They have done so with $1 USD or equivalent value of another currency

You should always run the numbers yourself and with your financial planner to see it fit your needs and situation based on age, income, state, other factors, different investment objectives. 

Hell Yeah, put in $100/mo in a safer, simple, and stable S&P500(VOO) first . Keep it for life especially in a maxed out Roth IRA and, HSA. 

 Put an extra $100/mo in a 3X S&P500(UPRO) .  Wait up to 5 years to sell $2k-5k gains tax free( long term capital).  This protects your gains without a 15%-25% tax penalty.  Use the realized gain to buy more S&P500 (VOO) and keep it for a life. 

Investing 2.0 is used if you have extra income, want to support faster VOO growth, and can tax loss harvest. 

VOO 10% annualized returns is only meant as a hedge against 5% future inflation and small retirement. 


The underlining S&P500 index would need to lose 34% in one day to be instantly wiped out in UPRO. Highly unlikely with exchange safe guards and risk management.  UPRO is meant as a short term investing. 

No one is saying puting all money or sufficient amount in UPRO.  $100 or 10% is adequate risk and benefit for UPRO.  

Example #1. Investing 1.0. Put $100/mo in VOO for 30 years returns an  est. $228k.  After  inflation, adjusted purchasing power is $113k in 2051.

Elon holds a scholarly competition for hyperloop. The Boring tunnels are not hyperloop... ffs. They aren't even operating yet, technically. The tunnels are there though. Might as well let them get some use as they continue to build out infrastructure and develop the autonomous system. Until that's finished it's just a small tunnel. Nothing special except for the machine that made it. 
Tunnels are definitely useful. We have them in plenty of places and they also can get traffic and have issues but are of net gain. The advantage of Boring Co. being that electric vehicles require less ventilation in the tunnels and autonomous vehicles require less space.
So the tunnels become cheaper than a single lane addition to any city street, which is impossible in most places, no room. Plenty of room underground. If you can get the cost of the tunnels low enough, you can keep adding lanes, near indefinitely, as far as population density is concerned.

Autonomous vehicles will be here sooner than later and it will take 15-20 years going gangbusters to get enough of these tunnels put in. Stop trying to slow them down. We need these. BEFORE autonomous vehicles are available.

I mean, not really. Delaware Chancery Court is going to force him to go through with the sale at the $54.20 price specifically for all of the reasons you just said. Elon has *every financial incentive* not to do what he's doing, but he's got an addictive personality and, right now, he's addicted to shitposting.

He's going to instantly lose billions of dollars by spending $44B on a company that's worth, at most, about $20–30B. Not only that, but as his debt financing expires, he may be compelled to sell huge quantities of TSLA shares at a significant discount just to complete the purchase. 

On top of the billions he's going to lose in the sale, the SEC is also likely to fine him a giant amount of money or ban him from serving as an officer of any publicly traded company.

Elon's sitting comfortably in the ""fuck around"" phase right now, but the ""find out"" phase is coming. He can save face by following through on the $54.20 deal without forcing it through court.

comment,v1itrt,v1itrt,,"I’m the opposite of a Tesla fanboy, but what large NYSE listed car manufacturers aren’t down significantly? Ford is down 50%, GM 40%, and even Toyota and Ferrari have been down close to 30%.

Tesla gets the headlines because of its overall valuation, but on percentage terms, it’s only down marginally higher than other large car stocks.

Having said that, investors priced Tesla at its peak like it’s the Apple of car stocks. The car industry is vastly different, and I’m of the opinion that the new Toyota EV (the Toyota BZ4X) is going to fly off the shelves. Not because it’s the best EV or has the best performance figures, but because Toyota has some of the most loyal customers in the world. It’s perceived as the most reliable and trustworthy brand, and it’s why the Corolla and RAV4 are the two highest selling cars by volume in the world. The Corolla isn’t the best car in its class, but everyone that buys it knows what they’re getting (reliability, ease of use, build quality, resale value, good capped priced servicing etc).

Tesla don’t even make the best EV in the world. The best EV according to various 2021 car of the year awards is the Kia EV6. 

The interesting aspect to Tesla that I’m waiting to see play out is the polarising views of Musk himself.

I added 5% more at the restaurant and arrived in Gallup with 10% just about where ABRP predicted and 20% less than the NAV predicted.

Generally, I would not let the personal behavior of a company's CEO dictate a buying decision.

Only real difference is that the outer ""rain slick"", or whatever you want to call it, appears to be darker in the customer images, and ""looser"", but that might be attributed to the fact that they put it together in the rain and don't have it all secured and such.

I feel like people are judging based off of the *concept* drawing, and not what's actually being sold through the website...

The Caliber study relates specifically to corporate reputation, where Tesla dropped by almost 30 pts in its “Trust & Like” and “Consideration” indexes over the last two years, which measure peoples’ opinion of a brand and if they’d consider buying their product.

They don’t appear to draw a direct line to Musk’s behavior, unclear if there’s a question in their survey directly about that, but it would be a pretty strange thing to have asked *before* Musk started having a higher profile and revealed his controversial political alignment. I also seriously doubt they’d have questions about any other auto executives — could you even name the president of Honda America?

Instead Caliber threads the needle by pointing out their survey does show that 83% of adults know who Musk is and that he runs Tesla.

Not an entirely unreasonable conclusion to jump to, but I’d still rate this a bad use of data.

Personally I would not consider a Tesla because I think they’re generally very good computers wrapped in a very mediocre car.

It shocks me how negative the tone is here about FSD. I live in Los Angeles where city driving can be hectic and the latest FSD v12 is a game changer.

It makes the right decisions (and drives better than I do) 99% of the time. The 1% of the time it makes the wrong decisions are usually very obvious beforehand and it's easy for me to disengage, quickly make the right decision, and fire FSD right back up.

I use it almost exclusively for every drive now and will never drive another car that doesn't offer it. Even despite monitoring the road the entire time, I am no longer making thousands of brain-fatiguing micro decisions every time I'm in the driver's seat and driving is such a pleasure.

comment,1ctjrpu,1ctjrpu,,"A few thoughts from an actual user:

  
It had a few hiccups, but it was a LOT better than I thought it would be. The few times I had to intervene were mostly because I wasn't comfortable with the situation. For example, I didn't like that it didn't seem to pay attention to semi's blind spots, and would just cruise right beside them. My longest trips was 140 miles on a not-so-busy highway and it was nearly perfect. I didn't intervene one time.

For the amount of miles my wife drives, $99 is too much for me. However, if I was going on a long road trip and planned on using a lot in a month, I would pay $99. I think for our amount of usage, $30 would be about right.

  
Everyone I know that tried it a lot, was really impressed. There were a few things that people complained about like accelerating fast at lights, which is more of a preference thing, which I actually enjoyed.

It made me hate AutoPilot even more. There is zero reason that I shouldn't be able to switch lanes without interrupting the cruise control.

I used FSD and the trial reaffirmed that I will never pay for FSD unless it's $2,000 or less. To me FSD still drives too slow and skittish especially at irregular stop signs or intersections. Also city / back roads the constant changing of speed limits puts you back to the speed limit, if I'm not doing 10mph over on the city streets I'll have traffic piling up my ass behind me. Also when the speed limit goes from 35 to 45mph, most human drivers are doing 50-55mph by the time you hit the 45mph sign, so people would ride up my ass and I'd manually have to speed up early.

comment,1f7a9i7,1f7a9i7,,"My wife and I were looking for a used car for our kids. Tesla wasn't on the list, but as we looked at the price of some relatively new, but un-excitinge ICE cars, we started looking at used Teslas as an option. I have a Rivian R1T (was one of the first in my area, about 1.5 years ago) and love it, but my wife was skeptical of EVs.  Eventually we found a great deal on a 2017 90D S with 40k miles, that was priced well below anything we thought was realistic. We decided (on a whim) to check it out. My wife absolutely fell in love with the car (It was in almost perfect condition, minus some paint chips on the front hood). We bought it, and after we drove away, I realized that the original owner had upgraded the computers and it had FSD. As an software engineer (and someone who has a Rivian), I was always skeptical of FSD...But I find it absolutely mind blowing....We have to tell our kids that it doesn't have it and if they try to enable it, it enables  a subscription and we will be charged (so they don't try)...

This weekend, I had a passenger taking a short 10 minute ride. He had a million of the usual questions. We arrive at his home and I see the driveway lined up with a Lamborghini, a Maybach, a pair of BMWs, and a few classic cars. He let me look at the Lamborghini up close, super cool. 

We talk for a few minutes as I wait for my next ride request. His wife comes walking out and the guy excitedly recounts his FSD experience. He offered me $100 cash if I could take them for a spin around the corner quick so the wife could experience it. 

It’s crazy to me that people like this who could buy a Model Y with a week’s worth of their salary yet had no clue what the vehicles are capable of.

comment,1g7hhm8,1g7hhm8,,"I think it’s really easy for nuance and details to get lost over text, which is part of why I don’t like everything being handled through the app. There’s a convenience factor for sure, but being there in person with a service advisor (ideally the same one each time) who can physically see the issue and keep track of things is a much better approach for situations like OP’s. 

Tesla’s advisors, from what I can tell, work from a queue and it’s often not the same person you’re interacting with from message to message or day to day (mainly in the app). I also imagine they have time-to-response metrics they’re held to in some way, so it’s super easy for context to get lost when you’re unfamiliar with the situation and jump into the message thread without reading all of the past service history and notes. 

It’s pretty inexcusable for a company of Tesla’s size to handle things this way, especially when dealing with more complex situations. It’s one thing to handle a simple tire rotation like this, but when dealing with a (fairly) complex warranty issue, there are just too opportunities for details to get lost over text. 

I’d agree that showing up in person is the way to go. I’ve always had good experiences with Tesla’s service advisors in person; so if OP has one near by, showing up in person and calmly explaining the situation would be the best place to start. 

I’d avoid mentioning a lawyer to anyone.

The H-1B visa gives an employer complete control over the employee. If the employee loses the job, they lose their visa and are sent back to their home country. This is why the plutocrats want the H-1B visas. In the program employees can be coerced into working 100-hour weeks for below average pay.

Tellingly, Elon Musk runs Tesla as a nonunion shop in the United States. Musk also has ongoing well-publicized disputes with the unions in Germany and Sweden. Musk's just a less interesting version of the 19th century robber barons who hired Pinkertons to fire upon the rank-and-file.

comment,1hq6gib,1hq6gib,,"There's a few factors at play here.

1) the median age of vehicles on the road in the US is over 12 years. Half of then are therefore pretty close to several decades old and in various states of repair.

2) accident rate increases with the age of the vehicle. Older vehicles are therefore over-represented in calls for service by first responders.

3) Older vehicles on average are less safe before you even factor in any age related degradation.


The result is something of a bias that doesn't necessarily reflect the reality of cars built in the last few years. The Model Y has a very strong roof structure. Ioniq 5's roof strength tested within 5% of the Y. Both are demonstrably very safe vehicles.

There is an impact of vehicle geometry to consider though as well. Ioniq 5 has a much closer to vertical rear gate/window which may have resulted in more of a rear collision rather than one that skidded up the Y and landed on the roof. That could be no big deal or it could be worse. There's not really a way for us to know. Oddly enough IIHS does not do any rear impact testing.

Tldr; Modern cars, especially EVs, are all quite safe. Different cars behave differently though so there's no way to really know which is better for a specific accident.",1255,False,1735653908.0,2024-12-31 15:05:08,13,0,zackplanet42,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1hq6gib/the_glass_roof_is_no_joke_a_truck_rear_ended_a/m4oy7xs/,True,,2024,tesla,top,False,False,0,m4oy7xs

What do you think it takes to get a fab running? A couple years, concrete, some low skill workers, and the requisite machines manufactured by ASML in the Netherlands? You would be thoroughly wrong if you said yes to that second question. First, just designing the building needs to take into account the need for near perfect operating conditions for the clean rooms and the other various environments necessary to produce chips from silicon wafers. If expedited, this could destroy entire batches of chips due to mild changes in weather or seismic activity, if not bring down the entire facility for an extended period of time. So that work needs to be perfect. You will note a running theme here that every single aspect of these facilities need to be effectively perfect for them to work. They are producing incredibly complex structures on the order of NANOMETERS. That requires unfathomable precision, which in turn requires eternally, completely stable operating conditions. Taking into account American sign-off processes from a bureaucratic standpoint, and the fact that American construction routinely cuts corners, TSMC would need to constantly oversee their entire building process and additionally lube the gears of the federal and local government to make this process work.",4501,True,1738073186.0,2025-01-28 15:06:26,28,0,homelessness_is_evil,investing,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ic0kp2/trump_announces_chip_tariffs_up_to_100/m9my7gb/,True,,2025,tesla,top,False,False,0,m9my7gb

Smart fundamental analysts know this. Even Bill Gates a man who basically invented the modern software empire, thought he could out logic the hype train bubble. He shorted Tesla… and boom he lost $1.5 billion. The market didn’t care about fundamentals. It cared about the story and the story is the Elon hype.

And who’s the greatest storyteller of our time? Elon Musk. The man could stand on stage and say, “We’ll have a million robotaxis next year,” and the stock jumps 10%. Do we have robotaxis? Nope. But do we have belief? Absolutely.

Tesla isn’t just a car company it’s a hype engine with wheels.

comment,1j0ee91,1j0ee91,,"From the article: This issue arises because the Cybertruck’s powerful single wiper doesn’t always spray enough windshield wiper fluid to break down all the salt kicked up by other vehicles. At highway speeds, salt accumulates rapidly, and it’s even possible for the Cybertruck’s forward camera cluster to get blocked, which may trigger a request for the driver to take over.

The solution to this issue is simple: apply more fluid to the windshield to help break up the salt, which the Giga wiper can then wipe away. Currently, washer fluid is only sprayed during downstrokes, and holding down the wiper button just repeats the cycle. However, according to a post on X by Wes Morril, Cybertruck’s Lead Engineer, that’s about to change.

With the upcoming software update 2025.2.8, which is expected to roll out to Cybertruck owners in the next few days, Tesla has introduced a new feature for the washer button. Now, holding down the button for two full cycles (two sweeps of the wiper) will continuously soak the windshield. This means you’ll be able to apply double the amount of fluid — on upward and downward wiper strokes.

This is a highly requested improvement, particularly from Cybertruck owners in regions where road salt is frequently used during winter. While the winter season is nearing its end in much of North America, this update will be a welcomed improvement for next year’s colder months.",1408,False,1740766742.0,2025-02-28 19:19:02,39,0,chrisdh79,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1j0ee91/tesla_improves_the_cybertruck_wiper_in_software/mfaix2e/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mfaix2e
comment,1j0ee91,1j0ee91,,"Great…..  Now allow us to actually shut the wiper off completely because the false triggers dry wiping and smearing fine salt particles into a solid haze all over the glass is the only reason we need to clean it in the first place.  And yes, I know you can select off in the wiper menu but FSD will turn it right back on when you drive under an overpass and it triggers the wiper for no reason at all.

comment,1j5z8gn,1j5z8gn,,"More than 200 auto dealers across the country were “stiffed” when Tesla “had a run on the bank,” claiming tens of millions of dollars in EV rebates on the last weekend before the government abruptly shut down the public subsidy program in January.

Now these independently owned dealerships are out of pocket an estimated $10 million, having provided 2,295 rebates to customers and expecting to get reimbursed, according to the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association (CADA).

“These dealers in good faith gave customers the money for a program that is always refunded,” said CADA spokesperson Huw Williams. “They shouldn’t be left making a payment on behalf of the Government of Canada.”

The iZEV EV rebate program offered from $2,500 to $5,000 toward the purchase of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. Dealerships provided the rebate to buyers upfront and expected to be reimbursed by the government.

On Jan. 10, as political turmoil embroiled the federal government, Transport Canada informed dealerships that the EV rebate program would run out of money before its scheduled end in March.

“Due to the high uptake, the iZEV Program will be paused in a few weeks,” stated the email sent to dealerships just before noon on the Friday, obtained by the Star.

But that weekend there was an unprecedented surge in claims from four Tesla outlets, the Star revealed this week. The four Tesla showrooms claimed 8,653 EV sales in 72 hours and filed for $43.",3552,True,1741383519.0,2025-03-07 22:38:39,549,0,FourteenthCylon,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j5z8gn/suspicious_tesla_sales_surge_triggers_canadian/mgkxj49/,True,,2025,both,top,False,False,0,mgkxj49
comment,1j5z8gn,1j5z8gn,,"CADA surveyed its 3,500 dealer members to determine how many rebated EVs were sold that didn’t get inputted into the system before the federal government shut it down. Their numbers, which have not been made public, show 226 dealerships provided rebates on 2,295 electric vehicles and have not been reimbursed. This would total more than $10 million, if the breakdown of battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles mirrored all the rebates given out since 2019. 

Williams said one dealership is out of pocket $690,000. The Star spoke with two dealers in Quebec; both pointed out that most Quebec auto dealers are closed on the weekend and therefore were not only unable to sell EVs during the last weekend the rebate program was open, but also weren’t able to file paperwork when they returned to work on the Monday. One of the dealers said he was out $300,000. The other said he had fronted $410,000, and is considering layoffs because of the financial squeeze. 

Terry Budd, who owns eight car dealerships in the Oakville and Hamilton areas, said there was no notice from the government that the iZEV program was coming to an end. Instead, he received an email from CADA informing him the program was running short on funds and advising him to tell his salespeople and customers.

While they hurried to get as many rebates submitted as possible over the weekend, more than a month later, they still haven’t been paid for the 35 EVs and hybrids they sold that weekend.",1961,True,1741383539.0,2025-03-07 22:38:59,181,0,FourteenthCylon,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j5z8gn/suspicious_tesla_sales_surge_triggers_canadian/mgkxlhe/,True,,2025,tesla,top,False,False,0,mgkxlhe

Elon and his brother started a yellow pages like company called Zip2, thanks to investors (including his creepy incestous dad) giving them 200k.

Elon had access to angel investors partially because he did an internship at the Bank of Nova Scotia, where he apparently was able to pitch ideas up the chain to the CEO. You know, normal stuff that poor nobodies with no connections get to do when they do an internship. 

So with a bunch of investors, Elon and three co-founders start X(dot)com. Within a few months, Elon fired one of the co-founders and the other two quit as a result. X(dot)com sucked so bad at banking that:

>In January 2000, it was discovered that a security flaw allowed users of X(dot)com who had the account number and bank routing number of any other bank account, even at other banks, could move money from that other account to their own and withdraw it. The problem existed for a month before it was discovered and corrected. 

And they had a competitor company that did know what they were doing, and was going to beat them, so guess what they did. Elon used his rich friends to just buy up the competitor.

comment,1j9jxzj,1j9jxzj,,"So there's two aspects to this:

The first is that all companies are run by people, and it's a completely natural and right that the people in charge of other EV companies would be horrified by Musk and his antics. The proper human response to nascent fascism is revulsion and opposition.

The second though is that companies get anthromorphized by consumers/audiences so that people see communications from that company (like ads and brand-managed social media posts) as coming from a *person*, rather than a company. People can have very personal responses to this - and interestingly, there is a large segment of the human population that is conflict-adverse over all else. Getting involved in a fight, *even if the cause is righteous* is seen as being ""just as bad"" as fighting for an evil cause. It is the *fight* that is wrong, irrespective of the root cause of the fight.

comment,1jb06ts,1jb06ts,,"From the article: British Columbia has announced that Tesla’s products—including its Powerwall home battery, inverters, and electric vehicle (EV) chargers—will no longer be eligible for rebates under the CleanBC and BC Hydro programs. The province claims this move is part of an effort to support Canadian-made products and reduce reliance on American imports.

However, the revised list of eligible products still includes American-made brands, raising questions about the policy’s consistency and the true motivation behind Tesla’s exclusion.

According to an update posted to the BC Hydro website, the exclusion of Tesla is meant to “preference Canadian goods” and “exclude, where practicable, U.S.-produced goods.” But a quick look at the updated list of eligible products reveals that almost all of the alternatives that remain eligible for rebates are U.S.-based.

In fact, of the companies still listed as eligible, only four are Canadian (FLO, Grizzl-E, Hypercharge, Sun Country Highway), while a whopping 73, or 94.8% of the companies on the list, are from the U.S., according to a review by Grok.

**“The Government of B.C. and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, U.S. produced goods.

comment,1jdbe40,1jdbe40,,"To preface. The last 5 years, I've owned 4 Teslas -- Model 3 SR+, M3 LR, MYP, MYP. I'll be brief, I believe they are good products and I made this decision because I believe it now stands for the wrong thing. Hope my Tesla goes to someone else instead of them buying new. Better to act on your convictions than to not act at all.

I considered the Ioniq 5, EV9, F150 Lightning, Polestar 3, Mach E, Mercedes EQS.

I was looking for something similar to Tesla. I mainly wanted the regen and software to be similar. And from a Tesla owners perspective, the Rivian is very similar, which is great! The regen is even stronger and adjustable.

Some of the other EVs DEFAULT to no regen or low regen. And they never remember your regen settings when you get in, you have to hit the paddles every time! I'm looking at you Kia and Hyundai!

I was not a fan of the software for the F150, Mach E or Mercedes. The layout of the Rivian infotainment is akin to modern tablet OS and has a native spotify app like Tesla. I can even google cast to it, which could arguably be easier than the native youtube app on Tesla. I can cast crunchyroll animes!

And to close this out. It's faster, SOFTER suspension, more versatile, and more luxurious inside.

The stock is headed for an ninth-straight weekly loss, and now sits 53% below the all-time highs reached in mid-December.

As each day passes, the list of headwinds facing the EV maker seems to grow. In addition to existing pressures, Tesla on Tuesday faced fresh competition from China and an analyst price-target cut.

Below are four forces — two new, two evergreen — driving the acceleration in Tesla’s share-price decline.

1. BYD’s new battery tech

The Chinese firm BYD unveiled an EV-charging station that it claims can deliver up to 400 kilometers driving range after just five minutes of charging. This would be a big step up from current charging technology, with Tesla’s quickest version providing a 275-kilometer range after 15 minutes of charging.

The development creates another headwind for Tesla as it tries to break into Chinese market.

BYD plans to build 4,000 of these chargers across China.

2. Wall Street scaling back forecasts

Though RBC maintains an “outperform” rating on Tesla, it cut its price target to $320 from $440.

The analyst Tom Narayan expects lower pricing on Tesla’s full self-driving technology as autonomous offerings become increasingly standard across the EV industry.

comment,1jfw22y,1jfw22y,,"Rivian delivered 51,579 vehicles in 2024. 13,423 were RDVs, so 38,156 R1T and R1S, but mostly R1S. That's 9,539 a quarter on average. 2023 had largely similar numbers (50k total), 2022 had 25k total deliveries. That's somewhere around 90k making some SWAGs about RDVs since it's generally hard to figure out. The biggest problem with all of this is there's several R1Ss sold for every R1T.

Ford sold 33,510 lightnings in 2024 or 8,377 a quarter. Add 2022 (15.6k) and 2023 (24k) sales and about 73k lightnings have been sold on an upward trend.

TL;DR: There are more R1 vehicles than cybertrucks but more cybertrucks than R1Ts. Lightnings appear to generally be the best selling EV truck. Cybertrucks briefly outsold everyone, peaking at a rate of 15k a quarter for at least a month but that seems to have ended.

ETA: using the 1:3 ratio of R1S:R1T from the report linked by SPorterBridges, that's roughly 31k R1Ts, probably the 46k cybertrucks from the recall and. 73k lightnings, and 126k total R1 vehicles.

comment,1jhbcbb,1jhbcbb,,"There are a lot of ways to approach this question, I’ll try this one.

There are 3 things you need to understand for this to make sense:
1: For the most part, people speak and act according to how things make them feel, and we use our logical reasoning less than we think we do, unless the individual is aware of this and has taken appropriate measures to correct it. They speak and respond affirmatively towards things they feel like are good or they agree with (usually in regards to whether it tracks with their internal perception of the world, which is a horribly subjective and unreliable thing)

2: Common sources of information in America are woefully dishonest as they use a mixture of unreliable primary sources and emotional appeals to spread the narrative they want people to believe. People tend to think major news outlets like CNN and MSNBC support the democrats and Fox supports the republicans. That’s really an oversimplification and frankly outdated, since it’s more complicated now and people are also experiencing social echo chambers that radicalize them.

3: In the left wing world where people supported Kamala, Elon has been vilified for several years now, ever since he bought Twitter (which he claimed to have done in part to fight censorship); because Trump won with Elon’s support, they are angry that “the enemy” won, and are acting emotionally, and lashing out against something they associate with Elon.",1715,True,1742669373.0,2025-03-22 19:49:33,2,0,Hiscabibbel,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/1jhbcbb/explain_it_to_me_like_im_10/mj6rwz6/,True,,2025,elon,hot,False,False,0,mj6rwz6

comment,1jizskm,1jizskm,,"Two ways to see it.

The first is he is using ""empathy"" to mean ""actions taken in the name of empathy"".  There are a great number of really bad ideas that sound like you are being nice.  I made a list a little while ago, but I would like to think that most people know what I am talking about.  Giving money to an alcoholic because you feel bad for him might seem nice, but is probably helping to feed his addiction and eventually end his life.  We have a lot of that going on right now, and this was the way I thought he meant it.

The second way, and the way I am starting to understand it, is that our empathy is being used against us.  It's related to the first, but is more that somebody will try to force you to agree with them by using guilt trips.  When a beggar tells you that you have to give them money or else you are hurting them, this is using our empathy as a vulnerability.

Or another example: when your child claims you don't love them if you won't let them go to a party, that is a trivial example of an attempt to use empathy against you.  

And of course this tactic has not gone unnoticed on a geopolitical scale. 

This is not new.  I think you would agree with that, right?  What \*is\* new is the sheer scale of the current attempts to use it against us, and the almost laughably transparent lack of any real argument that would perhaps bolster empathy as a legitimate persuasion technique.

comment,1jjg3qn,1jjg3qn,,"You brave soul. I’ll try…

The lefts main argument is that he is an unelected official affecting government policy (ie not confirmed by the senate). These actions are causing government agencies to be shuddered and public funding to be slashed at local communities (ie departments of education, department that funds public libraries, parks and wildlife, etc). 

There are plenty of counter arguments, my first being that there are articles that allow private citizens to give goods and services to government for free (like software and service), which is what Elon is doing, to identify waste and fraud in many agencies. So, essentially they have circumvented Elon being confirmed by the senate. This is good because this allows the government to allow quickly without being bogged down by the swamp of judges, media, and politics. 

I believe if people spent some time listening to other viewpoints and understood the goal of this administration, while also listening to the other side, they would be more inclined to cheer the wins and still be honest enough to point out the short comings (which there have been).

comment,1jk95cu,1jk95cu,,"From the article: The Canadian government has frozen $43 million in electric vehicle (EV) rebate payments owed to Tesla and declared the automaker ineligible for all future iZEV (Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles) programs, citing a combination of trade tensions and concerns over potential misuse of the program.

The decision was confirmed by Chrystia Freeland, who was recently appointed as Transport Minister. According to Freeland, the freeze was ordered before the election was called, and payments will remain suspended until every claim submitted by Tesla is reviewed individually.

“No payments will be made until we are confident that the claims are valid,” said Freeland in a statement to the Tornoto Star. “I also directed my department to change the eligibility criteria for future iZEV programs to ensure that Tesla vehicles will not be eligible for incentives so long as the illegitimate and illegal U.S. tariffs are imposed against Canada.”

The move comes in response to a last-minute surge in rebate claims submitted by Tesla in the final days of the iZEV program. According to government data, Tesla filed thousands of claims in just 72 hours that exhausted the remaining funds in the program nearly overnight. While many are claiming Tesla abused the program, the more likely scenario is that Tesla rushed to file claims for cars it had already sold, but not yet sought the rebate.",1760,True,1742987213.0,2025-03-26 12:06:53,66,0,chrisdh79,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1jk95cu/canada_freezes_43_million_in_tesla_ev_kickbacks/mjtb0bc/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mjtb0bc

Tesla is not a traditional dealership, in that they operate their own stores.  This could be something as simple as ""Tesla had a paperwork backlog and funneled everything through this one store"" or it can be Tesla straight up abusing the rebate system.

The reality is that no one knows what happened, just that it did, and every time another province excludes Tesla, they bring up this story as an ""explanation"" of ""one of the reasons"" why this is happening, but as of yet, we don't know the specifics behind what Tesla was doing with the rebates.

It *looks* shady, but let's not forget that the internet was *ablaze* about how [Tesla ""lost"" $1.4 billion dollars](https://archive.ph/Au7wY), and now the publication has [written a retraction](https://archive.ph/evAlg) regarding it.

*Bad news* about Tesla will always get more click and attention than good news, because that's how people feel about Tesla at the moment.

And in that time, Elon made the engineering challenge around FSD substantially more difficult with the decision to remove radar. All so they could navigate sensor shortages and still make deliveries.

For me, I absolutely despise the fact that if I want to go faster, I have to change the behavior to standard or hurry, but then it makes more lane changes. All I want, and probably most everyone, is the ability to have the card drive faster while still keeping lane changes minimal. On top of that, there are times I wanted to stay in the left lane or the right lane, but it will constantly make changes to stay out of those lanes, which is infuriating. No matter how good it gets, we will also have preferences on where we want to be.

comment,1jk7if2,1jk7if2,,"This is what I got back from Grok:

""Billionaires can have a significant impact on society, both positive and negative, depending on how they use their wealth and influence. Here are some potential benefits they can bring:

1. **Economic Growth and Job Creation**: Many billionaires build companies that employ thousands—or even millions—of people. Think of entrepreneurs like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, whose ventures (Tesla, SpaceX, Amazon) have created jobs and driven innovation in tech, logistics, and space exploration. Their investments can stimulate economies, especially in emerging industries.

2. **Innovation and Problem-Solving**: Wealth at that scale often funds risky, ambitious projects that governments or smaller entities might not tackle. For example, Musk’s push for sustainable energy or Gates’ work on global health through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation show how billionaires can accelerate progress on big challenges.

3. **Philanthropy**: Some billionaires redirect their fortunes into solving societal problems. Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, via the Giving Pledge, encourage billionaires to donate most of their wealth to causes like education, healthcare, and poverty reduction. This can fill gaps where public funding falls short.

comment,1jm8bn2,1jm8bn2,,"I think there’s 2 groups of xAI shareholders to consider.

Firstly, the hands-off Investors - these are the same people who helped Musk pay for the last 10% of Twitter in 2022 that he wasn’t going to personally pay for or use loans for. As X went down in value in 2022/2023, and xAI was getting started, these investors were given the ability to invest in xAI in its very early stages in 2023. They have made a ton already by getting that early access to invest in xAI in the seed round. Everybody wanted to pay to invest in xAI in 2023 when it was super cheap, but only a select few were given the opportunity.

They probably just want to maintain a good relationship with Musk so they can get in early in future ventures of his, since that is so valuable. They also defer these decisions to him because they trust him to create value. They are happily hitched to the Musk train.

Secondly, the Employees who have received stock in xAI as part of their salary compensation. They are probably the most likely to be annoyed at this deal, but at the same time, Musk being Musk is how xAI got started in the first place, how the talent was attracted and the team formed, and how it gained the Tweet data and Grok placement in the X app, leading it to its current 80B valuation. 

They probably don’t like this deal on its own, but hitching their wagon to Musk is working out for them in general.",2476,True,1743235354.0,2025-03-29 09:02:34,14,0,NotGonnaLie59,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/1jm8bn2/xai_ceo_elon_musk_buys_x_from_ceo_elon_musk_for/mkbqb9s/,True,,2025,both,hot,False,False,0,mkbqb9s
comment,1jm8bn2,1jm8bn2,,"There have been a lot of numbers thrown around about the value of Twitter the last couple years. It’s confusing because people often don’t mention the 12b of debt and how that factors in to the numbers they’re mentioning. 

In the middle of 2022, Musk was trying to pull out of the deal, claiming Twitter had significantly undercounted the number of bot accounts. He said at 44b he was “obviously overpaying”. A court forced him to complete the transaction though.

So in October 2022, the old Twitter shareholders received 44b (actual money), which was funded by like 29b from Musk, like 3b from other investors, and then they the new company X took on 12b of debt to complete the deal. Musk probably gave a personal guarantee to the banks or offered collateral, but it was X’s debt to pay back on a day to day basis. X was paying the interest on that debt. Musk was just the safety net for it.

The best way to look at it, old Twitter did not have this 12B debt, but new Twitter did, so even if it was worth 44B at the time of sale, it was instantly worth 32B the day after the sale once new Twitter had all this debt on its books.

Since we know Musk overpaid at 44B (everybody agrees), we could subtract like (guessing here) 6B more to account for what a fair price would actually be. So that puts the value down to like 26B the day after it was purchased for 44B.",3024,True,1743238878.0,2025-03-29 10:01:18,67,0,NotGonnaLie59,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/1jm8bn2/xai_ceo_elon_musk_buys_x_from_ceo_elon_musk_for/mkbve4d/,True,,2025,elon,hot,False,False,0,mkbve4d

comment,1jo5rr7,1jo5rr7,,"Full story:

""70-year-old Meridian man faces aggravated battery charges after allegedly striking a counter-protester with his vehicle during dueling demonstrations outside a Tesla dealership Saturday.

Christopher Talbot was arrested after police said he made an obscene gesture toward a 49-year-old man and then hit him with his car during protests at the dealership on Franklin Road. The incident occurred on March 29 around 1 p.m. amid tensions between protesters opposing Elon Musk's political activities and a larger group supporting the billionaire businessman.

About 30 protesters attended the ""Tesla Takedown"" demonstration organized by groups called Troublemakers and The Disruption Project. At the same time, close to 200 counter-protesters mobilized by the Idaho Liberty Dogs appeared in support of Musk and the dealership. 

According to the Meridian Police Department (MPD), the victim had been driving a truck displaying pro-Trump flags and had just parked and exited his vehicle when Talbot allegedly struck him. The victim recorded Talbot's license plate before driving himself to a local hospital, where he was treated and released for non-life-threatening injuries.

The original protest targeted Musk's involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency, nicknamed DOGE. Organizers claimed on social media that ""Elon Musk is destroying our democracy, and he's using the fortune he built from Tesla to do it. We are taking action at Tesla to stop Musk's illegal coup.",1920,True,1743453513.0,2025-03-31 22:38:33,12,0,berevasel,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/1jo5rr7/msn_idaho_man_arrested_after_allegedly_hitting/mkqxg2p/,True,,2025,both,hot,False,False,0,mkqxg2p

i don't like trump at all and think that his economic model is absolutely stupid. but i also feel like comparing the great depression and the DJI tanking 90% isn't good history... like trump use of mckinley when it comes to tariffs. 

the global market (and regulation too) is far past the point of a great depression happening. while the US is doing it's best to outright gut everything in regulation, in 1930s america there was practically no social net, no digital economy, no FDIC, not even fucking social security lmfao. that is why the smoot-hawley furthered the depression into unimaginable levels.

comment,1jqyy5b,1jqyy5b,,">All these companies are going to see their share of business done outside the United States plummet

I do wonder about this. For the most part, anyone outside the US doing business with Apple and Google and Microsoft aren't trading with those companies' US entities; they're contracting with legal entities in Ireland or elsewhere. There is no part of an iPhone that is made in the US except the IP, and that can be transfer priced in very creative ways. AWS and Microsoft have data centres all over the world. Everything NVIDIA makes is physically produced in Taiwan. And Teslas sold in Australia (rapid sales volume drop notwithstanding) are built in China. 

These companies (except maybe Tesla) aren't stupid. None of them are going to want to go down with the ship, and they will find ways to protect their interests. And customers are mostly rational too: Unless Tim Cook starts doing Musk salutes nobody is setting their iPhone on fire.

comment,1jtlvn7,1jtlvn7,,"From the article: Tesla has made a significant update to its Safety Score, removing one of the most controversial metrics – Forward Collision Warnings (FCW)- from the system’s formula. The removal of FCW comes as the company is dealing with a potential class action lawsuit claiming the metric artificially inflated insurance premiums.

Tesla first introduced its Safety Score system to Tesla Insurance in 2021. The system uses real-time driving telemetry to determine scores for several metrics, such as Hard Braking, Aggressive Turning, and more, all of which combine into one overall Safety Score. This score is then used to determine your monthly Tesla Insurance premiums. If you have a good, or high, Safety Score you get a lower insurance premium than someone who has a low Safety Score.

There was one metric that was particularly controversial, and that was FCW. According to Tesla, FCWs were triggered “in events where a possible collision due to an object in front of the vehicle is considered likely without driver intervention.” However, ask any Tesla owner and they will say the FCW system is far from perfect, often giving out false positives when there was no real danger of a collision.

It was enough of a problem that one owner from Illinois filed a potential class action lawsuit against the company, claiming customers were being overcharged on their monthly insurance premiums based on these false warnings.",1738,True,1744034353.0,2025-04-07 15:59:13,83,0,chrisdh79,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1jtlvn7/tesla_removes_forward_collision_warnings_from/mlv432s/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mlv432s

comment,1jtlvn7,1jtlvn7,,"Good, FCW is worthless for this purpose. Don't get me wrong, as a safety feature it's great, and it SHOULD be generally over-protective.

But if you use it to determine premiums, it has to be near-perfect, and arguably it should err towards false negative rather than false positives, which is what it does today.

In our neighborhood, there are a few lazily-curving streets with parallel parking, and even taking it at/below the 15-25mph speed limit, each day we get 4-5 FCW panic beeps from the Model X as it reliably mistakes a parked car on the side of the road for one it thinks we are going to hit, even though that car is clearly off the projected path.

The last 5% is what took Waymo and others years and years to close that gap. This is one field where the last 5% takes 95% of the time.

If you are experiencing *any* disengagement at all, then it's years away from where it needs to be to be fully autonomous on public roads.

If one day the whole Tesla community are all saying they are not seeing *any* disengagement for months at a time, then we know we are close.

comment,1jtv8dx,1jtv8dx,,"That's incorrect. The accident rate while manually driving is actually much higher than the accident rate while using FSD. Why? Because not only has FSD itself become a much more competent driver over time, but also because you can intervene when necessary, and it effectively becomes like having two sets of eyes and brains driving at the same time, where one can catch the other's mistakes. So if you were truly concerned about your life and other people's lives, you'd want to be using FSD. It is factually safer than manually driving.

Also, you're acting as if you must fully rely on FSD. No, you can take over. Eventually it will be good enough where you can fully rely on it, but we're not there yet.

This was always a problem for them.  And when he would not go along with their version of the world, it just caused them to boil over.  And when he actually started doing work in a Republican administration, that was pretty much it.

The problem they now have is that they no longer control the narrative.  The good ole standards do not work anymore.  The media fortress they built has crumbled and now everyone is free to make up their own mind.  They cannot paper over the violence in their own ranks, the lack of leadership, or how it all pales in comparison to what the Elon Musks of the world can do.  All they can do is scream.

If a recession hit, *most* companies are going to scale back their high price items. Not many will buy in that type of market.

comment,1jz3t3i,1jz3t3i,,"That’s a fair question, but they actually use very different approaches.

Waymo is built around pre-existing, highly detailed map knowledge and localizes itself within that map to execute driving decisions. Tesla FSD is designed to dynamically perceive and respond to the environment without relying on prior mapping.

This difference directly impacts generalization.

* With a system based on pre-mapped environments, deployment becomes slow and expensive because every operational area needs to be mapped, validated, and continuously revalidated.
* A system that dynamically perceives and adapts can theoretically scale indefinitely, which is why FSD has already been deployed broadly, including its expansion into China.

There are pros and cons to each approach:

* Pre-existing map knowledge can provide very strong performance initially within its operational domain.
* Dynamic perception is harder to perfect but ultimately more flexible and scalable.

So while legal and policy constraints do affect Waymo, it’s likely not the only reason they are limited to specific areas. Their core technical approach inherently makes large-scale generalization and rapid deployment much harder.",1190,False,1744668283.0,2025-04-15 00:04:43,3,0,standardphysics,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1jz3t3i/tesla_rt_elonmusk_for_the_first_time_there_will/mn4wqxc/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mn4wqxc

If it rolls over (more common for that period of time American made cars had odometers that only went 5 digits), have to include that. Not to mention mileage is recorded by corporations and self employed people as part of business expenses. Even accuracy is regulated and they need to be within 5-10% of actual without the manufacturer getting in serious trouble.

But objectively speaking, Waymo is currently driving autonomously, while Tesla is not.

All of this stuff about ""scalability"" is just a momentary distraction.  Sure, tesla has shown they can build factories, and pump out vehicles at scale.  But how many Cybercabs have been mass produced to date?

comment,1kn6wgq,1kn6wgq,,"Since I don't know much about existing laws in SA, I had to ask Gemini about it. This is what the response was:

Elon Musk's claim touches on a complex and highly debated issue in South Africa. Here's a breakdown of the situation:  



* **Historical Context:**
   * South Africa has a deeply troubled history of racial segregation and discrimination under the apartheid regime.  
   * Since the end of apartheid in 1994, the government has implemented various policies aimed at addressing the legacy of past injustices and promoting equality. These policies often involve affirmative action measures.  
* **Affirmative Action and Current Laws:**
   * South Africa has laws like the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) Act and the Employment Equity Act, which aim to redress past economic imbalances by giving preference to previously disadvantaged groups, primarily black South Africans.  
   * These laws can, in certain circumstances, result in what some perceive as discrimination against non-black individuals.
* **The Claim of 142 Discriminatory Laws:**
   * The claim that South Africa has ""passed 142 laws forcing discrimination against anyone who is not black"" seems to originate from research by the Institute of Race Relations (IRR), a South African think tank.
   * The IRR has identified numerous pieces of legislation, regulations, and policies that they argue contain race-based criteria, often in the context of affirmative action and Black Economic Empowerment.",2871,True,1747312956.0,2025-05-15 14:42:36,60,0,_tube_,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/1kn6wgq/elon_south_africa_has_now_passed_142_laws_forcing/msfu8s4/,True,,2025,elon,hot,False,False,0,msfu8s4
comment,1kn6wgq,1kn6wgq,,"I am far from an expert in South Africa, with what I know from news and former South African co-workers, Elon Musk’s recent comments aren’t entirely out of line with the current situation. South Africa today faces serious challenges, including widespread corruption, persistent governance issues, and policies that some argue result in discrimination against white citizens. Even when the policies themselves are defensible in principle, they’re frequently distorted by a system plagued by corruption and mismanagement.

With that said, Elon Musk is probably missing one key thing beyond his race: he likely needs to grease the right wheels to be granted a license in South Africa. The people who succeed in modern South Africa don't just need to be black, they often have to have the right connections and be willing to pay officials. I think it is fair to say that the current state of South Africa is a disgrace to what Nelson Mandela was trying to create.

I'm not trying to pick a side on this issue, just pointing out that South Africa is not a high-trust pluralistic country like most developed nations people on Reddit are likely familiar with. They're a country that struggles with providing basic necessities (like electricity to their citizens) and has issues with widespread crime due to how they're government is currently managed.",1536,True,1747324688.0,2025-05-15 17:58:08,11,0,Chemical_Signal2753,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/1kn6wgq/elon_south_africa_has_now_passed_142_laws_forcing/msgvp4q/,True,,2025,elon,hot,False,False,0,msgvp4q

Even while paying for grad school, I am still saving a decent amount each month from my paycheck, it's just not that much when I factor in the cost of classes.

That being said, it can be risky. At that point because of general wear and tear it's a matter of when and how frequently things will go wrong, not if. Also, parts can start becoming an issue after about 15 years. It got to the point where I was having transmission problems on my old vehicle (yes it was maintained) and would regularly have small things break (ex power window regulator here, door lock there). Sometimes, like when my wiper arm snapped in half, the part just didn't exist anymore, even aftermarket, so I had to call 20 different pull-a-part places to see if they had a the same vehicle in stock with a build date of after January 2005 but before the 2008 model year with the passenger side wiper arm intact to find a wiper arm.

This.  As derisive as Tesla is at the moment, you can't argue their charging network.  But even here,  most chargers aren't that near airports. Not knowing how long it'll take to charge or how busy the charger is doesn't help either when there's a flight you need to catch.   

And this is the easiest to use option.  

CCS in North America? 
Deposits that have to be made in an app you have to download with chargers being broken constantly or that have 1 stall that's full.   I wouldn't wish that on anyone.    

I regularly rented Tesla because they were cheap.  They offered me a bolt once and I refused.  Even if the car was excellent the charging network is not, especially since I didn't bring any RFID cards with me.

comment,1kqg2i5,1kqg2i5,,"Retaining 90% capacity after 7000 hours of cycling at 40C would be incredible.

For reference, my 2.5 year old LFP Model 3 is already down to around 94-96% capacity, depending on how you measure, after only 631 hours of driving, which equates to 23.5k miles. So 7000 hours of cycling is probably in the 200k-300k miles ballpark, potentially more if you do mostly highway driving.

Edit: I should note, however, that even for current LFP batteries, most of the degradation seems to be from calendar aging, not cyclical (usage-based) aging, so other LFP Tesla owners with 2.5 year old cars likely have similar remaining capacity to me, regardless of whether they drove 5k miles or 50k miles.

comment,1kqzthf,1kqzthf,,"Huh, TIL Elon was a MS intern. He was also a banking intern: 

>While studying physics at Queen’s University in Canada during the early 1990s, Musk and his brother Kimbal cold-called numerous people they wanted to meet, including Peter Nicholson, a top executive at the Bank of Nova Scotia. Nicholson “was not in the habit of getting out-of-the-blue requests,” according to Ashlee Vance’s book “Elon Musk,” and he was impressed. As he put it, “I was perfectly prepared to have lunch with a couple of kids that had that kind of gumption.”

>Nicholson gave Musk a summer internship at the bank, where he earned about $14 an hour and got to pitch new ideas to his boss. For one project, Musk told Vance, he wrote up a proposal for a bond trade that he estimated could be “the biggest opportunity ever, and nobody seemed to realize.” His boss approved the pitch and passed it along to the bank’s CEO but, to Musk’s dismay, the CEO rejected the proposal.

>“Later in life, as I competed against the banks, I would think back to this moment, and it gave me confidence. All the bankers did was copy what everyone else did,” Musk told Vance. “If there was a giant pile of gold sitting in the middle of the room and nobody was picking it up, they wouldn’t pick it up either.”

>One of Musk’s takeaways was that “bankers are rich and dumb,” he told Vance, and he kept that in mind when, in 1999, Musk launched his finance start up X.com. The site merged with Confinity in 2000 and became PayPal.

Grok is constantly farming raw data both from its search index and from people who use X/twitter, which is a constant feed of new information by people who are just using X to discuss things.

It stands to reason to me that Grok has an inherent advantage because its AI is constantly being trained on relevant conversations.

I don't know about AI benchmarks, but if Elon didn't have any involvement I think Grok might be more popular.",781,False,1747778455.0,2025-05-21 00:00:55,4,0,atomic1fire,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/1kqzthf/elon_musk_talked_with_microsoft_ceo_satya_nadella/mtdenua/,True,,2025,elon,hot,False,False,0,mtdenua

I just wish powerwalls were cheaper.  3 miles away in a different state they cost $4k rather than 11k.

comment,1krw9j8,1krw9j8,,"From the article: Elon Musk says he intends to remain CEO of Tesla for at least the next five years, while saying the company is not experience issues with demand, expect in one market. The comments came during a video interview at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday, where Musk responded to questions about his political involvement, leadership at Tesla, and the company’s recent sales figures.

When asked directly if he saw himself continuing as Tesla’s CEO in five years’ time, Musk answered with a simple “Yes.” Pressed further, he added with a laugh, “I can’t be still here if I’m dead.”

Musk’s statements on his continued leadership comes amid growing scrutiny over his political ties and time commitments to projects beyond Tesla, including the U.S. government’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Along with his involvement in DOGE, Musk has donated at least $250 million in support of Trump’s re-election campaign, but that appears to be over, at least for now. Musk said, “I’ve done enough.

comment,1kso4c9,1kso4c9,,"I'm too poor for a model S, but if I was a buyer I would want: 

- front bumper camera, interior lighting ( we know it's coming)

- bigger battery: right now the model S has a 90/100 kWh battery, let's put in the CT battery, so a 120-125kwh, so that it also get's ahead of the lucid and a no-compromise 300 mile/500 km range.

It would also help with towing on the model X

- even faster on the plaid trim

Aka I want the specs that Tesla unveiled for the plaid+ in 2021

- more colors, we really need a dark green ( like the Alfa Romeo one, there was also a model 3 wrap that looked stunning)

- self presenting/soft closing doors

- automatic frunk open/close

- elettro-obscurable roof glass, like the taycan.

comment,1ktjam4,1ktjam4,,"excellent write up! Thanks for taking the time. Here is the bear case. I used to own shares, but I am now so disgusted with Elon that I can't directly own anything he controls.  I am also very skeptical of Tesla FSD as I believe that Waymo LIDAR, which I have driven, is much safer. Just a matter of time before there is a bad accident with a Tesla autonomous vehicle, especially in rain or fog. That said, Ives has just given him a street high PT of $500 so there are big analysts out there who buy into the FSD and Optimus AI vision.

Bear Case

Given the negative public sentiment towards Tesla vehicles as part of Musk's participation with the Department of Government Efficiency \[DOGE\], the robotaxi program may be a risky endeavor given that the vehicles will be unsupervised on the road. Though I do not expect it to impact the program, there is the potential for vandalism and theft of the vehicles while on the road, potentially hindering the test phase, pushing out the mass adoption phase.

Industrial robotics may be a narrower market than anticipated, given the purpose-built robots on the market today.

* **Hyundai** (via Boston Dynamics): Although Hyundai is listed in Korea, acquiring Boston Dynamics puts them in a strong position in advanced mobility robots.
* **Figure AI**: Still private, but very promising in humanoid robotics. Backed by Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia.

# 2. Industrial robotics

This is currently the most mature and profitable segment:

* **ABB Ltd (ABB)**: Swiss company with a global presence in automation and industrial robotics.
* **Fanuc (FANUY)**: Japanese leader in industrial robotics, especially factory automation.
* **Yaskawa Electric (YASKY)**: Another major Japanese player focused on automation and industrial robots.
* **KUKA**: German robotics company now owned by China's Midea Group, so not directly listed.
* **Rockwell Automation (ROK)**: More focused on automation but includes key robotics components for smart factories.

# 3. Other related areas

* **Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)**: Leader in medical robotics with its Da Vinci surgical system.
* **iRobot (IRBT)**: Known for Roomba. Less cutting-edge, but still robotics-related.
* **Nvidia (NVDA)**: Doesn’t build robots but provides critical AI and computer vision hardware/software (Jetson, CUDA, etc.).

 To me that makes them the clear front runner. Even if Tesla offers one for $20k, Amazon might be able to offer something comparable for $10,000, have more integration, and have a much better platform to get it to people at a lower cost.

comment,1ktff15,1ktff15,,"No trains are incredibly more efficient. A highspeed train travelling at 300 kmph ( 187.5 mph) consumes only 30 Wh/seat km. Compared to a Tesla model 3 travelling at 75 mph consumes 45 Wh/seat kilometer.

You can run shorter but frequent trains in less less busy lines. 

You can attach or seperate 2 trams according to the demand.

Also metro trains have less occupancy during night times and middays when there are a lot more clean energy being curtailed. Take for example Newyork subway. During night times there are a lot more wind and nuclear energy. So you are using energy that would otherwise go to waste.

Energy efficiency is not the only thing you should cars about. Space efficiency is another thing. A bus only needs 2 passengers to be more space efficient than a car. 

You need a lots of road surface constructed for cars. It emits 10,605.2 ton per lane kilometer of road. Asphalt is very carbon intensive and it's made from oil.

And then a car has an average occupancy of 1.5 per car. It's even lower for urban roads. Only 1.2 per car.

And you didn't count how much CO2 would be emttied to make a car. How much energy needed to produce a car. A car uses a lots of aluminum, steel and plastic. A car's average lifetime is only 12 years compare that to a train which has an average lifetime of 40 years. Some trains last even longer. There are 100 year old trams still working in Lisbon.

comment,1ktff15,1ktff15,,"Buses still takes less energy per person though.

A 12 meter electric bus consumes 1 kWh per km. With 12 people per bus it would only be 78.8 Wh/km. Also don't forget 84% of UK population lives in England. And 13.5% of UK population lives in London.

Also you need much less resources if everyone used buses. Take for example Shenzen which has a 100% electric bus fleet. There are only one bus per 800 people.  You would need atleast 1 car per 4 people if everyone used cars. Let's see how much battery you would need for people using cars vs buses. An electric bus has a battery of 350 kWh at most. They can have much less battery with pantograph charging in terminals. Even if we assumed 350 kWh it's only 437.5 Wh per person. Electric car on the other hand would need 15,000 Wh/person or even more like 60,000 Wh/person. 

Also there's a reason you are not talking about trains here. All you talk about is buses. A highspeed train travelling at 300 kmph (187.5 mph) only consumes only 30 Wh/passenger km.

comment,1ku94ha,1ku94ha,,"Shorting TSLA has been my best investment ever. Here are my tricks.


1) Don't literally short it. Buy ETFs like TSLS, TSLZ, and TSLQ. I prefer the 1x ETFs unless I have extremely high conviction. 


2) Be patient. Really patient. Wait for it to hit overbought areas on the RSI. Don't chase bad days.


3) Take your gains. TSLA always throws out some bullshit eventually so if you are up a decent amount on the day or week just take the win. Do not hold long.


4) Watch the news. Pay attention to macro and micro things that impact the market. If there is an overall bull sentiment, TSLA will go up. Don't fight it. Just wait for it to get overbought. Understand when TSLA sales numbers come out, and when earnings are coming up.


5) Never hold through earnings. At least not your full position. You can trade during ER but don't hold through. TSLA usually sells off slowly ahead of earnings and bad news gets ""priced in"". That's why it bounces back.


6) Pretend like TSLA is in fact a $400 or $500 stock and ignore logic. Everything will make more sense. If it sells off to $200 it will seem like it can go lower (it might), but make your decisions assuming the dumbest and most corrupt rich people in the world think it's a $500 stock.

A significant majority of the democratic subset won’t buy Tesla while Musk is still involved. A minority of that group, however, will still buy if the car is good and it makes sense economically. 

Republicans aren’t a very EV-friendly group but I suspect those who will buy an EV will look at Tesla very favorably considering Musk’s massive investments in getting Republicans elected. 

The dgaf politically group will buy whatever car makes sense for them. There might be a small % that will hesitate due to the whole “Roman” salute situation but it’s likely a very small subset since the mainstream media basically shrugged it off.

First is all v1 and v2 150kw Superchargers. They only charge Teslas.

Next are v3 and v4 250kw Superchargers. These can charge non-Teslas if you have an adapter and Tesla's permission. Jeep does not right now.

The final class are v4 supercharger with an embedded adapter. Any EV can use these.

The final group is the only one that you can use.

The charging universe is not only Tesla. EVGo and electrify America have been on the scene for awhile. Lately I've been using Rivian Adventure Network chargers. Start with a tap of a credit card and super fast.

Just look for other chargers too is my advice. Use plugshare.com to search for chargers in the area where you are going.

Should I hold off until late June for potentially better end-of-quarter deals? Also, based on my usage, would the Model 3 or Model Y be the better daily driver?

I'm not sure if you're asking about aftermarket wheels? But cheapest option would be to just go with the wheels Tesla provides. You can get cheap aftermarket rim guard things if you are really worried about curb rash. 

As for tires, Tesla's OEM tires are typically pretty pricey. But I've never had trouble finding tires with the same rating for about half the price as what Tesla puts on.

comment,1kw5vg4,1kw5vg4,,"Michelin Pilot Sport 4S. 

But the type of tire doesn't matter for your purposes, I'd recommend looking for a Model S that comes with the 19"" wheels, those wheels a) have plastic covers that actually go over the wheels, they're easily replaceable so no need to worry about curb rash and b) have lots of affordable tires that can be slightly oversized from the factory tires.  Example, the 19s are OEM size 255/45/19 in the front. When I bought my car I got winter tires that were sized 265/45/19 (fronts), this was a little wider and gave PLENTY of protection of the rim.

All in all, if I were you, I just would stick with the factory wheels, put aside ~$500 for wheel rash repair, and stick with factory tire sizes.

Tesla is like the iPhone. When it came out, a lot of people wanted buttons again. So a lot of people would not leave Blackberry or they would get a Gen 1 Android phone ie the HTC G1. Over time it seems like most if not all Android device makers have moved to everything on screen with very little buttons like an iPhone.

comment,1kwulr6,1kwulr6,,"People are giving you incomplete answers here.

What you noticed probably isn't magic or a placebo.

On Teslas, if the alignment data is reset in the service menu, the car ""forgets"" where the center point of the alignment ""actually physically is"", and sets back to 0 degrees relative to the steering column. Over the next 5, 10, 20, 50 miles, the car keeps track of the position of the steering wheel when the car is driving straight and applies an offset to the value, which adjusts where the car sees it's home/base steering position value. This affects the pull of the steering wheel. This is so that if the steering wheel is off by 1 or 2 degrees, the car won't forever ""pull"" to straighten the wheel out. It'll learn exactly what position the steering wheel must be in for the car to go perfectly straight, and will pull toward that position.

Let's say your tesla had a learned steering offset of -2 degrees. You might not even realize. Car drives perfectly straight with no pull left or right. Then you hit a pothole and bend something or mess something up, and now the ""real center point"" of the steering in order to go down the road straight is more like PLUS 2 degrees instead of minus 2 degrees. The steering wheel is going to be pulling to one side when you let go of the wheel. If somebody went in and RESET that learned steering offset value, now it's back to ""0"" and the steering wheel is going to be pulling to that side HALF as badly.",2459,True,1748371059.0,2025-05-27 20:37:39,22,0,Douche_Baguette,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kwulr6/could_my_tesla_have_fixed_its_own_alignment/muk8kje/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,muk8kje

Doesn’t mean I won’t criticize him, but I do so on things that are real not hoax-based.

He’s definitely been showing his ass a lot more within the past year.  His shilling for Musk and Trump is pathetic.  He’s proven many times over the years he knows better, so the current views are an appeal to cult populism.

The biggest lie abiut him is regarding his returns.  On Wall Street, his performance was legitimately excellent.  He averaged something like 24-27% *after* fees, for over 15 years.  That doesn’t happen by luck.  His major calls since retiring would have made you an 8 figure millionaire.  That’s possibly why he spews such overconfidence in things like TSLA and AAPL.  Put simply, they’ve been major multi-bagger successful stories for him, so from his perspective, why not?

He’s a genius in multiple subject areas which is probably what made him a narcissist.  One such area is market whispering, and that has helped his results through some legendary “sell all” calls in which he’s kept his portfolios from getting whacked down to the average.  

He’s made many big and powerful enemies, and they’re the source of 98% of the criticism you’ve absorbed.  

I can defend his performance and motives and his “calls”, and I can comprehensively debunk his assailants.

My car had a crack in the sunroof that I missed during delivery. Fortunately Tesla replaced it free.

* Do a thorough walk through. Make a list or find one online.
* If this is your first EV consider the costs for charger installation Nema or wall charger. Will the car come with a mobile charger? Mine did not so I paid like $300 for mobile and $515 for wall charger plus install.

This is my first EV and during my research 90% of Tesla owners recommended percentage (seems to be consistent with the comments here). That’s what I’m using however it did take some getting used to. 

*Tip: while learning your vehicle, take it on a trip and see how the percentage/mileage changes as you accelerate. Be sure to use GPS. Then try to get to a steady speed and see how consistent it becomes. The percentage/mileage for your trip will become more accurate and you will know that the change/accuracy for the GPS is in your control. Not much different than any other car. Higher RPM’s means you’re buring more gas/mile. The Tesla doesn’t exactly have this gauge, at least not in my model 3.

I think this is the real kicker here. 

While the sales decline worldwide (especially in the US) has *some* to do with Elon's salute and his time at Doge,  I think other factors have contributed much more to it. Tesla's sales have been shrinking for the past two years.

A very limited and aging lineup, 3/5 of which are out of the reach of the average person has played a big role. More people want SUVs over sedans, so Tesla is effectively competing with just one model. I don't think the refresh was significant enough for people to want to upgrade.

I too believe that nobody thinks of them as the technology leader anymore which is why the competition has been able to gain a foothold. 

Their tech is still better than the competition in North America in the sense that everything just works and works seamlessly, lag free, but I don't think that's gonna cut it anymore.

comment,1kx7hp9,1kx7hp9,,"This is true.  I just did the used card EV credit.  Here is what you need.
1. Car cannot be more than $25000, not counting tax, title and license (all that other crap counts towards the $25000 limit)
2. Your taxable income for the year you are applying for (you can retro apply it to last year) can't be more than $75000 ($150,000 joint).
3. Car has to be only one previous owner. (Ask the dealer for the carmax report...it will tell you if it is only 1-owner or not)
4. The model of the used EV must be 2 years or more older than the current model out.
5. Also must be from a dealer, not a personal sale (not 100% sure on this part)...because the dealer has to register with the IRS in order to give you credit for the used EV.   As a matter of fact, when I bought it, the dealer did the paperwork for me, sent it in and gave me the credit in about 2 weeks and released the car to me.  Didn't need to wait to wait for a refund to get it back.

SOunds like a lot, but it's worth saving $4000

Also if you can swing it, you can get some great deals on 2023  Model 3 for right at $25000, with very low mileage and still have warranty on it.  I got a 2023 Model 3 at $21000 after the credit.  Had 25K miles on it and still had a year of warranty left.

I watched for years before snagging my '24 MYLR for $38k after fed rebate back when they had discounts for VINs that sat on the lot too long (*had a small door ding - no paint damage -that Tesla fixed for me with PDR after pickup, that's why it sat around and was discounted in my case).*

You never know when incentives will change.  If you plan on financing a Model Y, the 1.99% APR deal is really amazing and is a huge discount people tend to not realize.  Plus all the extra referral discounts and everything, it's really hard to beat todays price on a Juniper.

But I suppose you are looking at a Model 3, so perhaps there will be another low APR deal on the highland.  Anyway, all I am saying is Tesla will KNOW the discount is going away, and they will advertise the crap out of the fact it no longer will exist, and likely discounts won't be quite as strong in Nov/Dec if I had to guess ...",956,False,1748449480.0,2025-05-28 18:24:40,2,0,abgtw,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kxi4rf/if_the_tax_credits_go_away_when_would_be_the_last/muq31u3/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,muq31u3

For people who want to see the details, subsection 112002(a) of the bill says:

        (a) In General.--Section 30D is amended--
                (1) by redesignating subsection (h) as subsection (i), and
                (2) in subsection (i), as so redesignated, by striking 
            ``December 31, 2032'' and inserting ``December 31, 2026''

This changes [26 USC Section 30D(h)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&edition=prelim&req=granuleid%3AUSC-2010-title26-section30D&num=0) to read:

>~~(h)~~ **(i)** Termination

>No credit shall be allowed under this section with respect to any vehicle placed in service after ~~December 31, 2032~~ **December 31, 2026**.

The next subsection of the bill goes on to say that for vehicles placed in service during 2026, there is a 200,000 vehicle cap. So, for Tesla, the substantive language can effectively be summarized as: ""No credit shall be allowed under this section with respect to any Tesla vehicle placed in service after December 31, 2025.""

We can then read [26 CFR Section 1.30D-2(b)(36)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-26/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-1/subject-group-ECFRcb39f040b41b74b/section-1.30D-2) for what ""placed in service"" means:

comment,1kxrc5b,1kxrc5b,,"It’s a dumb law because it’s so limiting.

Let’s face it: the number of enthusiasts with cars whose model years are between 1976 and 1990, and who want an exemption, is low.

So what’s the goddamn harm in them getting an unlimited-mileage exemption on visual testing and creating an average emissions level for engine size, method of fueling, and aspiration? 

All 1.6-liter (1551cc through 1650cc) engines that are EFI and naturally aspirated have to meet the same standard. All 1.8-liter (1751cc through 1850cc) engines that are EFI and turbocharged have to meet the same standard. Cats are unlimited, but required.

The state has the information from which to build the necessary numbers but doesn’t, because CARB is stupid- necessary and helpful, but stupid.

* Your dad:
   * Intends to buy a used Tesla, 
   * Qualifies for the used EV tax credit,

* You and your brother:

Your question is, ""Will putting your name and your brother's name on the loan and (I presume) any title documents cause any problems with your dad getting the tax credit?"" 

Answer: probably not.  

As far as the IRS is concerned, it seems as though only the person the dealer reports to the IRS as the buyer needs to qualify for the used tax credit.  The IRS doesn't exactly say this, but here are the clues:

In [IRS FS-2024-26, page 4, A11](https://www.irs.gov/pub/taxpros/fs-2024-26.pdf#page=4), the IRS mentioned multiple people getting the *new* EV tax credit:

>The name and taxpayer identification number of the owner claiming the New Clean Vehicle Credit should be listed on the seller’s report. See Topic B, FAQ 9. Accordingly, multiple owners of a new clean vehicle should inform the seller which owner will claim the New Clean Vehicle Credit so that the seller can identify that taxpayer on the seller’s report. **The credit would be allowed only on the tax return of the owner listed in the seller’s report.",3559,True,1748482402.0,2025-05-29 03:33:22,3,0,SirMontego,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kxxgm4/cosign_on_used_ev_credit/mut2xr0/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mut2xr0

And car sales are sliding, yes because of the brand damage.  But as much, if not more so, because there are better, cheaper alternatives.  No more first mover advantage with years of better tech in the pipe.  Just a tired design with old tech.

* Cons: Battery degradation unknown, no home charger (would supercharge every 2 weeks), depreciation, might be overkill if I sell in 2 years or bring it to NYC

# Option 2:  Used Mazda CX-5 (2017+, ~$17-20K)

* Pros: Stylish, reliable, gas is simpler than charging, more peace of mind than Tesla, good resale
* Cons: Still relatively pricey, not EV, higher fuel and maintenance costs than Tesla

# Option 3: 2015 Chevy Cruze (~$4K friend selling for cheap)

* Pros: Cheap, minimal financial risk, but scared of big repair, great for short-term use, low insurance

comment,1ky6ef5,1ky6ef5,,"Continuing our series on California EV sales in the first quarter, we’re now on to overall auto brand rankings. Why spend so much time on California? Well, if it was a country (and the rest of the US was still a country), it would be the 10th largest auto market in the world. Furthermore, it would rank even higher if we were focused on top EV markets. (Though, I don’t have that data on hand — perhaps a story for another day.)

  
Also, being the birthplace of Tesla and being a bastion of progressivism, it’s a fascinating market for examining Tesla sales trends. In fact, if we split the US up into states and combined European countries into one market (I know, now we’re getting weird), California would only trail China (\~135,000) and Europe (\~53,000) in Tesla sales.

Anyway, let’s get on to the trends. As you can see in the chart below, Tesla sales declined by about 7,000 units in the 1st quarter compared to the 1st quarter of 2024. With Honda climbing by about 5,000 sales (and Toyota climbing by about 5,000 sales), that actually meant that Tesla dropped from the second best selling auto brand in the Golden State to the third best selling auto brand in the Golden State.

Used 1st(ish) generation EVs are getting quite affordable. Obviously check the model or brand specific subreddit for common issues, but a used EV is a great value, even with nominal battery degradation. 

As an example, I was shopping for a new commuter car and I wanted an EV. I wanted a small, efficient EV that didn’t look ridiculous. I also didn’t want to spend $25k - $50k for a new car that would depreciate as soon as I signed the paperwork. 

I didn’t need a lot of range, since it’s going back and forth to work and around town. Automated driving was a low priority, because I actually like to drive, though some enhanced safety features are fine. Similarly, have the ability to use DCFC in a pinch was good, but I didn’t need huge max DC speed. 

After looking at leafs, ford focus EVs, miniEVs, and others, I zeroed in on the e-Golf. The 2017-20 versions have DCFC and a “larger” battery that gets over 125mi in EPA and real-life driving in good weather. Some also have heat pumps for HVAC that help mitigate winter losses, though at the cost of a potential failure point.

Seeing as how FSD still isn’t what was promised - both **in name** and from Musk’s description; and how a lot of those cars are quickly approaching end of life…what happens when these owners **finally** realize they’re never getting the full self driving cars they paid for?

Where’s the class action suit?  Will it be enough to finally make a big enough chink in TSLAs armor to send the stock back to where it should have been priced all along?",547,False,1748535640.0,2025-05-29 18:20:40,327,0,Bocifer1,technology,https://reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1kye0vh/tesla_running_socalled_full_selfdriving_software/muwoqp0/,True,,2025,both,hot,False,False,0,muwoqp0
comment,1kyeomc,1kyeomc,,"We leave our max SoC at 60% almost all the time on our Model Y (NMC) and Model 3 (LFP). Our daily drives are \~5%-20%. That leaves the battery SoC between 40-60% most of the time. We also always have one car plugged into a L2 Tesla charger at home.

For the LFP, I charge to 100% about once a month. For the Model Y we bump it to 70% or 80% if we're going out of town.

My understanding is that 50% is the sweet spot for battery longevity. Due to our short commutes, we're able to stay around 50% without inconveniencing ourselves.

It’s worked extremely well for me and it’s nice to get a short walk in the neighborhood. As such I’ve never supercharged except in road trips. It’s also a lot cheaper than supercharging.

For road trips I regularly travel out of state and it works extremely well. I prefer the ABRP app for routes though, as I think the car nav isn’t great for time optimization.

comment,1kyld3i,1kyld3i,,"1. If you have a 2007 Prius only getting 35mpg something is wrong. You should be well over 40mpg.  
  
2. L2 will be more efficient than L1 by a few percentage points.  
  
3. Do not use any stated range numbers for EVs they all tend to be over estimates. Remember, the battery will also degrade significantly over time.   
  
ICE EPA figures are pretty accurate nowadays...EV stuff isn't. However, the 32 miles that our Chrysler and BMW were supposed to get was pretty accurate.   
  
4. We've had hybrids (Prius 2005), PHEVs (Chrysler Pacifica and BMW x5), and an EV (Y AWD LR) - For long trips the PHEV is the way to go. Even with Tesla charging stations you're going to add signficant time to your trip and there's no guarantee that the charging station is going to have services nearby...and if they do whether they'll be open.

Of the PHEVs we've driven the Hyunda Santa Fe was pretty nice. The Mazdas were a little rough...especially when the battery was run out. I think they need a bit more time to get them right. The Toyota Rav 4 and Lexus were both really nice. The Lexus TX was the nicest of all...including our BMW x5 45e.

Why do we own a Y...well, we needed a car and at the end of '24 Tesla was offering discounts, rebates, 0% financing, etc. that brought the effective  cost of the car down to around $30k. At that price there really wasn't anything that competes.

comment,1kyld3i,1kyld3i,,"> As a side note, even though we don't want to deal with range anxiety, we notice regular EVs tend to have a far better efficiency rating in this sense. A Tesla Y is 27kWh/100 miles, meaning (at this special PG&E rate plan) our total cost for home charging would be 8.4 cents per mile.

This is not surprising given the specific vehicles you compared. You're looking at larger PHEVs which also are using inefficient parallel hybrid setup (as opposed to much more efficient power-split of Prius/Rav4 which I don't believe has been put in any larger PHEVs yet). And comparing them to Model Y which is smaller and made by a company that really worked hard to get their efficiency/range numbers up (through aerodynamics, an advanced hvac system, and some goofery with EPA test cycles)",780,False,1748554058.0,2025-05-29 23:27:38,2,0,iamtherussianspy,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kyld3i/new_vehicle_purchase_check_my_gaskwh_math_please/muyhn8u/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,muyhn8u

I had the cash so paying 120k for the truck was not a big deal because I was okay with it and wanted it. I didn’t buy it for a future value I bought it because I liked it.

I will say I drive it daily and you are likely to run into haters still so if that is any indication they are doing their best to drive down the price. You can guess it will come down but again it doesn’t really change the fact that if you are okay with 70k for it then it doesn’t matter what it comes down to.

It felt like FSD was likely to get close in the next 12 months, but was considered almost without value in a used car, making it effectively free. 12 came out a couple months later and I felt validated LOL.

I work in auto and knew Tesla would either have to upgrade cars with insufficient hardware, repay the value, or make very attractive transfers to newer cars.

Once FSD unsupervised comes online, cost will skyrocket on both subscriptions and outright purchase.

Since buying, it's become clear that A) HW3 won't get there, and B) HW4 probably won't either. A transfer to AI5 is the move.

comment,1kypy47,1kypy47,,"Nonsense

Faraday didn't have a decent formal mathematical education and yet Maxwell, one of the greatest physicists to ever live and a killer mathematician, publicly proclaimed that Faraday was a mathematician of the highest order.

Degrees matter and obviously some fields require certification, like medicine. You can't be legally considered an MD and can't call yourself one unless you're formally registered as one.

I'd argue though that conversely for philosophers and mathematicians, even today, it's almost completely irrelevant whether they are formally academically trained.

Srinivasa Ramanujan did not have a mathematical degree when he was discovered but saying he therefore wasn't a mathematician would prompt me to ask you to wash your mouth with soap.

For actual philosophers it's even worse and I'm willing to argue academic philosophy is a terrible way to make sure you'll never be an original relevant thinker. Pretty much like art school is definitely not the best way to become a great painter.

Engineers are halfway between doctors and philosophers because they build shit that must not break down while people walk on it or explode while people are flying it. 

Obviously legally designs that may collapse or explode would therefore probably require oversight by formally graduated engineers. Insurers won't like it otherwise (though maybe you can go without the title as long as the certifying party is formally graduated?).",2039,True,1748607418.0,2025-05-30 14:16:58,1,0,QuinQuix,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/1kypy47/nvidia_ceo_jensen_huang_we_do_a_lot_of_business/mv1zvvz/,True,,2025,elon,hot,False,False,0,mv1zvvz

It's not about what you're mentally capable of, it's about what you're legally capable of.

Engineering (and medicine) is in this case other than mathematics or philosophy, because it has safety risks. You have to have the documented capabilities. In your view Andrew Tate is a philosopher cause he has a philosophical opinion.

comment,1kz4q5u,1kz4q5u,,"I swear 98% of the people who rag on tesla about FSD have never even ridden in the car and experienced it for themselves. 

Is it perfect? No.

Is it ready for me to take a nap while it drives me? No. 

Does it do it's job damn near flawlessly 97% of the time? Absolutely.

It really is incredible tech and no other car manufacturer has even come close. Tesla haters want to believe the other makers are 'already surpassing' Tesla's tech, but they're delusional, Everybody else is years behind. 

Are there other EV's with nicer interiors? More comfortable rides? More creature comforts? Sure.

comment,1kywek3,1kywek3,,"I would not buy a short range model. The longer range also means an effectively longer lifespan and greater utility through different climates. 

I also wouldn't recommend an EV unless you can regularly charge at home overnight. I never need to touch the chargers in my city. Supercharging is also not much cheaper than gasoline. 

You should also get some insurance quotes. Tesla vehicles tend to cost more to insure in many places.

Waiting is almost always the better choice with cars since you'll be able to get something better for less money down the line. Especially with EVs where you can see some significant  improvements with newer models.",650,False,1748619426.0,2025-05-30 17:37:06,1,0,iJeff,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kywek3/buy_now_or_wait/mv32nrj/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mv32nrj
