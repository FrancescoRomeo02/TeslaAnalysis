As this link references, in her biography *Tesla: Man Out of Time*, Margaret Cheney claimed Tesla was antisemitic saying he made an antisemitic comment to a secretary once. There doesn't appear to be any corroborating evidence of Tesla having any prejudice against Jewish people though with the small exception of Tesla making the offhand remark about Jewish people being part of a bad day in a context that suggests humor, irony or potentially even referencing someone else's joke obliquely. Tesla's secretary, George Scherff once made a very mild antisemitic joke in a telegram to Tesla apparently referencing Jewish lawyers being associated with charging high prices in relating Tesla's new Jewish lawyer required a prepaid retainer.

Unlike many American businessmen of the 1930s, Tesla never said anything positive about Hitler.

I don't know if it was the norm, but it was at least so much more common that it wasn't considered unusual. My point is that, Cheney's unsubstantiated doubtful claim aside, Tesla's lack of antisemitism was more significant than it would be today. He was born in the Austrian empire in 1856, which for historical context was 5 years before the US Civil War started, and despite his setting, he wasn't concerned about a Jewish financial conspiracy or stealing scientific accolades (Lenard's accusation) or whatever concerned racists.",569,False,1491074082.0,2017-04-01 21:14:42,3,0,dalkon,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/62o47n/was_tesla_antisemitic_a_look_at_his_humanitarian/dfpa0uq/,True,,2017,tesla,hot,False,False,0,dfpa0uq

The generator/dynamo symbols refer to his 1890 RF alternators capable of producing VLF (up to ~30 kHz) at up to 25 KW with cooling ([447,920](http://www.google.com/patents/US447920), [447,921](https://www.google.com/patents/US447921)). Besides those alternators he patented, he mentioned building more experimental ones for higher frequencies but only at much low power.

comment,65at46,65at46,,">This revolving globe generates every moment enough electricity, if it could be stored in batteries, to run all the machinery of the world for the balance of time. At the North Pole this electricity streams off in beautiful red ribbons called the auroras, and we see this phenomenon on account of the highly attenuated condition of the atmosphere. But everywhere, as high as the air reaches, around this earth is this immense wealth of nature, yet man, in his blindness and puniness, continues to manufacture with his little dynamos what nature has placed before him in such abundance. He does not need to manufacture another spark; he needs only to use an infinitesimal fraction of what is already made and the world of intelligence will become a whispering-gallery, and the world of machinery will move in its appointed motion out of forces of the invisible air.

Nernst and colleagues would later develop Tesla's idea that earth's atmosphere contains a lot of energy. Ewald Rasch's [*Electric Arc Phenomena*](https://books.google.com/books?id=Lp8gAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA186&lpg=PA186) (1911) cites a Chwolson who calculated the earth-ionosphere contains 1.3e5 coulombs at 1e9 volts [1 GV] for EJt ≅ 24.7×10²⁴ W⋅s.

comment,6erjqi,6erjqi,,"No, I don't. And quite frankly, I'm getting pretty tired of hearing that narrative.

First of all, let me say that I am pretty happy with my personal life. Me and my wife frequently go to the movies, hike the mountains, hang at the beach, visit museums and whatnot. I love to cook, play videogames, work out regularly, have many friends and occasionally get to drink copious amounts of beer. So although working at SpaceX can get rough from time to time, it's hardly fair to say that my life outside work sucks.

Nevertheless, working at SpaceX (and supposedly the same can be said for Tesla) can be extremely hard, challenging and stressful. Expectations are high, days are often long and I probably could get paid more elsewhere. So yeah, sure; I think it's fair to say that my job has affected my personal life quite a bit, and many of the horror stories you've heard are probably true, at least to some extent. But I truly detest the idea that Elon is some sort of slave-master, exploiting young souls under dangerous and unhealthy working conditions at sub-par wages, all so he can line his pockets with profits. That is just pure bullshit.

Naturally, working at SpaceX will not be for everyone. And I don't mean that in an arrogant way, as in ""hurrdurr some people are not smart/tough/awesome enough to work here""; I mean that different people value things differently.

comment,78godk,78godk,,"John G. Trump was an EE professor. Here's his [doctoral thesis on vacuum electrostatics](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/32556) from 1933.

In this report from 1943, he dismissed the military value of Tesla's notes that had been withheld from being released to his family by a wartime government agency, the Office of Alien Property. Part of his reason for this was because, as the report noted at several points, Tesla had already disclosed important ideas to people in relevant industries, military scientists (like his assistant Bloyce Fitzgerald) and physicists like presumably especially Arthur Compton and Alfred Parson. In a 1933 interview, Tesla said he barely slept, so despite people around him saying he was as sharp as ever, you wouldn't expect him to have been doing his best work by that point in his life. His mechanical vibration ideas were probably motivated by having sold all of his electromagnetic wireless power intellectual property to Morgan to fund half of the expense of building Wardenclyffe.

The FBI claims they didn't know what was in the safe or the trunks because the Office of Alien Property collected all the material. In an earlier letter, the FBI says Tesla's nephew was the first to open the safe. The Office of Alien Property just acted on their own, without contacting the FBI, the national security agency at the time? The big glaring fact being squirmed around is why was Office of Alien Property contacted, when Nikola Tesla was a Naturalized US Citizen?

comment,7e2ze2,7e2ze2,,"Bugatti hasn’t even attempted top speed in their car yet. The 261 is just what they limit the car to right now for their customers.

Everyone knows it will be 280mph+, the question is can they find new tires that let them reach 300.

If you read Motor Trend’s review of the Chiron, they said a $180k Turbo S would accelerate as fast in 0-60, but the Chiron feels to accelerate faster from 60-180mph than it does 0-60, that’s where most of the power delivery is.

It’s odd that Tesla only bragged about 0-60 and 0-100mph numbers, for most hyper cars that aim for 250mph+ top speed, they brag about 0-124, 60-150, or 0-200mph time, that’s where the differences lie. 

Actually they mostly brag about lap times around the Nurburgring, since that’s a better indicator of the overall performance of a vehicle.  

One big concern with EV in this context is that due to the nature of EV, a powerful car would require a big battery pack, and current battery technology means it will be a very heavy battery pack. Weight is public enemy number one as far as motor sport engineering is concerned, so the Roadster's track performance is still a big question mark at this point.

comment,7fgglh,7fgglh,,"renewables are cheaper.  To the point that you have to mine an order of magnitude more ore to get enough uranium to produce as much energy as a silicon solar cell- and that is without even considering recycling the solar cells.  Even factoring the cost of batteries in, nuclear just can't compete.  Math:

I'm gonna do the math for one square meter of solar paneling.  That's [186 W of solar cells](http://sinovoltaics.com/learning-center/quality/standard-test-conditions-stc-definition-and-problems/), about [$192 installed](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/68925.pdf), including land cost, taxes, etc etc etc.  A residential system will cost about 3x as much.  Over most of the US, that panel will generate an average of 1 kWh per day (5.5 kWh insolation times 18.6% efficiency).  To a rough approximation you'll need to store about 30% of that power overnight- 300 Wh.  Lets call that $120/kWh for the batteries- that's a reasonable large-scale current cost.  Say it lasts 5000 cycles, same as the Tesla powerwall- 13.7 years.  In reality that could last way, way longer at a slightly higher capacity, but say you just replace it until the panels run out.  That's $192 for the panels and $108 for the batteries, warrantied for at least 41 years.  

That gives you a cost of 2.0 cents per kWh.  Compare to nuclear, where still-unfinished plants are supposed to come in at [9.6 cents per kWh](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf).",1911,True,1511659023.0,2017-11-26 02:17:03,4,0,hwillis,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7fgglh/bernie_sanders_posted_about_teslas_powerpack/dqca7pw/,True,,2017,tesla,top,False,False,0,dqca7pw

comment,7frfq1,7frfq1,,"[My Inventions](http://www.tfcbooks.com/special/my_inventions_index.htm) is his 1919 autobiography serialized in one of Gernsback's electronics magazines. It's very short. 

*[Prodigal Genius: The Life of Nikola Tesla](http://books.google.com/books?id=40NzjS5FunkC&pg=PP8)* (1944) was written by a science journalist who personally knew Tesla and praised him highly. 

*[Wizard: The Life And Times Of Nikola Tesla](http://books.google.com/books?id=DzMR8x_rbPgC&pg=PT6)* (1996) is longer and more detailed. It's probably the best Tesla bio.

If you dislike Tesla, you might like Margaret Cheney's *Tesla: Man Out of Time* (1981) or Bernard Carlson's *Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age* (2013). They don't like him and don't understand anything technical, so they misunderstand and misrepresent a lot. ^* In writing her book, Cheney consulted with people who understood various aspects of Tesla's ideas like Leland Anderson, so it's a blend of understanding and confusion. It credits Tesla for certain things inaccurately, but fails to credit him for most of what he did. Carlson previously wrote a biography of Elihu Thomson, and his Tesla bio basically calls Tesla a second-rate Elihu Thomson.

It's not what you asked about, but if someone were looking for more technical information, they might like Leland Anderson's technical compilations from [tfcbooks.com](http://tfcbooks.com/mall/books.",1845,True,1511789930.0,2017-11-27 14:38:50,4,0,dalkon,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/7frfq1/whats_the_best_tesla_biography/dqejzum/,True,,2017,tesla,hot,False,False,0,dqejzum

Tesla still need to deliver on their promises but until then, this is still in the *potential* category of game-changers. 

I don’t wanna sound like a nay-sayer because I’m far from that, but i also don’t want to fall in the trap of being a blind fan. 

Edit: 

There's been a few replies to this comment and another comment about my ""cautiously optimistic"" statement. I'll try to reply to those comments as well but I wanted to add an edit here to get ahead of the ""you're wrong"" replies. 

My comment here is not meant to say that Tesla will not fulfill their promise, nor am I trying to argue that Tesla is not currently in a good situation. I'm just addressing the comment that the Semi will put Tesla in a good situation. I believe the Semi **can** put Tesla in a good situation but as of right now, it can't do much other than fuel the hype. There are no Tesla's on the road transporting goods, or even Tesla semis in production, it's simply a POC right now and trying to shake up the industry. 

So again, I'll reiterate what my comment was originally trying to say. The Semi *can* be a big deal, the Semi *can* become a game-changer, the Semi *can* put Tesla in a good situation, but as of December 19 2017, the Tesla Semi is simply just another proof of concept similar to the [Nikola Corp](https://nikolamotor.com/one) electric semi.",1402,False,1513693981.0,2017-12-19 15:33:01,614,0,Ragnar_Targaryen,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7ktg18/ups_preorders_125_tesla_electric_trucks/drh09ma/,True,,2017,tesla,top,False,False,0,drh09ma

He offered to travel to the countries and would build the defense system in their country. He was in negotiations with Neville Chamberlain until Chamberlain suddenly cut off all correspondence with him. After that Tesla got an offer from Russia and did travel there, doing something. This series is saying Tesla had a network of laboratories across Europe and they are going to be excavating them.

comment,81xi87,81xi87,,"Your comment had me wondering, how expensive is it really? Obviously the Tesla's are luxury priced, but then again isn't Europe the place where people get taxi'ed in Mercedes? Can the alledged lower running costs of a Tesla Model S make up the cost difference? I dug around and found this

According to [this source](https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/Netherlands/diesel_prices/), the average diesel price in the Netherlands for the past few months has been 1,27 euros per liter, that's $5.9/gallon. Gasoline is even worse, 1.55 euros per liter or $7.22/gallon, but for the sake of the argument let's go with diesel.

According to [this source](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/8/8c/Electricity_prices%2C_first_half_of_year%2C_2015-2017.png), the average **household** price of a kWh of energy in the Netherlands in the 1st semester of last year was 0.156 euros per kWh, non-household is considerably lower, but let's go with worst case scenario.

The first Model S seen in the picture has a 85 kWh battery, according [to this source](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=32557) to be good enough for 265 miles, or 426 km. But let's go with 400 km to round it down, that's 4.7 km per kWh

Now let's find a comparable car to match the Tesla against.

This is interesting considering, in 2018, over 3,000 exoplanets have now been found, several imaged directly. These have been mostly gas giants but the era of finding thousands of small, rocky inner exoplanets is only just starting.  
  
Tesla did go into showman mode during these interviews, so his terminology needs to be understood. He was talking about detecting signals from more than 20 planets, meaning exoplanets. He never claimed to have had two-way communication, he only detected what he thought were communications between these exoplanets. It could be that he was detecting pulsars and not knowing what they were, thought they were communications between star systems.    
  
These are a few areas out of his Colorado Spring testing results that don't get covered because they have been too fringe, until now. He was talking about frequencies up to 10^24 cycles per second. Gamma ray telescopes, which had a Top Secret reason in the 1970's for happening, are now used to monitor stellar events, 10^19 cycles per second.

Jupiter and Mars were close enough in the sky at the time that he mistook one for the other. Unlike Tesla, now we know how that signal is produced and that it is a natural phenomenon that Jupiter and also Saturn can produce that does not indicate an intelligent source.

The additional context raises interesting questions. Was Tesla building ever more powerful radio transmitters in an attempt to communicate with his misinterpreted sign of intelligence? It seems like that may have been the case. His pre-1910 quenched gap radio transmitters were so powerful that quenched gap radio transmitters were banned entirely as one of the first radio regulations. One of Tesla's solutions to the problem of the extreme spectrum limitation imposed by everyone using global-strength radio transmitters was to use complex automatically varied modulation with multiple signals on multiple antennas.

Unfortunately much less is known about those later inventions though, so it would be difficult.

Because a movie about his later period is still waiting for someone to write a book about it let alone a screenplay, a book or movie about the group of inventors affiliated with him who were known as ""the Philadelphia crowd"" might be interesting: Harry Shoemaker, Gustav Gehring, Cornelius Ehret, et al.

One inventor affiliated with Tesla already did have a series of successful children's fiction based on him, although not many people know that he was in fact affiliated with Tesla. John Hays Hammond, Jr. was supposed to have inspired Jonny Quest, the 1960s children's animation.

comment,8nsawv,8nsawv,,"The way this script is written, its a bio-pic drama that does touch base on wireless transmission, radio, oscillator technology, remote control, etc. It doesn't focus on the war of the currents as much as most documentaries and fan films have. Although the time period does take place in that period as those were instrumental in the development of his career, this film will focus on many factual events that most neglect to focus on.

In regards to his later years that you mentioned; yes, that would be one amazing aspect to work on, however then it would steer more towards sci-fiction as we simply do not have access to documentation proving what most of us believe to have taken place. The purpose of this movie is to educated while entertaining, and we've found a way around the dry and boring aspects to keep our audience engaged.

comment,8nsawv,8nsawv,,"The History Channel has a new Tesla series focused on trying to find the Lost Trunks. Tesla had laboratories all over New York, which he was eventually kicked out of for not paying the rent. In the 1930's, he ended up at the Hotel New Yorker where he also had laboratories on a few floors.  
  
Since Tesla was robbed from continuously after Wardenclyffe, he became much more secretive about what he was working on. In a later interview, he mentioned he had 80 large steamer trunks with his research papers. After his death, 50 were found and turned over to the Belgrade museum. That left the question of where the lost trunks went and what was in them. That is what the new series is focused on. They are finding out many things about the New Yorker. It is the same height as the Wardenclyffe tower and had mysterious changes made to its architecture not long before Tesla moved in.

Yes, because the physics of it are fundamentally and unchangeably inefficient.  Power deceases by the square of the distance.  Not to mention that pumping that much electrical energy into the air would turn practically every exposed peice of metal into a live wire.

Intel can't fix that, either.  What they're trying to do is direct beams towards whatever it is they're trying to power, instead of transmitting in all directions.

It has taken over 100 years to find out Wardenclyffe wasn't a Tesla coil, and was not for transmitting power through air. The power was coming out of the air and being transmitted deep underground. It would be similar to burying a Tesla coil upside down into the ground. The legs on the Wardenclyffe tower had solid copper bars in them that were imbedded in giant granite blocks at the base. Granite is an excellent insulator.  

The ""death ray"", which Tesla hated, and called a charged particle beam weapon also has nothing to do with a Tesla coil other than being for the individual microwave beam barrels. A Tesla turbine was being used to produce gigantic electrostatic voltages.

comment,96unzt,96unzt,,"Ionized gas bombarding the glass is gone. It's ionized, so it's chemically reactive, so it should probably react with the glass. It's bombarded too deep in the glass to be accessible even if it did not also react. The ionized gas might even be able to be bombarded through the glass to the exterior of the bulb. Ionized dust fireballs can be passed through glass, and gas molecules are much smaller. If the bulb absorbs a lot of ions or electrons at a point, it can be heated and pressurized sufficiently to form a tiny bubble of molten glass that bulges from the surface. Tesla described this phenomenon at some point.

The most important step to minimize bombardment hardening to maintain a static vacuum pressure is to use smoother more sinusoidal waves. Tesla developed his 11 kHz 2 KW alternator in 1891 for smoother and better tuned waves than the spark gap oscillators he started with. Apparently preferred a quenched spark gap for maximum efficiency despite noise, but in subsequent decades leading radio engineers developed more powerful higher frequency alternators for early AM radio.

In this patent, Moore uses what he called a very high frequency alternator, but he might only mean as little as around 1-2 kHz by that.

comment,9hmh08,9hmh08,,"This is a pretty simple little concept and sub-component wave responsive device like a coherer. It's an electrometer with hinged plates that move with low inertia. Tesla used it as an electrostatic sensor-switch. Shoemaker used it as a sensor to convert surface waves signals to audio signals. In the terms of the day, this wave responsive device would be called *self-restoring* because unlike a coherer, it doesn't need a decoherer to kick it off again after being switched on.

In later patents, Shoemaker continued to develop this concept into a selective frequency responsive electromagnetically adjustable vibrating switch.

Perhaps more notably, Shoemaker was one of a number of inventors who was also using the ground surface wave model Tesla used, which probably does more to suggest Tesla was working with Shoemaker in some capacity. Shoemaker's patent describes ground surface waves like this, ""The nature of the energy transmitted is principally electrostatic, though there may be some slight component of electromagnetic.""

comment,9m97q7,9m97q7,,"Hmm? Are you exhausting from around the axis of the rotor or from the other input port? The unused input port is only for reversing rotation. Whichever port is unused should be closed instead of being an output port. The air flow of a Tesla turbine is centripetal to the center of the disks, so this looks almost identical to a Tesla turbine, but it's operating very differently. 

One of the neat things about the centripetal flow design is that efficiency increases with rotor speed because the increasing centrifugal force increases resistance to the centripetal flow.

Spherical aerials don't make sense from a conventional Hertz wave standpoint. This is because they are designed for ground surface wave signaling rather than radiating Hertz waves. For Hertz wave wireless, they don't make as much sense as the more common wire antennas that most other inventors used. With ground surface wave signaling, the aerial isn't an antenna. Instead it is a capacitive waveguide probe that launches surface waves that are bound to the surface(s) of the waveguide. 

Tesla had a complicated relationship with Reginald Fessenden. Like Marconi, Fessenden worked for Edison. And apparently also like Marconi, Fessenden was taking ideas from Tesla without permission. Fessenden once played a sneaky trick on Tesla. He sent a lawyer to Tesla to offer to represent Tesla in a lawsuit that Tesla was not yet even aware had been filed against him (by a third party over an invention), but that lawyer was secretly collecting information from Tesla in order to represent Fessenden to try to claim credit for certain inventions from Tesla. This information only became available from some of Tesla's telegrams that were not released until the past decade.

post,9p819m,,Tesla Model X 1000 mile road-trip report,"I thought I’d write a review of a Tesla Model X for the sub from the perspective of a V8 loving petrolhead. There’s a lot of hate on here, and even more misinformation, so I thought I’d give the car a chance. 

I’ve just spent 5 days with a 75D and done over 1000 miles. The car was a 2016 with Gen 1 Autonomous tech, 68,000 miles on the clock, and a 200 mile range battery. 

My last big drive was in a 3.0D Range Rover Velar, and the road-trip car before that was a Merc C63 AMG V8 Bi-turbo. I’ve owned 15+ cars, many over 400bhp, and driven dozens more in Europe, UAE and the US. 

The car was booked through Turo. This was for a road-trip from Vegas to San Diego and back, so some days I was doing around 350 miles. Other days I started in the city center of SD and then drove to attractions in and outside the city. I covered all kinds of roads, but the vast majority were freeway and city driving. 

Originally I’d booked a BMW i8 to do the trip, but the car was apparently totaled two days before my booking, so the Model X was a last-minute alternative. I’m aware of how unreliable Turo bookings can be, so I had my eyes on a Tesla as a replacement in case of issues. 

---

**First the bad.** 

This car has a massive blind spot. Within 10 minutes of being in the car I was blasted with horn as I nearly wiped out some poor fucker in a SUV. It seems this blind spot exists when in Autopilot too, as it sometimes happened when the car was autonomously changing lanes.

comment,9o8iku,9o8iku,,"That's a good point. Tesla was using megavolts when everyone else was using kilovolts, which was a very important reason for the shape of the terminal. In [US645576](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/645576.pdf), his first patent with spherical terminals from 1897, he mentioned producing potentials of 2-4 megavolts. In 1899, I believe he mentioned reaching around 15 MV at Colorado Springs. And by the 1920s, he was talking about using 100 MV for power transmission. If he used a pointier terminal that leaked ions, it would take a lot more power to attain those voltages if it would be possible at all. 

He first depicted a segmented aerial terminal like those in your link in [US1119732](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/1119732.pdf), his 1907 magnifying transmitter patent. It's interesting the central spark/arc breakout point on the aerial terminal in that patent is egg-shaped. It almost seems like a throwback to his [Egg of Columbus](https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/articles/teslas-egg-columbus) from when he was first developing induction motors. It seems like it might also have been a reference to the intended mode of operation for the tower system, which is to launch alternately rotating electrostatic-magnetic waves. I assume he intended to use what we call magnetosonic waves today, but he might have used any other sort of plasma wave. I don't know enough about plasma and its waves to have an opinion.

Tesla board member, Steve Jurvetson called it ""the most extraordinary act of entrepreneurial zeal and commitment I've ever seen.""

&#x200B;

The financing round was falling apart because the entire global economy appeared to be on brink of collapse, and investors were extremely skittish about investing in a car startup that was on the verge of bankruptcy. At the last hour, Elon essentially said, ""screw it, I'll personally finance the entire round."" Elon was willing to go net negative on his net worth to save Tesla. This changed the mood in the room and the round closed.

comment,ad2w07,ad2w07,,"It is just a plain, simple fact that this planet, Earth, has a gigantic electrostatic field, that increases to thousands and thousands of volts, the higher the altitude. The problem with street-level popular history is that it has to take significant discovery events and trivialize them, making them more prurient for layman consumption. This is what happened with Benjamin Franklin and his kite in a lightning storm, using a silk string as the electrostatic conductor. It wasn't the fact there was lightning that was significant. It was that Franklin discovered he could acquire thousands of volts with his kite, and that would conduct to the key he had as the collector. What history didn't note is that was in 1752. The Leyden jar was invented in 1745. Franklin found he could charge banks of Leydon jars (capacitors) with his simple kite and key collector. Franklin goes to France in 1774, to lobby for French support against the British, and promptly forgets what he is doing, spending most of his time with French royalty and their almost daily partying, and orgies. One of the novelties he introduced was getting a shock from a Leyden jar as a therapeutic and titillating jolt.  
  
The factors to note, one, is the Leyden jar is a capacitor with a solid dielectric.

comment,ad2w07,ad2w07,,"Yeah, there are a lot of popular misconceptions about what Franklin did. His kite was not struck by lightning like many people think. He would have been injured and probably would not have survived if it had been struck. And while he was primarily trying to prove that lightning was a manifestation of static electric, as you say, his more momentous feat may have been in discovering the high strength of atmospheric electrostatic charge.

The power of atmospheric electric was brought to the fore again by European scientists in the 1920s. Looking for megavolts for nuclear research they turned to suspending large nets high in the air to collect potentials as high as 5-30 megavolts. https://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Electrical-Experimenter/SI-1928-06.pdf  
https://archive.org/details/SI192806

Telluric currents in Earth are incredibly large but the potential is very low. If we reinforce and strengthen Martian telluric currents, maybe we could cause Mars to accumulate an atmosphere. Or closer to home, if we disturb Earth's telluric currents sufficiently, maybe we could dangerously impair the conditions that make life possible on earth including retaining our atmosphere.

I think it's too bad that you are not getting the support you want. However, I think the answer to why this is happening is hidden in this reply right here. It may well be that Tesla (or their advisers) have come to the conclusion that if they start creating solutions for the Turkish market, the will have ""entered that market"", and therefore be obliged to provide additional support to Turkish Tesla owners, follow specific Turkish regulations etc. 

In other words, fixing a small issue in relation to Turkey might bring other consequences with it for the company. Not saying I agree with that stance, and of course I think it'd be really good if Tesla entered all markets to help move everyone to a sustainable mode of transport, but it may be the explanation.

Wardenclyffe had a coal-fired power plant with boiler, steam turbine and generators. Most of it was from Westinghouse. Tesla apparently considered it a payment or gift, but Westinghouse eventually repossessed it years later saying he had never paid.

Tesla apparently intended to use two different wireless transmission methods simultaneously. One was a ground component, and the other was a sky component. It's possible one component automatically produced the other. It's not clear.

comment,avz9z9,avz9z9,,"Thomas Henry Moray invented nuclear reactor vacuum tubes powered by tiny x-ray tubes embedded within an outer tube that combined the functions of a tiny nuclear reactor and vacuum capacitor.

Moray's new nuclear technology has confused a lot of people over the years because for a long time he used an antenna to generate power by amplifying an ambient noise signal. That lead many to believe that he must be receiving a large amount of radio power somehow. The way that he talked about receiving energy in his book contributed to that misunderstanding.

Instead of receiving a huge amount of radio energy, which is impossible, his device worked by converting mass to particle energy in some nuclear reaction and then converting particle energy into electric charge. The radio noise input might not be anything besides a convenient arbitrary AC signal to amplify. The way that Moray said that it received external power appears to have been related to Tesla's theory that radioactivity is caused by some external radiation disturbing the mass energy in radioactive matter. (edit: And it really only obfuscates the simple way that we can understand how the device worked.)

Moray's patent on his technology shows tube designs that Tesla first displayed in his 1897 lecture about vacuum tubes. The timing of this patent is kind of interesting too.

This planet Earth is a tiny grain of sand with a melted flake of iron at its center, with a pinhead of a molten uranium-platinum-gold at the center, the Core.

People were stealing from Tesla his whole life, as much as they could get away with, and why he had to get a vault to know where his latest work was and secret ways to leave and return to the hotel.  
  
The problem with fixating on the Wardenclyffe time is to ignore the rest of what was happening from there, into World War II. The Whitewashing Revisionism backed by the Edison Institute to wipe Tesla from US history would have the sap/suckers believe he died forgotten and alone, a decrepit old man, in a dank hotel room, considered mostly a babbling mad man that had once been a decent electrician.  
  
Tesla was keeping up with tubes and he invented most aspects of electric potential in vacuum tubes. He is looking at his button lamp in eternal awe, in the 1880's.

The Pierce-Arrow car story is believable considering many other forms of new nuclear power Tesla invented and other revolutionary energy technology, but I've never seen anything corroborating it and have seen some things casting doubt on other aspects of the story at least as it is usually told.

Moray doesn't appear to have stolen anything from Tesla. Tesla shared it with him. And Moray was hardly the only one. Tesla gave revolutionary energy technology away to many inventors over his lifetime.

I have come to suspect the ambient energy harvesting systems including atmospheric energy could be more dangerous than the nuclear ones, and the nuclear ones like Moray's are also very dangerous except for those using only clean aneutronic reactions like boron fusion-fission, which is a more recent invention.",1141,False,1551663409.0,2019-03-04 02:36:49,1,0,dalkon,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/avz9z9/clip_from_t_henry_moray_documentary_the_sea_of/ehqlbh2/,True,,2019,tesla,hot,False,False,0,ehqlbh2

Westinghouse's personal inventions were mostly related to train safety to prevent the deadliest form of traffic accidents of his time and eliminate the need for a dangerous job they said killed 5,000 men in a bad year—and when that was a much larger proportion of the population than it is now.

Westinghouse only owned Westinghouse Electric for 21 years after starting it in 1886. In 1907, when the powerful bankers squeezed the credit markets in another panic, his large debts for global expansion cost him the company. GE and Westinghouse have presumably been owned by the same people since then. Edison lost the War of the Currents after 1893, but Morgan still won control of Westinghouse's company 14 years later.

Westinghouse also invented a corporation but it was a more benevolent corporation, where the workers were more like a family, growing the corporation while the corporation took care of the workers and their families. It never caught on and died out with the passing of Westinghouse.    
  
Anyway, it is too late. What's done is done. We are all living in the Henry Ford - internal combustion engine, Thomas Edison - metered electric utilities and mercenary corporations, J.P. Morgan - utility and corporate vulture banking, and  Albert Einstein - matter before energy. In this timeline, the CO2 and CH4 emissions from ICE (internal combustion engines) for all transportation and farming, and corporate scale farming and cattle ranch clearing of forests, is starting to increase geometrically. The Point Of No Return (PONR) is around 2040, when Zero Emissions must be achieved. This isn't going to happen.

For absolutely sure. For the record, steering out of the way like that should not be a human's gut reaction because if you steer into oncoming traffic (particularly a highway) it could lead to a significantly worse crash, and on top of that you would be 100% liable for any crash/damage that occurred as a result of that maneuver. If the autopilot was able to reliably determine there was no oncoming car and steer out of the way to avoid the front end collision, that is a really good outcome!

comment,c0bt9b,c0bt9b,,"This is the other Tesla coil and coil winding method that time seems to have forgotten about because it was overshadowed by the iconic high voltage Tesla coil. This is essentially the idea of using the distributed capacitance of a coil and especially using distributed capacitance to move current through a coil without normal impedance. Neutralizing impedance increases quality factor, increases the peak magnetic field strength of current, and can be used to widely broaden the bandwidth of resonance (at least with two conductors or with more conductors or sections the resonant bandwidth can be sharper for better filtering). 

The leftmost inventions show preceding ideas where two coils in proximity are wound oppositely. That is kind of similar but it's not the same idea. And before Elihu Thomson patented that as a lightning transient filter, Charles J. Van Depoele patented that slightly different winding for use on a motor in the 1880s. 

Richard Varley patented the idea in Canada for an induction coil in 1892, the year before Tesla patented it in the US, but Tesla once said ""the Varley coil"" was his idea. In fact if I'm remembering correctly, Tesla said Roentgen was using an induction coil he got from Varley when Roentgen discovered x-rays. 

""The Varley coil"" as it's described later is an x-ray transformer a little different from the 1892 patent.

post,c0i66t,,Reading between the lines: What Slack didn’t disclose in its IPO filing," Slack Technologies, the developer of the popular namesake team collaboration messaging app, recently [applied](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019004786/slacks-1.htm#sA031AD7407DEE4C9AD8C567D8A577EE8) for a public offering on the stock market. This is not a classic IPO, but a “direct listing,” also known a “direct public offering.” This means Slack is not raising money by directly selling shares and instead allows early investors and employees to sell their shares in the public offering. Music streaming service Spotify held a successful direct listing last year.

This story caught my attention for a simple reason. In August 2016, I joined the team developing a still-undercover product called Workplace by Facebook—a direct competitor to Slack. I worked on the product for 2.5 years. Back then, I dreamed of having an opportunity to look inside Slack’s business metrics.

It may seem that Slack has revealed a lot of data about the business in their [S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019004786/slacks-1.htm#sA031AD7407DEE4C9AD8C567D8A577EE8), a document that is almost 200 pages in length.

The reality is, they haven’t. The company had already disclosed in various ways much of the information compiled in their report.

But if we combine the data disclosed in S-1 filing and the experience I gained while working on Slack’s competitor, we’ll be able to uncover interesting details that will paint a more holistic picture.

I must say that this article contains my personal thoughts on the matter, jotted down while going through their S-1 filing, and should not be considered as investment advice.

comment,c4wu67,c4wu67,,"So I never saw the car until he speed past me.  He tried to use the merge lane to pass on the right.  After the accident I didn't go near his car and stayed with the guy who took the initial hit (he was shaken up).  

When the cops arrived I just told the cop(s) that I had a video when he needed it and was let go (the cops didn't want us to stay for fear of another accident).  When the police called me I had this clip ready (I only noticed the White Model 3 getting hit when I pulled the video).  Cop told me the Durango driver claimed he was swerving to avoid a speeding car behind him when the accident occurred and none of the other drivers knew what happened. Luckily I was able to prove he was a liar and I am a formal witness to the accident with my footage attached to the report.  

The Cop did ask how I was able to provide all the footage so I told him its standard on Teslas.

Update/additional information since I am seeing the same questions. 

Filming capabilities: What I showed is a standard option* on all Model 3s. You have to set up the ability to record using a formatted USB drive (FAT32) and a folder on the drive called TeslaCam. YouTube has many tutorials on setting it up. Other Tesla did not have dash cam set up. He had 7,500 miles on his car (2k more than mine) hadn’t looked into dash-cam yet.

comment,c0bt9b,c0bt9b,,"Tesla didn't invent coil windings, that was Oersted that did that. It became standard to wind them as stacked spirals. The flat coil winding that Tesla developed was unlike anything before because it only works with High Voltage High Frequency Alternating Current. Tesla was not the inventor of AC but he most certainly was the inventor of High Voltage High Frequency Alternating Current (HVHFAC).  
  
Tesla claimed he visualized his designs on the back of his head, in a 2-inch square box, completely finished. He completely designed the entire electrical power grid, even to the point of using aluminum wire for the HVHFAC power transmission, down to every component. But, as soon as he was done with that, he basically saw it as obsolete, and developed the wireless transmission of electric power. There is massive historical confusion there. Wardenclyffe was not a Tesla coil, although it had one in it to act as a ""pump"", it was an electric energy harvester, and the power transmission was through the ground. He demonstrated the use of the flat winding resonant coil to the US Patent Office, with a working model. This air transmission of electric power is a different method, but Tesla said it would send large amounts of power around the globe, as easy as he was demonstrating to the patent office.

comment,c0bt9b,c0bt9b,,"> Tesla didn't invent coil windings, that was Oersted that did that. 

Oersted discovered the magnetic field of current and that looping wire increased the magnetic field, but he's not associated with any particular winding or coil, is he? 

Maxwell and Helmholtz invented certain coils that bear their names. Both their coils are designed to produce a uniform field within an interior space.

Tesla patented a coil winding for electromagnets in 1893 using multiple windings or multifilar wire wound in parallel and wired in series, [US512340](https://patents.google.com/patent/US512340). And that is the idea all these inventions except Thomson's share. 

And as I wrote in the previous comment, I believe at some point he said the Varley coil first patented in Canada in 1892 was also his idea. The Varley coil is the same idea in the form of a multifilar solenoid induction coil, which Tesla mentioned in his patent. People patenting Tesla's ideas for ignition coils and magnetos for internal combustion engines include Richard Varley, Richard Cunningham, James Seeley, Leon Jules Le Pontois, George H. Ennis, Frank Conrad, Edward B. Jacobson, John Heany, August R Luschka, Justus Entz, Harold P. Donle, Homer C. Snook, Alfons H. Neuland, Vincent G. Apple, Arthur Atwater Kent and Charles Kettering. Kettering is usually credited for inventing spark ignition, but Tesla patented disruptive discharge ignition 10 years before him.

comment,d5ejm2,d5ejm2,,"I have to say a 7:23 Nürburgring lap time with the 2020 Model S Plaid pre-production version is pretty darn impressive: the Taycan's pre-production version lap record was done a month ago, in August with 10-20 degrees higher temperatures, when the density of air was 3-6% lower.

For example in the Nürburgring straights when cars can reach their top speeds, top speed is in a roughly linear relationship with drag. I.e. if for example if Tesla top speed in yesterday's run was 290 kmh, then in August it would have been somewhere around 300 kmh, depending on exact air temperature on the track.

This is why most (EV) Nürburgring records are best set in warm weather.

Another thing is that the Taycan is not made in real volumes yet and there's a pre-order list, so if you order the Taycan today you likely will only receive it in about a year, when the Tesla Model S Plaid version is expected to be released.

This is why I believe Tesla is publicly showcasing track performance of next year's Model S Plaid, to reduce ~~cannibalization~~ any lost sales to the Porsche Taycan.

Regarding the lack of a SuperCharger at the Nürburgring and the use of a DC generator: should Tesla indeed officially beat the Taycan's 7:42 lap time I'm pretty sure a new Nürburgring SuperCharger is secured! 🤠

comment,davluw,davluw,,"I doubt a decent compressed air engine can be 3D printed.

This video seemed to imply Tesla only produced one reciprocating steam/air engine patent, but he produced several. One purpose of his reciprocating engines was to produce sinusoidal high frequency AC for lighting, wireless signaling and wireless power transmission. Another purpose was to produce a clock timing device. Another purpose was apparently to produce a vibrating engine for powering a shaking table for processing mining ores. A shaking table prototype is apparently the device that made Mark Twain suddenly need to use the bathroom in that one story. 

The way that the reciprocating engine worked as an earthquake machine is also very interesting. As Tesla described it, it was designed to operate with so little friction that it could respond to the minute sympathetic vibration of the structure to which it was attached, so it would begin oscillating at a very, very low rate and only speed up as the vibration built up in the attached object.

comment,dij9tx,dij9tx,,"Tesla said he originally thought of his bladeless turbine idea as a pump for pumping mercury while he was working for Edison in 1884. Edison's vacuum light bulbs were made using a mercury-column vacuum pump.

Geissler had used a mercury-column vacuum pump that was later named a [Sprengel pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprengel_pump) to make his discharge tubes.

William Crookes made his own copies of Geissler's tubes to study them to discover that while electrified, the gas inside was a different state of matter that he termed radiant matter in his 1879 treatise. Today we call Crooke's radiant matter plasma.

Crookes's experiments inspired Joseph Swan to invent the carbon filament vacuum incandescent light bulb. Edison copied Swan's idea from a scientific magazine and falsely claimed it as his own original invention.

Edison committed intellectual property theft like this repeatedly. He was an unscrupulous man devoid of honor, but he was wealthy enough to buy journalists to say what he wanted people to think about him and project the false image of himself as legendary that the poorly-informed majority of people still believe today.

Edison didn't invent the light bulb, he stole the idea, but he did mass produce it to sell at a lower price than Swan. As he achieved great financial success, he improved on Swan's idea. He used a stronger vacuum pump, so the bulbs lasted longer.

Tom Holliday (new Spiderman) plays Tesla for a few brief moments. Most of the movie is about the battle between Edison, played by Benedict Cumbermatch in one of the most mismatched roles ever, and George Westinghouse. The movie is a little more than an hour and a half. Another big theater release isn't going to help, but for the few people that never heard of Edison, Westinghouse and Tesla, this movie is going to totally screw with their heads.

comment,epf1o0,epf1o0,,"You're making assumptions instead of reading original sources to learn what Tesla was talking about. Tesla repeatedly said that his wireless power methods didn't use radio waves. He agreed the inverse square law dispersion of radio waves made it impossible to use radiated waves to transmit power efficiently over meaningful distances. It is apparently possible to transmit large amounts of power over distances of up to about one mile with low frequency radio waves, but the efficiency is low. Surface waves are more efficient than radio waves because they only disperse in two dimensions instead of three, but the methods Tesla intended to use were non-dispersive.

Tesla had multiple efficient wireless power transmission systems. One method used plasma columns or filaments to transmit power through the air and the other method transmitted current through the earth as a rotating magnetic field. 

Daniel Watts Troy and August Kloneck patented the lower efficiency radio wave and surface wave methods. John Hettinger and Conrad Reno patented wireless power transmission by plasma conductors. And Charles Roe patented the earth current method. I've posted the patents here before.

Tesla said Hettinger's idea of using UV light to create the plasma conductor wouldn't work because it was too easily affected by wind.

4. rotating magnetic field transmission through earth. This method could possibly be an alternative method of transmitting and receiving surface waves.

Notably all those methods can be accomplished without a giant tower.

Thanks for pinging me, here's a more detailed estimate:

Yeah, so it's ***production*** that matters, not deliveries/sales.

Here's the historic Tesla production numbers table [I posted over at /r/teslainvestorsclub as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/fg6uwh/elon_congratulations_tesla_team_on_making_our/fk3fey2/):

    year | Tesla vehicle production
       -- | --
    -2011 | ~2,500 (early Roadster)
     2012 |   3,100
     2013 |  23,187
     2014 |  35,000
     2015 |  51,095
     2016 |  83,922
     2017 | 101,027
     2018 | 254,530
     2019 | 365,232
   **total**  | **919,593** vehicles
     March 9 | 1,000,000-919,593 = 80,407
     **Q1'2020 full** | **110,400** (est.)


There's another 3 weeks left in March, and with Fremont production at 7k/week and GF3 production at 3k/week there will probably/possibly be another ~30k vehicles made in this quarter - this is the basis of the 110,400 estimate in the final line.",2201,True,1583831320.0,2020-03-10 10:08:40,127,0,__Tesla__,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/fg6smp/elon_congratulations_tesla_team_on_making_our/fk3fqt5/,True,,2020,both,top,False,False,0,fk3fqt5

comment,ftf878,ftf878,,"Tesla obtained several patents on reciprocating engines and engine-generators, which is what his mechanical oscillators were.  
・[Tesla reciprocating generator 1893 US511916](https://patents.google.com/patent/US511916)  
・[Tesla reciprocating engine 1893 US514169](https://patents.google.com/patent/US514169)  
・[Tesla reciprocating engine 1894 US517900](https://patents.google.com/patent/US517900)  

The main idea of the invention was reducing a steam engine and dynamo combination to the least complicated form possible by using reciprocating linear motion instead of rotary motion. Tesla said he used it to power the lights in his lab for a number of years after inventing it.

https://teslaresearch.jimdofree.com/oscilators/mechanical-oscilator/  
https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/articles/teslas-oscillator

As I understand it, the main concept behind using a mechanical oscillator to cause destructive mechanical resonance—which Tesla would later say could be used to demolish a building—is active friction reduction so the oscillator responds to the extremely feint sympathetic vibration that it creates in the object it vibrates.

---

Tesla did more with his reciprocating engines than I first remembered. He said it's possible to use a reciprocating engine to transmit vibrational energy through the ground for a mechanical form of wireless power transmission, and he pointed to great possibilities for using them for prospecting. He called this work the art of telegeodynamics.

> Elon Musk tweeted a complaint about Tesla’s share price that wiped $14bn off the company’s stock market value on Friday morning.

	Tesla did not immediately confirm whether Mr Musk’s tweet had been given legal clearance, and did not respond to a question about whether the company currently has a general counsel. Tesla lost three general counsels last year, one of them quitting after only two months.


	The Tesla boss, who has 33m followers on Twitter, issued his curt verdict on his company’s shares early in the morning in California on Friday, writing: “Tesla stock price is too high imo.”

Within moments the Tesla share price started sinking, dropping 10 per cent over the course of an hour before recovering slightly. The sharp move comes in what has been a hugely volatile period for Tesla’s shares. They slumped more than 60 per cent after coronavirus hit, but then rebounded by 120 per cent.

comment,gv6tjx,gv6tjx,,"To correct a small point in this, Tesla didn't think Marconi could signal across the Atlantic using only the single-tuned circuit radio transmitter and receiver that Marconi had patented, which is accurate. Marconi had to use Tesla's four-circuit system to succeed. The four-circuit/multi-stage resonance concept is necessary for sharp tuning at the transmitter and selective tuning at the receiver. Without the multi-stage resonant circuit concept, it requires impossibly huge amounts of power to overcome noise. 

Tesla first patented the two-stage resonant oscillator in 1896 ([US568178](https://www.google.com/patent/US568178)). He subsequently patented its use specifically for single-wire power transmission in 1897 ([US593138](https://www.google.com/patent/US593138)) and in 1899, surface wave power transmission and high-altitude plasma power transmission ([US649621](https://www.google.com/patent/US649621), [US645576](https://www.google.com/patent/US645576)). 

John Stone Stone patented the circuit for radio and he credited Tesla as the originator of the concept. 

Marconi used the four-circuit concept in violation of Tesla's patents, which was what the Supreme Court decided in 1943. http://www.mercurians.org/1999_Spring/rereading.htm

> Investors saw the proven successes of Marconi’s experiments as a safe bet over Tesla’s unproven ideas   


Unfortunately, they didn't know that Marconi was lying; that he'd been using Tesla's ""unproven"" ideas in order to broadcast across the Atlantic.   Soon Marconi company was selling Tesla coils, even selling Tesla's ""Extra Coil"" or ""magnifier.""   But he called them ""oscillation transformers"" and ""loading coils.""

[Marconi ad for 1kilowatt set](http://amasci.com/graphics/Marconi1KW.jpg)   
http://amasci.com/graphics/Marconi1KW.jpg

Another bit: William Preece of the UK govt. was working with Marconi, and they range-tested the Tesla transmitter.  They found that its range far exceeded Marconi's patented transmitter invention.  Preece insisted that Marconi license Tesla's technology.  Marconi refused.   Then (by pure coincidence?) Preece and the UK government suddenly broke ties to Marconi.  Why?  It's a mystery.  Marconi had to scramble to create a new company.

A couple of online history articles say that the UK suddenly dropped Marconi because of Marconi's overtly-planned idea-theft of Tesla's technology.   (Marconi did license patents from other radio inventors.  But never from Tesla.)",1213,False,1591172398.0,2020-06-03 10:19:58,5,0,wbeaty,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/gv6tjx/crazy_facts_about_teslas_tower_on_long_island/fsq6tt8/,True,,2020,tesla,top,False,False,0,fsq6tt8

post,i4k78c,,"Entirety of Nikola’s $36,000 quarterly revenue was from solar panel installation for the executive chairman.","https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/05/nikolas-entire-quarterly-revenue-of-36000-was-from-solar-installation-for-the-executive-chairman.html

People are comparing them to pets.com, but I don’t think even that company was this blatant at ripping investors off. Their “quarterly report” might as well have been a fat middle finger to both their investors and the SEC.

Oh btw the company is worth around $15B... and some analysts are saying it’s a “buying opportunity” given today’s dip.

**Edit**: for more context on the Pets.com comparison:

Pets.com had annual revenue of $619k for first year, and reached a market cap of $400M at its highest. Crazy bubble right?

Well Nikola has annual revenue of less than $100k (maybe a bit more depends on how many more solar panels the CEO is gonna order for his houses lmao), but reached market cap of $30B at its highest.

It’s literally 500 times more overvalued than the most infamous bubble stock during the dotcom crisis.

**Edit 2**: For the people who argue how revenue doesn't matter because they are the next Tesla.

For comparison. Tesla was founded in 2003 and 5 years later the original Tesla Roadster was on sale. They didn't go IPO until 2 years after that. Elon Musk also had a decent track record, being a co-founder and CEO of this small startup called PayPal.

Meanwhile Nikola Motors was founded in 2004, by a businessman with no real education whose resume is ""fluffy"" at best, and their six years of ""industry leading product development"" has yielded some fantastic CG renderings. 

Can Nikola be the next Tesla? Never say never, especially in the year 2020. But my bet is that Trevor Milton is closer to Elizabeth Holmes than Elon Musk.

**Edit 3** Ahahahaha apparently Trevor gave out more update of their factory construction (remember production is supposed to start in 2021) at yesterday's quarterly call...and drum roll......

comment,i83fts,i83fts,,"Tesla or possibly Hugo Gernsback commissioned this sketch. ~~It appears to depict some type of plasma beams connecting to the ground or upper atmosphere from the power receivers. Tesla said that transmitting power by at least one of his wireless power methods would create an artificial aurora in the vicinity of the power receiver. Where this sketch shows beams with straight edges, they might really be more like snaking plasma streamers.~~ People who lived in the neighborhood of his Long Island tower said it made incredible light shows at night.

The title of this post says it uses radio waves, but that's incorrect. It's easy to tell if someone doesn't know what they're talking about if they say Tesla wanted to transmit power by radio waves. Tesla repeatedly said radio waves couldn't transmit power efficiently because they are too dispersive. He had at least two wireless methods: point-to-point plasma conductors and surface waves. The method depicted here might be a hybrid of the two. He patented point-to-point plasma power transmission in 1897 (US645576) and surface wave power transmission in 1900 (US649621).

Books are disappointing too. None of the many biographies of him has covered his business, which was selling inventions to other inventors. No one has told that story yet, so it's very unlikely this film would. 

The villains of Tesla's story at least up to around 1915 are J.P. Morgan (first and foremost), Thomas Edison, Mihajlo Pupin, Elihu Thomson and Guglielmo Marconi. And they are heroes to too many other people, so it's unlikely the true story about what they did to Tesla will be told. 

J.P. Morgan caused the Panic of 1907 by spreading rumors about the Knickerbocker Trust (a large bank) in order to take control of Westinghouse Electric after Westinghouse refused to sell his company to him. Morgan already owned General Electric, and his business model was monopoly. 

The real story of Tesla is also not quite as tragic as biographies relate. For a long time, he earned a good income selling inventions.

Lightning is DC, direct current. Lightning bolts are due to direct current.  
  
The sparks from a Tesla coil are not DC, they are AC, alternating current at a very high voltage and high frequency.  
  
Tesla's Wardenclyffe tower was not a Tesla coil (flyback transformer) although it did have one inside that acted as a pump. The Wardenclyffe tower didn't have giant sparks, it was illuminated by the pulsing glow of ionized air. What Tesla was doing was ""pumping"" the static E-field into oscillation, like continuously throwing rocks in the middle of a pond, at a very high frequency. The aircraft are like a toy boat in the pond, being rocked by the waves. They are electric aircraft, not needing batteries.

He never filed patents for any disk aircraft. However, he spoke about an Electric Stratocruiser in 1911, along with a 3-view sketch, no wings, no propellers, later, in 1925 and the illustration of it is in the upper right corner of the magazine issue cover art. That is not a dirigible or blimp. That is an Electric Stratocruiser hovering, and it could then go supersonic once reaching the stratosphere. No batteries but did need operating energy harvester towers producing high voltage, high frequency energy waves in the Earth's electric field. 
The link below appears to be the original sketch he did for his interview during 1911. As everybody knows the lore, Tesla could hand draw extremely detailed engineering drawings but they were all the size of a large postage stamp, with his explanation that was how he saw things and the only way he could bring them out. He had a lifelong partnership with a machinist and mechanical engineer, and he is the one that did all the final drawings and model building.

Tesla kept a safe in his room. He was dead for 3 days before the hotel maid found him, because he had put a Do Not Disturb sign on his door. Tesla would not have done this, because he required a huge stack of linens each morning. Neither she or the hotel clerk noticed if the safe was open or not. The hotel clerk immediately informed the FBI of Tesla's death, since he was under FBI surveillance, and there were 2 FBI agents living on the same floor. The FBI says when they entered his room, the safe was already opened. The story is the hotel informed Tesla's nearest next of kin, his nephew, of his death, and the nephew hired a locksmith to open the safe. The nephew said the safe was already open and he had hired the locksmith to change the lock.

post,ipp3e9,,Don't be fooled. This IS The Market Crash: My DD.,"I've been researching this a LOT lately because I didn't want to get caught in it. Looking at trends and past data. I believe, strongly, that we're in the middle of the market crash. I used my knowledge and was able to fully exit my entire $500k portfolio on Tuesday, maintaining all my gains. I've even taken a sizeable position in SPY puts ($50k worth of Dec $260). I got my close friends out (well the ones who listened) on Friday at the first sign of positive movement.

First of all, a little history lesson on the [Minksy Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsky_moment#/media/File:Stylized_Minsky_Cycle.PNG). It's basically a theory for how market bubbles happen. It occurs in 5 steps. I will outline what they are in basic and how the current market looks in relation.

1. **Displacement**: This is the beginning of a new paradigm where the market changes in a big way. For this, that was the Coronavirus. This took place between February to April.
2. **Boom**: Increase in spending begins and major gains start to be made. Media attention and market involvement begin to increase. Currently, we've seen a HUGE increase in retail traders (who are extremely volatile) and massive media attention toward the stock market as it relates to corona news as well as stimulus and recovery speed gains. This took place between April and July.
3. **Euphoria**: People stop caring about any sort of reasonable investment strategy and just start throwing money at stuff. Tesla is a fantastic example of this, but many other stocks in the tech sector are guilty of this. July was the beginning of this phase as Tesla saw insane growth within a few week period and other companies followed suit very quickly. This continued into late August with Apple and Tesla going to stupid prices after their splits, and all the other big tech names reaching wild valuations.
4. **Profit Taking**: Smart money starts withdrawing funds from the market as they prepare for the crash.",13162,True,1599685339.0,2020-09-09 23:02:19,7749,1650,[deleted],stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ipp3e9/dont_be_fooled_this_is_the_market_crash_my_dd/,True,0.88,2020,tesla,top,False,False,0,
comment,ipp3e9,ipp3e9,,"I think your framework is correct, but your analysis is wrong. Here are some inconsistencies I noticed in your theory:

When you say:

>**Catalysts**: These are are things required to trigger a bubble collapse. Almost every bubble has had some notable catalyst(s) to trigger the rapid decline. As mentioned in Profit Taking, **we've had three catalysts occur so far that triggered panic selling. New Tesla shares, secondary Tesla offloading, and Softbank.** They are the big one and who I will focus on for a minute.

Why do you think Tesla stock split + dilution is a catalyst for the market crash? I don't think that makes sense. As for Softbank, they bought calls in mainly the FAANG stocks, they didn't buy Calls on the whole market. Could Tech stocks crashing back to say, April levels, bring us back to SPY under 300? Sure. But re-test and breach the March lows? No way, not with the amount of liquidity sloshing around out there with 0% Interest Rates.

It's very interesting that the bull and bear traps look exactly the same and they exist very close to each other on the spectrums (the bear trap basically leads right into the bull trap, post blow-off.). That's totally where my issue lies in my own argument. I wasn't sure if this was another violent shake-off leading into the last phase or if it was the crash itself. I'm still not entirely convinced it's not the crash though. Like you said, there needs to be confirmation one way or another.

It really doesn't take much to start a bubble crashing. One thing can cause others to compound on each other. Catalysts don't all have to be covid level to trigger a collapse. Looking into the dotcom bust, the catalyst was money managers urging their clients to rebalance their portfolios. That looks awfully similar to Tesla's second largest stockholder doing the same. Nothing is ever the same twice, and it's totally ridiculous to count Tesla as the main driver of this, but at the same time, they represent the emotional sentiment of this market as a whole.

post,j59ovh,,So Tesla's quality control is embarrassingly bad. Our brand new model Y's roof just fell off,"My dad bought a brand new model Y today, and he brought me along to pick it up just in case he needed help with any tech problems. Everything was going fine and we were driving back home when we started to hear a ton of wind. I thought maybe a window was open but a minute later the entire glass roof just blew off. After a brief panic we turned around and drove the new Tesla convertible back to the dealership.

When we got back we called highway patrol to tell them that there was a car roof somewhere on the 580, but somebody might have gotten into an accident, I’m not sure. The manager at the dealership said that either the seal for the roof was faulty, or the factory just ... forgot to seal the roof on? I can’t imagine how something as big as the roof not being attached could make it past quality control. If this is a recurring problem a lot of people could get hurt. Has this ever happened before?

Edit: The manager offered to get the car serviced for free, but we declined and are probably going to get an entirely new car. Whether we're still getting a Tesla is up to my dad but probably not.

post,ji0i4d,,How to profit off Global Warming: HVAC Market Research with Due Dilligence on 5 Air-Conditioner brands.,"# If you find this interesting please follow my account for more DD.

# I'm also working on an Excel file which will provide all fundamental data about a stock, more info about that on my account. TLDR at bottom!

**Introduction**

With the change and progressing to extremer climates, global warming is coming our way. It has been shown world governments are incapable of properly taking action against this threat. Since it seems like global warming won’t be stopped, we will have to start adapting to the new extreme climates. One way of ensuring a comfortable living/working space in this grim future is by making use of HVAC (Heating Ventilation & Air Conditioning). **And that’s what got me thinking**. My family has been hell bent on **NOT** getting air-conditioning. But with the summer temperatures ever more frequently reaching +40c with a humidity of +70%(Hup Holland Hup) it’s becoming unbearable. Sleepless nights, overheated pets, fainting, old people dying and just losing your will to live. These are all issues more people around the world are starting to face. Every place on earth is getting more extreme. Every place on earth is getting more need for Climate control. And every company is looking to profit of that! This is why my next play is in the HVAC industry. 

**Finding our compatible companies.** 

I only want to invest in the best companies. Living in The Netherlands I personally don’t know the best brands, luckily, I’ve got great internet. So, after spitting through some review sites these are the 5 public companies that came out best when looking for “Best HVAC/Air-conditioning companies/brands”. (Not ranked) 

1. Carrier (Day&Night, Bryant, Toshiba & 15 more)

2. Trane (American Standard, Thermo King & 7 more). 

3. Daikin (Goodman, Amana). 

4. Lennox (Service Experts, Allies Air Enterprises). 

5. Johnson Controls (Hitachi, York)

In my opinion, Tesla paint is not “crap”. There’s irregularities from a QC standpoint, so 1 out of every X vehicles might have uneven paint applied, or something along those lines. The rarity of that variable for X is probably much higher than you would be lead to believe. Although it might not be on par with the rest of the auto industry on average, and some customers are justifiably upset, the vast majority of owners probably don’t think twice about it, and experience no issues. I know 3 people who own model 3’s, all for 2+ years. Their paint looks great, nothing off about it, and they have no complaints. So, the upset minority speaks the loudest, and over-represents these types of issues. I’m not saying it isn’t an issue, people should expect better QC on the whole when purchasing a $50K car.

post,kpeffw,,Reasons We May Not Be in a Bubble,"I'm seeing a lot of posts comparing this to the 2000 dot-com bubble. Here's a breakdown of why we're likely not anywhere close to 2000 levels of craziness.

**First:**  During the dot-com era, the Nasdaq Composite's price-to-earnings valuation ran up as high as 200. By comparison, the index's P/E today is a relatively tame 28, only modestly higher from 23 at the end of 2019. 

**Second:** Interest rates were a very attractive 6% which provided a strong alternative to stocks. No such outlet exists today unless you trust bitcoin, or want to invest in paper gold.

**Third:** Much of the value gains we're seeing in the market can be tied directly to the fact that people who invest are making similar or better money this year, and spending significantly less causing them to save more and invest more:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html)

**Fourth:** The rest of the growth can largely be attributed to increased liquidity from all of the money printing. Stocks tend to mirror an increase in the money supply with their value making them a great hedge against inflation. The valuations of the 2000s weren't backstopped by QE or increased savings, making them much shakier.

**Fifth:** The money printing will likely go on for a while. People mistakenly assume we're printing against our 22T dollar economy when we're really printing against the 80-100T global economy for which are the reserve currency. A weak dollar benefits the global economy, and benefits us because we are the trading floor for the global economy.

This is a long but very illuminating read on why QE is necessary and actually helpful:

[https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/](https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/)

**My Take:** There are a few stocks that are out of control with their valuations (Hi TSLA!",2194,True,1609651162.0,2021-01-03 06:19:22,3040,882,Jq4000,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpeffw/reasons_we_may_not_be_in_a_bubble/,True,0.96,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,
comment,kpeffw,kpeffw,,"Perhaps we are indeed due for a dramatic correction. I think the difference for this ""bubble"" is in the quality/quantity of the underlying companies behind the securities.

In the dotcom bubble, there was a plethora of companies for every problem -- and they all promised to be the end-all, be-all.

Today, there are only a few companies for every problem -- and the reason the companies are worth so much is because there is no doubt that they deserve the faith bestowed upon then.

If I believe in online retail as an industry worth investing in, wouldn't a wise investment be Amazon? Would you say I'm being unwise to put money in Facebook if I want to invest in social media and marketing? Sure, there are other players that cover bases that the biggest companies don't do well enough -- but they are niche cases.

Even Tesla, which is arguably overvalued, is a company with great promise. If I had to put my eggs in the basket of a company that I believe will solve our transportation needs for the foreseeable future, it's them. Really, the main thing that's going to cause their valuation to pop is if they prove themselves to be unworthy of our faith.

Perhaps a good analogy would be: *In the 90s, we had a million Nikolas. Today, it’s a million Tesla shareholders.*

The investment thesis is that Tesla will be on the forefront of the EVs that we are driving. They will hold patents and intellectual property that will influence the entire auto industry in terms of decades.

Their battery technology will reinvent the way we think about every electronic device. Their solar innovations, everything we thought about power generation.

Think about it: Plenty of companies are trying to make a good EV. Plenty are trying to develop autonomous vehicles. Tesla isn’t trying to get us all in an EV in 5 years — they *fully anticipate* that our cars will drop us off for work, and then go transport other people before picking us up at the end of the day.

I really think that Musk is the Steve Jobs of transportation. If there’s a better way to do things entirely, he can see it, and he heads straight for it. He doesn’t chip away at incremental improvements to an unsatisfactory model; he makes the incremental improvements necessary to achieve the ideal solution.

Now, Tesla has plenty of wood to chop to get there. But is an investor’s faith misguided? Is there another company that is a wiser choice?

Realistically I think Biden needs to have a meeting with the D.C.

comment,kv1ton,kv1ton,,"""Under the doctrine of felony murder, which applies in the District of Columbia, any murder that occurs during the commission of one of several underlying felonies is chargeable as felony murder.

The classic example is if three guys go to rob a convenience store, and one guy is the getaway driver. If in the commission of the robbery, the clerk was shot and killed, all three of the participants in the robbery of the store are potentially guilty of felony murder,” said Heaphy.""

""You could look at the storming of the doors of the Capitol by that riotous mob as burglary. If they went in with the intent to steal, disrupt proceedings, to commit other offenses, they committed burglary. And, therefore, a murder that occurred during the course of a burglary could be potentially charged as felony murder,” Heaphy said.

The mere act of breaking into the Capitol doesn’t constitute burglary, Heaphy said. Prosecutors would need to prove that they intended to do something criminal, once they were inside.""

post,l1snpi,,Baupost’s Seth Klarman compares investors to ‘frogs in boiling water’ -ft," 

// Seth Klarman, the founder of hedge fund Baupost Group, has told clients central bank policies and government stimulus have convinced investors that risk “has simply vanished”, leaving the market unable to fulfil its role as a price discovery mechanism.

The private letter to investors in his fund, which was seen by the Financial Times, amounts to a damning critique of recent market behaviour by one of the world’s foremost value investors.

Mr Klarman criticised the Federal Reserve for slashing rates and flooding the financial system with money since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, arguing that the central bank’s moves have made it difficult to gauge the health of the US economy.

“With so much stimulus being deployed, trying to figure out if the economy is in recession is like trying to assess if you had a fever after you just took a large dose of aspirin,” he wrote. “But as with frogs in water that is slowly being heated to a boil, investors are being conditioned not to recognise the danger.”

The biggest problem with these unprecedented and sustained government and central bank interventions is that risks to capital become masked even as they mount

US stocks are up more than 75 per cent since their low in March, while spreads on corporate debt — a measure of how much extra interest corporate borrowers have to pay compared to the US government — returned to pre-Covid levels this month.

Mr Klarman — who founded Boston-based Baupost almost four decades ago and has grown it to $30bn in assets under management — underperformed the market in 2020.

He has been intensifying his criticisms of US central bank interventions for the past several months. In the latest quarterly letter, Mr Klarmen referred to the Fed as an “800-pound gorilla” that has priced out investors who typically provide liquidity in moments of distress.",3705,True,1611210018.0,2021-01-21 07:20:18,154,116,mag300,SecurityAnalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/l1snpi/bauposts_seth_klarman_compares_investors_to_frogs/,True,0.99,2021,both,top,False,False,0,

Is this not what the original Tesla was? They took pre-manufactured Lotus Elise car frames and put electric motors in. It's obviously not simple to source the parts or make the car as a whole to sell, but they were not building cars from the ground up in the beginning.

post,l3z5jq,,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

comment,l7fw2f,l7fw2f,,"First of all, I'll note that I'm not an expert in this, but here's my understanding. I'm sure someone will correct me quickly enough if I'm wrong (the fastest way to find something out on the internet: say it wrong, and someone will rapidly scream at you how much of an idiot you are)

Unfortunately there's no nice easy ""story time"" analogy like short selling to help explain it super simply. But Puts and Calls are fairly easy concepts anyway, with ways to over-complicate them. The simple version, in both cases, is you're paying a premium/fee now, in order to be able to buy (call) or sell (put) at a fixed price in future.

You pay the fee either way, and it's non-refundable. In return, you are given an ""option"" (choice) of whether you want to execute your put/call in future. That's where the name ""Option"" comes from - you're buying an option to buy/sell at a fixed price in future.

For example I might think TSLA is going to rise in price in the next year, but I want to limit my losses to 20% of my current holding in case I'm wrong. I can buy a Put Option on TSLA at, say, 90% of the current price, and pay a fee of about 10% of the current price. Then in a year, I have an option to sell my TSLA shares at 90% of the current price. I'm down my fee and the 10% loss, but if the price has dropped to 50% in a year, I've massively reduced my risk. The downside being that if the price goes up 20% in a year, I'm only actually up 10% because I've paid a fee for my Option.",2531,True,1611893728.0,2021-01-29 05:15:28,144,0,audigex,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/l7fw2f/elon_burn_ouch/gl6ydp8/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,gl6ydp8

post,l7qlfh,,Gamestop Big Picture: The Short Singularity Pt 3 - WTF edition," *Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low (average \~$67--I have to admit, the drop today was too tasty so my cost basis went up from yesterday)/share with my later buys averaged in), and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.  In this post I will go a little further and speculate more than I'd normally do in a post due to the questions I've been getting, so fair warning, some of it might be very wrong.  I suspect we'll learn some of the truth years from now when some investigative journalist writes a book about it.*

Today was a study in the power of fear, courage, and the levers you can pull when you wield billions of dollars...

Woops, excuse me. I'm sorry hedge fund guys... I meant trillions of dollars--I just briefly forget you control not just your own but a lot of other peoples' money too for a moment there.

Also, for people still trading this on market-based rationale (as I am), it was a good day to measure the conviction behind your thesis.  I like to think I have conviction, but in case you are somehow not yet familiar with the legend of DFV, you need to see these posts (fair warning, nsfw, and some may be offended/triggered by the crude language).",36029,True,1611920767.0,2021-01-29 12:46:07,7132,1662,jn_ku,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/,True,0.98,2021,both,top,False,False,0,
comment,l7qlfh,l7qlfh,,"Yeah... So I've found a pretty massive wrench in everyone's thesis.

The short interest results that were posted 1/27 were actually settled 1/15. There has been enough volatility in the past 2 weeks for shorts to easily close out without anyone noticing. If that's true, it would make sense for them (or anyone) to short again while above 300, especially if they knew the original 61 million shorts were already cleared.

People also keep saying ""Days to Cover is still 2.5!"" Yeah, that doesn't mean anything in a volatile market like this. Days to Cover, aka Short Interest, is a function of (Shares Shorted) / (Avg Volume). Avg volume is over the past 30 days. The first 15 of the past 30 days saw much lower volume. Current Short Ratio is closer to 0.5-1. If they could cover their entire positions in 1 day (causing a spike obviously), who's to say they didn't clear over a 10 day period (causing the spikes we saw), then, knowing they lost $4 billion (if cleared around the $62 price range, which I suspect), why not take out new short positions around $300? The price can't go up any more if there's no short squeeze coming.

Just my 2 cents. I get downvoted for this on WSB, so it's apparent no one wants to objectively discuss this very real possibility.

Gamestop on the other hand, anyone with half a brain and an internet account knows doesn't have much of a business model anymore (certainly not something to justify current valuation levels) so sooner or later people (even the amateurs) are going to realize that its in a price bubble unrelated to its fundamentals.

Normally this belongs in the daily advice thread, but because of recent events and concerns over Robinhood’s ability to serve customer(I been telling y’all for years) we can have a thread in it


So here we are: recommend and discuss brokers, fees, features, mobile apps, whatever.  In general I think everyone is best served by Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard.  TD is another major player but for those unaware they are in the process of being acquired by schwab.  All three of those actually have phone numbers where you can call and speak to a person about your account.

For the younger crowd; a phone call is similar to voice to text, but instantaneous. 

Also, feel free to chat apps or whatever too,

post,lcftzc,,10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.",9257,True,1612445969.0,2021-02-04 14:39:29,4129,498,pmchem,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lcftzc/10_interesting_and_useful_etfs_with_less_than_1b/,True,0.98,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,

I was thinking about this in relation to the [beta invite](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/27/spacex-starlink-service-priced-at-99-a-month-public-beta-test-begins.html) I got.   Any other company would have had it go through a marketing department, get corporate colors applied, and be A/B tested through like 12 rounds of revisions. 

It was obvious that someone at SpaceX was just like, ""This is funny send it out!""  

And you know what?  It worked well.  All those designs and revisions and everything else would have slowed down the process, and cost money and not actually added any value. 

If you think about those types of operations happening thousands of ways throughout an Elon company, you begin to see why they can get things to market faster than their competitors, and be more efficient. 

The actual beta experience has been really good.  Took us from ~8mbps to 150mbps.  Early on it had pretty regular downtime (about a few minutes every hour), but it's been improving regularly.  

It'll be interesting to see if speeds/performance suffer as more users are added, but if they can keep delivering the experience we've had, I have no doubt it'll be a long term success, at least from a demand standpoint.",1723,True,1612891039.0,2021-02-09 18:17:19,209,0,AtOurGates,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lg54b5/spacex_begins_accepting_99_preorders_for_its/gmptuxq/,True,,2021,elon,top,False,False,0,gmptuxq

Model 3 is no slouch when it comes to handling but it's not close to that level.

Plus the Taycan it's a lot faster and has a way more comparable range to the Model 3 than it looks on paper.

All of this is to say that, even the fact that you could compare the two is crazy, I'll agree with you.

The real comparisons that are ridiculously skewed to Model 3's favor are the ones that compare it to other luxury performance sedans at the same point, though. Like the Model 3 Performance is so much above those in terms of speed, practicality, and features, that one wonders why the hell would anybody buy anything else.

post,lm2mry,,"BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, is starting to ""dabble"" in Bitcoin","https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/blackrock-has-started-to-dabble-in-bitcoin-says-rick-rieder.html

BlackRock’s Rick Rieder told CNBC on Wednesday the world’s largest asset manager has begun entering the bitcoin space.

The remarks from Rieder, who is BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, came on the same day bitcoin broke above $51,000 for the first time.

“Today the volatility of it is extraordinary, but listen, people are looking for storehouses of value,” Rieder said on “Squawk Box.” “People are looking for places that could appreciate under the assumption that inflation moves higher and that debts are building, so we’ve started to dabble a bit into it.”

In January, BlackRock added bitcoin futures as an potential investment for two of its funds, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The funds are BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities and BlackRock Global Allocation Fund.

A number of other financial institutions, such as BNY Mellon and Mastercard, have made entrances into the crypto space in recent days. BNY Mellon, the nation’s oldest bank, will launch a digital assets unit later this year, while Mastercard intends to support certain cryptocurrencies on its formal network.

Electric vehicle maker Tesla also announced last week it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin using cash on its balance sheet and intends to begin accepting the digital coin as payment for its products.

The price of bitcoin has risen more than 70% this year, adding to a major rally that began in the fall. “My sense is the technology has evolved and the regulation has evolved to the point where a number of people find it should be part of the portfolio, so that’s what’s driving the price up,” Rieder said.

Despite bitcoin’s growing respectability as an asset class, Rieder said Wednesday that how much exposure an investor should have “depends on what the rest of your portfolio looks like.",2314,True,1613590487.0,2021-02-17 20:34:47,3646,1453,PZinger6,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lm2mry/blackrock_the_worlds_largest_money_manager_is/,True,0.97,2021,tesla,top,False,True,0,

post,lqfhuz,,Technology stocks are crashing – what now,"A friend just messaged me saying that his portfolio lost 10% of its value recently and that this was complete doomsday. Judging by the futures, the NQ is down 6.8% from its highs (a 1.8% gap down this morning alone). I get that, it's frustrating.

It is also noteworthy that the sell-off hurts technology stocks in particular. But mind that they were also the largest beneficiary in recent months:

* Nasdaq 100 is 53% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* S&P 500 is 31% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* DJIA is 19% above its weekly 200 EMA.

Which one is going to be hurt first and foremost once a correction is underway? Of course it's going to be the most stretched industry sector. Information technology is 28% of the S&P 500, and 20% of the DJIA.

If you buy stocks, you've got to have conviction in them. You've got to know what you are buying. Am I going to dump all my holdings just because they're ""overvalued"". Of course not. I'm going to hang in there with stocks going down 30% and then come back up 80%. Even if that takes another 3 years. It's the nature of the market and it is great at weeding out the less convinced.

Volatility is the price you pay for your returns.

If you held Apple all these years, you are sitting on a fortune now. Same goes for Amazon and many other megabrands of today. Amazon went top to bottom 60% several times in its history. You've got to have conviction in what you're buying to hold onto such kind of volatility. I also go to the grocery store to pick my favorite marmalade brand. If there's a 30% discount I'll pile up. But you cannot ever pile up if you don't have conviction in your holdings in the first place.

So here's what I would do. Go through your portfolio name by name. Ask yourself why it's there in the first place. Start with ""I own XYZ because..."". Warren Buffett had also advised it in one of his interviews. If you can't tell that story, sell it off. It doesn't belong in your portfolio.",2027,True,1614076976.0,2021-02-23 11:42:56,4052,1583,trendarchitect,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lqfhuz/technology_stocks_are_crashing_what_now/,True,0.94,2021,elon,top,False,False,0,
comment,lqfhuz,lqfhuz,,"Bonds are always being sold just like stocks are. Stocks have the stock market, bonds have the bond market.

Yields are going up because inflation is going up. If you are buying debt, and inflation is rising faster than the interest rate, then you're essentially _paying_ the borrower for access to your money. So bond buyers are demanding higher interest rates right now, causing yields to increase as well.

Then your super safe index investor begins to look at historically high bond yields compared to SPY and it's risks, and decides to invest in bond indexes. This outflow causes SPY and it's components to go lower. Someone that was invested in TSLA will look at how low SPY is and it's relative security, and invest into that. This will lower the price of TSLA, making it attractive to the CCIV holder, etc. 

The whole thing is a feedback loop because this shift into bonds really does make stocks go down, _and_ at the same time feel more risky, causing people to but ""safe"" bonds.

post,lt7oop,,JPMorgan advises clients to expose 1% of their portfolio to Bitcoin,"In a recent note to clients, strategists from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) suggested a one percent portfolio allocation to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

As reported by Bloomberg, JPM strategists Joyce Chang and Amy Ho opined that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against fluctuations from traditional assets like bonds, stocks, and commodities. However, they advised clients to allocate a small percentage due to the risk of major downturns in Bitcoin’s value.

After setting a new all-time high above $58,000, the value of the digital asset slumped to less than $45,000 and has been struggling to recover ever since.

Chang and Ho told investors:

>*In a multi-asset portfolio, investors can likely add up to 1% of their allocation to cryptocurrencies in order to achieve any efficiency gain in the overall risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio.*

Bitcoin has welcomed major investments from the likes of Paul Tudor Jones, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and MicroStrategy. The endorsement from JPM comes at a time when institutional players are rushing to accumulate the digital asset. As per Bloomberg’s report, America’s oldest bank BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has also announced plans to enable Bitcoin transactions for its clients.

The strategists were quick to add that cryptocurrencies should be viewed as an investment vehicle and opposed to being funding currencies like the USD or EUR. This appears to be contrary to earlier statements from other JPM analysts that called cryptocurrencies the “poorest hedge for major drawdowns in equities.”

So what do you think the retail investors will be buying this time? 

Tesla and other meme stocks?

Or they have noticed that there is a possible rotation in value stocks and will put it there?

Or will they think, put it on FANG and other high flying tech/renewable energy stocks that have dipped quite a lot the last two weeks?

If it was up to me I will tell them to buy ICLN/IQQH, TDOC, CRSR, NET,  and CSIQ because I have been really hurt by these during the past few weeks and need some support! :-).

[Latest Update!](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/m8ac8v/130am_update_still_trapped_at_a_supercharger/grji3sv)

EDIT:

FINAL UPDATE - Apologies for taking so long to give an update here, I just wanted to wait to confirm whether this was an ongoing issue or not. Once Tesla got engaged, they were great about getting the car in quickly and doing all the diagnostic work they could think of. They had even seen my Reddit posts, so they were up to date on the situation without having to explain anything.

The weren’t able to replicate the issue, but wound up replacing the charge port anyway to be safe. The data from the car suggested a voltage spike during charging which caused the charge port to enter a fault  state and shut off. It’s unclear why the cord would not disengage, but I’m assuming it was able to do so once that fault cleared itself overnight. This makes some sense as it was pouring rain a few minutes prior to us charging, which I was told is the main culprit for this voltage spike fault.

Since then, we’ve had no issues with charging (knock on wood).",1585,True,1616133469.0,2021-03-19 06:57:49,1709,0,SeaEnergy,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/m8ac8v/130am_update_still_trapped_at_a_supercharger/grgbbix/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,grgbbix
comment,m8ac8v,m8ac8v,,"This will sound stupid but I didn’t see it happen in the video nor have I read all of the suggestions and in your other post I saw almost entirely only mentions of pulling on it as hard as you can so might I suggest pushing it back in? This is something I’ve seen happen before with even the mobile charger and wall connector as the latch can get stuck in the channel just like pins in a lock when attempting a lock pick (for lack of a better example). And again I am basing this purely off the video as it seems there is only outward force being applied to it so maybe you already do this and have done this for this case, BUT, I would suggest always lightly “jerking” the plug both in and out after and even a little before pressing the button. You can feel and hear the plug give a little as it slides in and out ever so slightly and hits the limits of the lock and the channel (which is another reason I am suggesting this is because I did not hear that in the video). This basically ensures that the channel is lined up and not pressed on the locking pin which is holding it in either by the angle it is pushing the locking pin or friction between the mechanism and the cable insert itself.

I got a call this morning around 11:30am from someone at Tesla Service. She had already seen this Reddit post, had read all of the updates, and had someone on their way to inspect the charging station.

I then dropped off the car this afternoon at the service center. Everyone there had seen this post as well and knew what was going on as soon as I arrived. They said they’re going to take a few days to run some tests, look at the error logs, and try to recreate the issue. Probably won’t have an update on that until early next week.

I should mention that I’m not upset with any individual for what happened. Every single Tesla employee I’ve spoken to has been professional and (I think) did everything they can to help resolve this. The larger concern I have is around the organization and staffing decisions. If the future is in electric cars, we need to know that they won’t leave us stranded somewhere for 15+ hours while we wait for support.

post,mcpqqp,,"The SEC confirms it is investigating SoftBank for market manipulation. Softbank spent $17B worth of shares in the US tech market, with another $3.4B in bets to prop up their prices.","
https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/softbank-says-unaware-of-sec-probe-into-securities-trading

On Wednesday, short seller research site PlainSite posted a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter revealing that the agency is investigating SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications company and investing giant notorious for financing various unprofitable “technology” companies like WeWork, Uber, Compass, and Oyo.

Aaron Greenspan, founder of the Think Computer Foundation that runs Plainsite, filed a FOIA request in December 2020 for ""any investigative materials [from January 1, 2018 to the present] pertaining to the various SoftBank companies controlled by Masayoshi Son, specifically relating to SoftBank's trading of stocks and derivatives on those stocks.""

This request was filed in response to the revelation last fall that SoftBank was the ""Nasdaq whale.” SoftBank was responsible for stoking a huge rally in tech stocks, the Financial Times reported, because around August it began buying billions of dollars worth of call options in a shift for the company, fueling a rally that pushed up the share prices of tech companies it held billions of dollars of equity in.

Thanks in large part to a rally sparked by SoftBank’s high-risk market plays, firms like Tesla and Apple were up 74 and 21 percent, respectively, in the month of August alone. Executed through a small desk of traders and chief executive Masayoshi Son himself, the trading unit―named SB Northstar―and its bets won the company some $4 billion in gains at the beginning of September, before quickly melting away into nearly $3 billion in losses by the end of the month.

In a January letter responding to Greenspan’s initial request, and months after the reporting on Softbank became public, the SEC said that its search did not turn up any relevant records.",3308,True,1616645951.0,2021-03-25 05:19:11,3383,340,rrdonoo,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mcpqqp/the_sec_confirms_it_is_investigating_softbank_for/,True,0.99,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,

post,n6dh3d,,I sold every share I own today.,"I got into the market last year post Covid around May or June. Since then it has been an absolute rollercoaster trying to pick stocks. I was up 100% on multiple stocks including Tesla, Carvana, Square, Fiverr. I didn't sell because you're supposed to hold for the long term I heard, only for those stocks and others over many months to drop 30% - 80% or more. I bought some new stocks in February only for them to then drop 30% or more in a matter of months. I have spent months this year and last inside on beautiful days going cross eyed staring at charts trying to figure out what stock to buy, what to sell, why this stock is going up, why this stock is going down. As we speak I'm sitting inside on a beautiful day writing this. I have admitted to myself I don't understand stocks. I don't understand businesses. I have reached a point where I stopped caring about losing money. That's a dangerous road I'm sure. With the amount of stocks I've bought and sold, I don't know if I'm up or down.

Evidence I don't understand stocks is that today Twitter is worth less than it was in 2013 when it IPO'd. One of the most popular social media apps in the entire world I would have assumed would be worth something. Apparently not. It may seem I'm impatient or have a short term horizon for the market, but if I bought Twitter in 2013, I would have wasted 8 years of my life holding it.

PLTR backed by Peter Thiel and signing multi-million dollar contracts week after week, well the bottom just fell out. While it will probably go back up, I don't understand when and why it would. If a company with that much growth potential can't go up, what chance does anything else have.

10 months ago I bought DKNG at $25 and sold a few months later for about $50. Today it's worth a little more than was 10 months ago. I'm glad I got out when I did.

So, I am buying the S&P.

post,ncc7gx,,23% of Tesla's Q1 earnings were from Bitcoin trading - and they would have missed earnings otherwise,"Title says it all.

Tesla's earnings in the first quarter were $438 million.

$101 million (23%) of that came from selling Bitcoin for profit.

The other interesting part is that it would have been an earnings miss without the trading.

Did one make the other happen?

Considering the recent news about not allowing Bitcoin anymore, it's certainly a move worth mentioning.

comment,kv41b2,kv41b2,,"Tesla's atmospheric energy harvesting ideas appear to be disclosed in the 1921 patent of Hermann Plauson. It says a large Tesla coil (like Tesla built at Colorado Springs, 40-100 m diameter) can harness power from thunderstorms, but to receive significant power, the coil needs to be huge (1-100 km diameter). Gernsback's artwork for Plauson's work depicted a coil made of powerline. Plauson also used magnesium aluminum alloy balloons covered with tiny spikes electropolished and coated with amalgamated zinc doped with thorium or polonium. He elevated these balloons as high as 3 km. It's possible there could be a nuclear reaction between the aluminum, magnesium, zinc, mercury, thorium/polonium, plasma and powerful electric fields that increases efficiency that was not disclosed. Here's the 1921 American patent. https://patents.google.com/patent/US1540998

In a 1922 editorial Gernsback wrote Plauson got 720 W (400 V, 1.8 A) with a single balloon at 300 yards (270 m) and 3.4 kW (500 V, 6.8 A) using two balloons. He said one hundred balloons, 100 yards apart, will generate at least 200 horsepower (150 KW), up to 400 during winter (300 KW).

comment,kv41b2,kv41b2,,">Apparently Tesla wanted to combine atmospheric energy harvesting with wireless power transmission. His World Wireless System was intended to be a system of towers around the world for global wireless power transmission using very low frequency (4-12 kHz) surface waves.

We already have this in the form of VLF radio which, when you start getting into how it actually works, explains why Tesla's power transmission ideas wouldn't have worked. Even if you have an ideal surface wave you're still looking at 1/r attenuation. You can try this yourself even - set up a receiver for the VLF trasmitter SAQ in Grimeton at a distance of a 10-20 km, see what kind of power you get out of it. Bear in mind the antenna system has about 100 kW going into it, of which around 11% is actually radiated.

There are plenty of ways of harvesting energy at VLF frequencies and down. The problem is doing so economically.

comment,kv41b2,kv41b2,,"Surface waves are not radio. Surface wave energy is conserved in the resonator. It is not radiated. Any radio waves produced are counted as a loss.

One form of Tesla's surface wave method was apparently disclosed in the 1918 patent of Charles Roe. It feeds dephased AC through two ground paths. https://patents.google.com/patent/US1333095

This wave transmission method may explain why Wardenclyffe had a huge and complex grounding system that Tesla said cost as much to construct as the tower itself.

edit: Daniel Watts Troy patented the single-path ground conductor version in 1903. https://patents.google.com/patent/US776876

The way these use resonance to eliminate resistance losses between the transmitter and receiver comes from Tesla's 1897 single-wire power transmission patent. https://patents.google.com/patent/US593138

comment,kv41b2,kv41b2,,">No, surface waves are not radio. Surface wave energy is conserved in the resonator. It is not radiated. Any radio waves produced are counted as a loss.

The words you're looking for are near-field and far-field. Even for 4 kHz the near field only extends to at most 150 km (2λ). Granted this is in free space. The surface wave near field could possibly extend a bit further, much like how you can have reactive components at the far end of a coaxial cable. But this isn't really what the patent is claiming in the end. More on that later.

There are people that experiment with VLF transmission, so-called LowFERs. Some use antenna systems quite similar to this patent. The key to getting them to work reasonably well is low ground conductance, but not so low that the resulting antenna impedance is impractically high. There's practical upper limit on impedance, around 2 kOhm if I remember correctly, where the necessary ratio between the wire separation and wire diameter become physically impossible to achieve. All this can be simulated with FEM software if you like. The amount of reactance you can have in L or C are likewise limited, for similar reasons. Stray capacitance limits how small C can be.

The way the patented system might actually work relies on differences in conductivity. Things must be arranged so that G1-G3 and G2-G4 have much higher conductivity than G1-G2 and G3-G4, and the patent gives examples like utilizing rivers and other geographical features.

Tesla turned to patenting fluidics in 1909 as his big gamble on Wardenclyffe fell through. His main fluidic invention was his bladeless turbine that he said he first conceived while working for Edison, which was 30 years before he patented it. It appears he had already sold or given that invention to others before he patented it himself.

Tesla used his turbine in an electrostatic generator to pump a gas or fluid charge carrier. Apparently Alfred W. Simon patented it in 1933. https://patents.google.com/patent/US2004352

Tesla's bladeless turbine also appeared as the propulsion mechanism of a flying machine patented in 1944, which appears to be Tesla's ""perfect flying machine"" that he said he would give to the League of Nations for peacekeeping purposes.

He has a similar patent for a magnetic diode that allows current to pass One Way easily but is opposed by an opposite sign of current the other way. He converted alternating current into two branches of pulsating direct current with some batteries and a few electromagnets. A valvular conduit of electric current.

comment,nhaif4,nhaif4,,"Tesla did patent that magnetic rectifier and diode bridge circuit concept in 1889. It was apparently the first saturable reactor.

But you're mangling the details of his electromagnetic theory. Maxwell theorized the electromagnetic field (""ether"") must be incompressible, but Tesla disagreed. Tesla conceptualized the electromagnetic field as an ultrafine gas that only becomes more or less incompressible by electromagnetic forces acting upon it at the surface of conductors. He disagreed with the relativistic concept of considering space and time to be entities rather than metrics. He called the concept of space curvature illogical.

If anyone is interested I could post more about what Tesla called his ""dynamic theory of gravity"" and some contemporary work that appears to explain what he must have been talking about. I haven't posted it here before because it doesn't look particularly impressive. The contemporary work is all the work of one old engineer, and his papers are all self-published except for one peer-reviewed paper about the pattern of earth's stationary atmospheric electric field oscillations.

Instead of posting about it, here are links to it. It's interesting but weird. He built an ultraprecise electrometer and did a lot of simple experiments with it to reach very unconventional conclusions about gravity.

comment,nqs5v0,nqs5v0,,"On the highway, Autopilot depends more on the forward radar than the cameras. The radar is more accurate for detecting the range to other vehicles and it can ""see"" farther. The problem is that the radar attempts to filter out non-moving objects so that you're not stopping or swerving because of a discarded soda can or overhead sign. 

This is also the source of phantom braking. If we cull out too many non-moving objects, we hit parked emergency vehicles. If we cull out too few, we get phantom braking whenever a random piece of metal debris creates a radar reflection. This is a common problem for *every* auto manufacturer's radar-based TACC, not just Tesla's. Most of them solve it by removing *all* stopped-object radar returns and warn you (in the owner's manual) that it will not reliably detect stopped vehicles. They only activate the brakes when the obstacle is close enough to trigger Automatic Emergency Braking. 

Tesla is trying split the difference and develop a radar algorithm that can detect stopped obstacles yet ignore non-obstacle objects and debris. To do that, they often tweak the software to fine-tune exactly what kinds of radar returns are legitimate. That's why phantom braking seems to come and go depending on the software version.",1541,True,1622658353.0,2021-06-02 20:25:53,445,0,majesticjg,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/nqs5v0/autopilot_didnt_see_a_broken_down_truck_partially/h0cdt1d/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,h0cdt1d
comment,nqs5v0,nqs5v0,,"Stationary objects are a known limitation of pulse doppler and FMCW radar-based systems.  To avoid the radar return from the road surface being the largest and strongest return, any return with a velocity equal to the vehicles' velocity is excluded.  This gets rid of the radar 'seeing' the surface of the road, but also keeps it from seeing stopped objects. 

I would have assumed that the cameras' contribution in a Tesla would help overcome that, but maybe you found an edge case where the truck looked too much like one of the rock features in the background for it to recognize it as a truck.  With the haze and color, it does blend in a little.

post,nrw7cv,,Biden bans US investment in Chinese military and tech surveillance sectors,"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/03/biden-bans-us-investment-chinese-military-tech-surveillance

Joe Biden has signed an executive order that bans American entities from investing in dozens of Chinese companies with alleged ties to defense or surveillance technology sectors.

In a move that his administration says will expand the scope of a legally flawed Trump-era order, the US treasury will enforce and update on a “rolling basis” the new ban list of about 59 companies.

It also bars buying or selling publicly traded securities in target companies, and replaces an earlier list from the defense department, senior administration officials told reporters.


Chips with everything: how one Taiwanese company drives the world economy

The order prevents US investment from supporting the Chinese military-industrial complex, as well as military, intelligence, and security research and development programs, Biden said in the order.

“In addition, I find that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside [China] and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constitute unusual and extraordinary threats,” Biden said.

A White House fact sheet on the order said the policy would take effect for those companies listed on 2 August.

Major Chinese firms included on the previous defense department list were also placed on the updated list, including Aviation Industry Corp of China (AVIC), China Mobile Communications Group, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC).

SMIC is key to China’s national drive to boost its domestic chip sector.

post,pjh26x,,Is currently possible to use the Tesla Turbine in a practical way?,"Recently I heard about the Tesla Turbine, it intrigyed me so much so I started to search information about, so I'm not the most knowledgeable on the topic, but I found that even with the extremly high possible efficiencie of the turbine (over than 90%) this design is not prolificly used today.

The reasons for this that I found for this situation are the next:

* A Tesla turbine can rotate producing more than 35,000 rpm in practical aplications used for energy generators are needed very big disks, 2-4 meters diameter, in ideal operation the speed at the edges of the discs can exceed by several times that of the turbines currently used. As far as I know, no material in its time would be able to resist the deformation produced, in addition to being very difficult to control.
* Each turbine needs and specific arrangement for disks determined by the size of the bundary layer according to the fluid which will be used to power to the turbine. Any change on the separation between disks highly decrease the efficiency.

As I said I'm not the knowledgeable about these topics, but I was really interested to know if currently exist a material able to be used in a Tesla turbine, or how the problems could be solved. Neither I know if the original design is able to be used today with all its possible efficiency.

What benefit is there to having such a low number of employees? Lower costs yes but with the money they control and need to invest surely it would make sense for them to have more than just 13 employees doing this?

The only reason I see to buy USDT with usd is if you want to use an exchange that doesn't deal in fiat.

Say I bought 10$ worth of crypto and after the pump it is now worth 100$, before the dump I convert it to USDT (because I don't want to cash out , since I'm waiting for the next pump) , the concern here is whether the extra 90$ that came out of thin air is really backed by usd. That is , whether a company with ~25 employees producing no other product or service (other than USDT itself) has the capability to back ~60 billion usd worth of USDT with actual usd.

comment,pm19na,pm19na,,"This is a very short range wireless power system for electric trains. It might also be useful for electric vehicles today. Highways could charge your car without stopping or plugging anything in.

It was intended for powering multiple light railcars, which might mean 15-150 kW per vehicle with around a megawatt on a line. That would be enough to charge a lot of cars. It's also enough for power distribution, which means powered streets could replace overhead power lines in some places.

The line could reach higher voltage for the same insulation as an overhead line rather than underground, because air is more insulating than soil, but an overhead line carrying gigawatts of low frequency RF would probably expose people to excessive fields. It would be simpler with the line over the ground rather than in this underground conduit, but that would also expose people to stronger fields.

Tesla had a number of different wireless power ideas. This extremely short range induction power system was one of the first. He also had an idea to encircle a large area in a large 1-100 km diameter coil to supply the enclosed area with wireless power. Those two methods are two forms of induction.

comment,pjh26x,pjh26x,,"The short answer is ""No.""

But here's the more complicated answer: The statement ""possible efficiency"" is doing a lot of work when it comes to a Tesla turbine.

The rotor has been mathematically worked out to be capable of above 90% mechanical efficiency but thus far nobody has demonstrated the ability to solve the outlet losses on the design.

In reality there hasn't been any verifiable examples I've found of the unit much breaking 40% efficiency and this is not the kind of starting point where one wants to be when investing in making one with space-age materials.

Now be that as it may I think the Tesla turbine has some significant value. I think we should table the notion of the Tesla turbine as a super efficient machine and think of it as a mediocre one that has value due to its low cost/easy manufacture.

It belongs in places where robustness is key. I envision sufficiently large diameter Tesla turbines powering synchronous direct-drive generators running on air bearings powered by a run-of-river hydraulic air compressor (trompe).

While other turbine or pseudo-turbine designs would yield better overall outputs the benefit is that is the ability to make a cost-effective direct drive turbine that has no fuel costs, has no point of physical contact (air bearing) and doesn't need to be sharpened or filed down if left unattended.",3427,True,1631825083.0,2021-09-16 22:44:43,2,0,Cheebzsta,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/pjh26x/is_currently_possible_to_use_the_tesla_turbine_in/hd4j6n9/,True,,2021,both,top,False,False,0,hd4j6n9

post,qi92fg,,"I made $500,000 trading stocks and options in 18 months. These are the 15 things I did that worked best.","I failed a lot while trading before, during, and after succeeding. I haven’t counted it up, but it’s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I’m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I’d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. 

These are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.

**Understand the Trading Environment**

One mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.

**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can’t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. 

In between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that’s more likely to pull back.  It’s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).

I try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly.",17822,True,1635500383.0,2021-10-29 11:39:43,7971,718,Swingtrader79,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qi92fg/i_made_500000_trading_stocks_and_options_in_18/,True,0.85,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,

You should always run the numbers yourself and with your financial planner to see it fit your needs and situation based on age, income, state, other factors, different investment objectives. 

Hell Yeah, put in $100/mo in a safer, simple, and stable S&P500(VOO) first . Keep it for life especially in a maxed out Roth IRA and, HSA. 

 Put an extra $100/mo in a 3X S&P500(UPRO) .  Wait up to 5 years to sell $2k-5k gains tax free( long term capital).  This protects your gains without a 15%-25% tax penalty.  Use the realized gain to buy more S&P500 (VOO) and keep it for a life. 

Investing 2.0 is used if you have extra income, want to support faster VOO growth, and can tax loss harvest. 

VOO 10% annualized returns is only meant as a hedge against 5% future inflation and small retirement. 


The underlining S&P500 index would need to lose 34% in one day to be instantly wiped out in UPRO. Highly unlikely with exchange safe guards and risk management.  UPRO is meant as a short term investing. 

No one is saying puting all money or sufficient amount in UPRO.  $100 or 10% is adequate risk and benefit for UPRO.  

Example #1. Investing 1.0. Put $100/mo in VOO for 30 years returns an  est. $228k.  After  inflation, adjusted purchasing power is $113k in 2051.

Example #2 Investing 2.0. Put $100/mo in UPRO , total return after 30 years is $1.56M, $753k purchasing power in 2051.",1931,True,1635551328.0,2021-10-30 01:48:48,2,0,Food4Lessy,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qi92fg/i_made_500000_trading_stocks_and_options_in_18/hikwiod/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,hikwiod

post,qmjr7o,,"Tesla sells 1% of cars globally, yet is priced more than the companies combined that sell the other 99%","The valuation on Tesla is now beyond the absurd.  

Whilst European EV sales explode to presently 19% of all car sales this year, Tesla does not even make the top five EV sellers by company at a lowly 7%. (VW 25%; Stellantis 13%; Daimler 10%; BMW 10%; Hyundia-Kia 9%).

Tesla, unlike in the US, is simply being outsold by the vast array of alternative BEV models on sale particularly.  VW group alone offers the e-up, ID3 and ID4 (ID5 not yet on sale); Audi e-tron, e-tron Sportback e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT; Cupra Born; and Skoda Enyaq

In China Tesla has been pushed into 3rd place this year by BYD which has seen EV sales grow from 53K Q1; 98K.Q2; 183K Q3.  Tesla meanwhile has seen China quarterly sales for 2021 flattish at 69K, 62K and 75K.  China will likely sell 3 million EV's this year, half the worlds volume and Tesla sales are flat for the year.  Tesla might sell a lowly 9%.

Tesla dominates the US markets of course, where few EV models are on sale.  EV sales might be 3% of automotive sales.

Whilst investors will assert these stats do not.matter and Tesla's valuation is all about  tech, batteries and robo-taxis, it still does not sell any car related tech beyond its own cars.  Take up of FSD is a lowly 11%.  It still buys it's battery cells.  By its own statements it has a level 2/3 driver assist whilst companies like Waymo are already starting to offer level 4/5 robo-taxis in cities like San Fran (a free trial program has commenced).

With Tesla slipping badly in the two biggest and mature EV markets globally, it's EV mkt share has fallen from near 18% highs in 2019 to 14.7% YTD in 2021.  With Europe and China likely to see 20% EV sales, the Tesla domination of global car mkts story is looking utterly flawed, yet its market capitalisation is now than the entire companies combined that sell 99% of cars and are adding EV's faster.

From what I gather, a $148 million offshore bond payment due ""today"" still hasn't been paid, triggering formal bankruptcy proceedings against the company.  I believe that the deadline was midnight in China timezone, and the press release was filed right around there. We cannot know for sure if a last-hour payment was made at this point until confirmed further. But if this is all true , it could have some pretty strong short term shocks for the market.

For now treat this with a grain of salt until more verification and information. Either way, buckle up.

comment,qspovy,qspovy,,"This book is this random guy's uniquely unusual theories of radio propagation presented as his own Summers' theory of wireless. What makes it interesting is that the theories are Tesla's, and they're explained here in more detail than I've ever seen anywhere else. You can tell it's Tesla's by comparing it to Tesla's statements. The word choices used throughout the text are notably identical to Tesla's. It includes an explanation of Tesla's one-wire power transmission system with details that indicate the author had personal insight into Tesla's work. It mentions Tesla a few times, calling him the Father of Wireless.

If, like me, you have been looking for some key to decipher Tesla's seemingly confusing statements about radio that he never explained adequately, this appears to be it. 

Tesla said he visited Hertz in 1891 to explain an important error, but he never said exactly what it was. This book explains Hertz's error in a specific experiment and its implications for electrodynamics. To summarize, it says radio transmission takes place by two simultaneous processes. The first is air conduction, which it credits David Edward Hughes for discovering in 1879. Summers misspells Hughes. Hughes never published anything about it, but his findings created a sensation among European scientists. The second process, ground conduction, it notes is confined near the surface, which accurately describes surface wave propagation.",4926,True,1636769221.0,2021-11-13 03:07:01,2,0,dalkon,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/qspovy/revolutionary_theories_in_wireless_1920_frank/hkeqx0s/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,hkeqx0s

If anyone has a sense on when the irrationality will end, it's probably him and his advisors.

This whole thing about Elon trying to cash out some stock to pay taxes as a nice guy, was an obvious BS excuse. Then the media comes out saying his REAL intention is to pay taxes that are due. Brilliant, double play to cover for his personal cash out. 

If Elon had faith that his stock still had room to grow, there is no chance in hell he'd be selling. He'd just be getting a loan to cover his tax liabilities, while his equity value increases. The fact that he's trying to cash out shows he thinks it's near peak and about to go down. All the media drama is just an attempt to retain value for as long as possible to distract and justify his cash out.

post,r0m3yh,,I regret buying a Tesla and I haven't driven a single mile yet.,"This isn't a post about charging or the lack of physical buttons. 

This is a post about a complete lack of customer service. 

I preordered a Model 3 LR three months ago. I was given a delivery window of Mid November to mid December. I got a message last week saying it was my turn to pick up my car. Sweet. They give me a choice of three days on their website to pick up the car. November 24, 25, 26. I find it a bit odd that thanksgiving they are open but I'm working on the 24th and the 26th and on such short notice I can't get out of work. So I put down delivery for the 25th. After all other stores are open on thanksgiving and the site blacked out other dates. 

I get messages from Tesla that I need to get my car insurance and pay the down payment or I won't be able to get the car. No problem. 

I pay the down payment via their app and get the insurance. I upload the proof to their app. All good. 

Then yesterday on 11/22/2021 I get a phone call at 3 pm saying that I can no longer pick up the car on 11/25 because they aren't actually open. 

Uh ok. So you tell me this after I put down the down payment and pay for the insurance. I'm a little pissed at this point but I get it. Let me pick it up another day then. And why didn't you tell me sooner?

They would only let me pick the 24th or 26th. That's it. I asked them can I pick up the car on December 2nd because I have work and can't reschedule or get someone to cover me on such short notice. Their response is ""no, we can't hold the car that long. We will give your car to someone else and you can wait another 3-4 weeks for another car to come in.""

The heck? They made the mistake. Took my money. Made me buy insurance for a car that I don't actually have and then they try to bully me into a specific delivery date on short notice? That's not fair.

They are a popular type of pump today in specific applications, but as far as I've seen, the companies that make them never acknowledge Tesla in any way. 

Tesla wanted to use them for a type of fan jet engine for his flying machines, which he described in minimal detail in his flying machine patents. Tesla's flying machine concept was advanced further after his death by someone who looks like he probably got info from Tesla. I could post about that some time if anyone is interested. 

A Tesla turbine can also be used as a turbomolecular vacuum pump. Tesla patented that idea in 1921 only in the UK. [GB179043](https://patents.google.com/patent/GB179043)

He patented his cryogenic resonator a decade before Heike Kamerlingh Onnes discovered superconductivity in 1911.

Looking at his electronic inventions Plauson obviously worked with Tesla. Besides Tesla's idea of atmospheric energy harvesting, Plauson also patented the resonant induction motor, the underlying principle of which Tesla had first demonstrated in 1892. Tesla demonstrated the principle but never explained how to make practical use of it, and neither did anyone else until Plauson patented it in 1919. Plauson also included the idea for citywide wireless power in his patent. The coil around a city for energy harvesting would also provide wireless power transmission with very high transmission efficiency. Induction is normally only thought of as a very short range transmission method, but everywhere within a huge coil, the transmission distance is zero, so induction is very efficient.

comment,qspovy,qspovy,,"**26—Work of Hertz.** It was about the year 1888 when a German physicist, Heinrich Hertz, made some experiments that were of untold value to science by confirming in an experimental way the theories of Maxwell, that wireless waves and light were similar. While he thought these wireless waves, when detected at a distance from an induction coil was by electromagnetic induction alone. Science quickly accepted this theory and here was the beginning of the system of electro-static oscillations as used today for the transmission and reception of intelligence around the world. Prof. Hertz used a coil of wire, and when placed in a conductor of strong invisible electric currents, enough electricity was conducted to the coil to produce a visible spark when the two ends of the coil were close together. When this coil was close to the spark gap of the induction coil electro-static and magnetic induction was no doubt the cause of part of the current in the Hertz coil. But the air acting as a conductor for the invisible electric waves was by far the greater and dominating cause. But this electro-static and magnetic field only exist a very short distance from the induction coil of wireless transmitting station and the electro-static currents travelling by conduction through the air are the sole cause of our wireless detectors responding to same. The electro-static and magnetic field quickly dies out.

comment,r93ixi,r93ixi,,"I've never heard that. I'm curious where you did. It is an interesting idea. 

A Chicago inventor, Albert G Whitney proposed building a railway around the equator with the trains pulled by tethered satellites. That was probably Tesla's idea or influenced by him. Of course that's probably not practical, but it's still an interesting idea. A coil around the equator could be used to receive current. 

The atmosphere already does absorb electromagnetic energy from space. The process could be manipulated for energy harvesting or to modify the atmosphere. The magnetosphere is made out of huge plasma tubes spanning north to south that rotate by the energy they receive from space. 

The most immediate use for modifying the atmosphere would be to address global warming. The heat of the atmosphere is a function of the pressure of positive ions, which means efficient means to neutralize positive charge could be used to cool the atmosphere. For example, fountains could be used as neutralizer-ionizers to allay urban heat islands. 

Electrostatic atmospheric manipulation is probably complicated by the solar wind. Plasma conductors thru the troposphere would heat the atmosphere by drawing positive ions in. It might be necessary to confine positive charge outside the troposphere to control the charge within it without interfering with the field above.

post,rxqpdy,,How long can a Tesla survive stranded on a freeway in the winter? I did the math to find out.,"After reading the Washington Post article about electric cars being unsuitable when stranded on a freeway in the winter, I decided to do an experiment to find out the truth.

**The Scenario**

* My Model X was fully preconditioned prior to the start of the test
* The battery was charged to 80% prior to the start of the test
* Temperatures here in Michigan today were very uniform.  20 degrees all day.
* After preconditioning, the Model X was parked in my driveway for the test period
* Seat heaters, and steering wheel heaters were activated.  
* Cabin temp set to 70 degrees.  HVAC on Auto mode.
* Camp Mode was started, and the car was left in the driveway for the test period
* Vehicle doors will remain closed during the test period.  Mobile App used to acquire data every hour.
* Test duration:  5 hours

**The Raw Data**

* 79% - 207 miles - 11:45am - **Test Start**
* 76% - 201 miles - 12:53pm
* 74% - 196 miles  - 1:46pm
* 69% - 181 miles - 3:48pm
* 67% - 175 miles - 4:45pm - **Test End**

**The Results**

* Model X used an average of 2.4% of battery per hour throughout the test period
* Range went from 207 miles, to 175 miles at the end of the test.
* 5 hours of Camp mode utilized…
   * 32 miles of range
   * 12 % of range
* 24 hours of Camp Mode would require (extrapolated)…
   * 153 miles of range
   * 58% of range

This data conclusively proves that a Model X can easily keep all passengers in complete comfort during a 24 hour duration event while stranded on the freeway in the winter, using less than half of the maximum battery capacity.  All the while, the passengers have access to Netflix, video games, and plenty of online entertainment.

&#x200B;

Next step - I might re-run this same test tomorrow with my Model S.

comment,sf20o4,sf20o4,,"I've seen this interview before. It's remarkably dull for how interesting what they're talking about should be. 

Stan Deyo, the interviewer who made that documentary, applied for a patent for an energy harvesting device in 2007. He said it's a version of Tesla's system. It appears to be Tesla's radiant energy concept. It uses high voltage on an aerial unipolar capacitance with a simple resonant circuit to harness electrostatic wave energy particularly 4.5-7 MHz, which is produced by random pressure waves propagated in the troposphere by the impacts of the solar wind and cosmic particles with the ionosphere. He cites Trump's research to describe how it works in the patent, which makes it seem like he got the idea from him.  https://patents.google.com/patent/US20080191580A1

edit: I found Stan Deyo has a YouTube channel where he has this documentary including this interview in better quality. https://youtu.be/KLJMQn4cZPs?t=1524

I'd seen his patent before, but I didn't think there was much to it because it's brief and more importantly I thought the frequency of the ambient energy must be lower.

comment,uvmhig,uvmhig,,"This is the best biography of Tesla's youth I've ever read. It provides considerable detail about events in Tesla's early life that he mentioned in his autobiography. It reads like an addendum to Tesla's autobiography that fills in the details. 

For instance it explains why as a child he became determined to become a genius before he knew what the word meant and pushed himself so forcefully to that goal. It says what he was doing when he got trapped in the abandoned church and how he was rescued. It says Tesla was so mad at Edison for lying about the promised bonus of $50,000 that he didn't tell anyone he quit. He just walked out without saying anything to anyone and never came back.

Unfortunately the author seems to lose track of everything Tesla did after around 1894-1900. It's clearly wrong about many things after the period it covers well. For instance it says Tesla and JP Morgan were good friends throughout their lives and that Morgan gave Tesla the money for Wardenclyffe without any conditions, but we know that's not true. Tesla sold Morgan the controlling stake in his wireless tech for the $150k he got for Wardenclyffe, which was only half the cost of constructing it. And then Morgan refused to sell it back to Tesla when Tesla subsequently wanted to work with other investors who actually wanted to see it work. Morgan wanted Wardenclyffe to fail and made that happen.",2000,True,1653261816.0,2022-05-23 01:23:36,3,0,dalkon,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/uvmhig/nikola_tesla_electrical_genius_arthur_j_beckhard/i9mdfpq/,True,,2022,tesla,hot,False,False,0,i9mdfpq

I do have to say though, not to contradict you, but the part about Tesla and JP Morgan is true. Tesla held no I’ll will towards him and the story is all part of the BS fantasy that has been built around Tesla. Check out what Tesla said in his own words about JP Morgan and even the government.

From “MY INVENTIONS V - THE MAGNIFYING TRANSMITTER”

“The tower was destroyed two years ago but my projects are being developed and another one, improved in some features, will be constructed. On this occasion I would contradict the widely circulated report that the structure was demolished by the Government which owing to war conditions, might have created prejudice in the minds of those who may not know that the papers, which thirty years ago conferred upon me the honor of American citizenship, are always kept in a safe, while my orders, diplomas, degrees, gold medals and other distinctions are packed away in old trunks. If this report had a foundation I would have been refunded a large sum of money which I expended in the construction of the tower.

comment,uvmhig,uvmhig,,"Thank you for the kind words and also pointing that out. 

That doesn't mean it's true either. That only means Tesla said it was true too. Tesla was apparently always much nicer to Morgan than he ever had any known reason to be. All that means is Tesla never wanted the public appearance of not getting along with Morgan. 

I don't believe the nice things Tesla said about Morgan are true, but that is another way that this book agrees with everything Tesla said to such an extent it seems like it could have been written by Tesla. It's possible Tesla wrote this book or most of it. Maybe he intended for it to be published for his centennial in 1956, but Beckhard didn't manage to get through editing and publishing in time for that. 

Despite the nice things Tesla said about Morgan publicly, the truth was finally revealed when the Tesla Museum released his telegrams. That's how we know Tesla was lying by saying his relationship with Morgan was always good. We can only speculate why—most likely out of misplaced hope Morgan would return the kindness. 

It's also worth noting Morgan was the money behind Edison and Marconi and everyone else who ever wronged Tesla and Westinghouse. And most importantly, Morgan intentionally stymied Wardenclyffe and Tesla's wireless power plans and stole the invention of radio from him for Marconi. Morgan gave Tesla every reason to hate him.

I mean, not really. Delaware Chancery Court is going to force him to go through with the sale at the $54.20 price specifically for all of the reasons you just said. Elon has *every financial incentive* not to do what he's doing, but he's got an addictive personality and, right now, he's addicted to shitposting.

He's going to instantly lose billions of dollars by spending $44B on a company that's worth, at most, about $20–30B. Not only that, but as his debt financing expires, he may be compelled to sell huge quantities of TSLA shares at a significant discount just to complete the purchase. 

On top of the billions he's going to lose in the sale, the SEC is also likely to fine him a giant amount of money or ban him from serving as an officer of any publicly traded company.

Elon's sitting comfortably in the ""fuck around"" phase right now, but the ""find out"" phase is coming. He can save face by following through on the $54.20 deal without forcing it through court.

comment,v1itrt,v1itrt,,"I’m the opposite of a Tesla fanboy, but what large NYSE listed car manufacturers aren’t down significantly? Ford is down 50%, GM 40%, and even Toyota and Ferrari have been down close to 30%.

Tesla gets the headlines because of its overall valuation, but on percentage terms, it’s only down marginally higher than other large car stocks.

Having said that, investors priced Tesla at its peak like it’s the Apple of car stocks. The car industry is vastly different, and I’m of the opinion that the new Toyota EV (the Toyota BZ4X) is going to fly off the shelves. Not because it’s the best EV or has the best performance figures, but because Toyota has some of the most loyal customers in the world. It’s perceived as the most reliable and trustworthy brand, and it’s why the Corolla and RAV4 are the two highest selling cars by volume in the world. The Corolla isn’t the best car in its class, but everyone that buys it knows what they’re getting (reliability, ease of use, build quality, resale value, good capped priced servicing etc).

Tesla don’t even make the best EV in the world. The best EV according to various 2021 car of the year awards is the Kia EV6. 

The interesting aspect to Tesla that I’m waiting to see play out is the polarising views of Musk himself.

I think after the second quest you wait a few more days and you can return to the house and find the lantern laying around. Maybe there is a 3rd quest before the lantern, I don't remember, just keep waiting and going to the house until it appears

comment,vn01fj,vn01fj,,"This patent describes simple apparatus that consists of a Tesla lightning protector positioned over a spark gap that is used to collect atmospheric energy. A Tesla lightning protector is an ultra high voltage terminal. The spark discharge is used as an antenna to collect both atmospheric charge and ambient thermal energy. The author says the electric thermal energy of the atmosphere is much greater than the energy of atmospheric electric charge. 

Among other inventors Hermann Plauson and Ewald Rasch patented similar concepts in 1920. Rasch used an arc discharge from a kite: [GB179967](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/010335657/publication/GB179967A?q=pn%3DGB179967A). Plauson used radioactive metal balloons flying over spark gaps hanging beneath the balloons and also at ground level: [US1540998](https://www.google.com/patent/US1540998). Apparently they also explained this same electric thermal energy concept, but their explanations were not as clear. Serafino Orlando explained the thermal energy more clearly in 1924: [GB231247](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/009699504/publication/GB231247A?q=pn%3DGB231247A). 

This patent explains the conventional Wilson thunderstorm theory of atmospheric charge (1920) is wrong. It says the thermal electric energy of the atmosphere is the real cause of atmospheric charge. 

It draws this thermal electric energy from the atmosphere by imitating the process of thunderstorms.",3630,True,1656458222.0,2022-06-29 01:17:02,5,0,dalkon,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/vn01fj/active_antenna_to_collect_atmospheric_electricity/ie4a7nq/,True,,2022,tesla,top,False,False,0,ie4a7nq

comment,ws330d,ws330d,,"Al Hubbard was not known to be a protege of Tesla, but he must have been because he invented something Tesla had invented, a nuclear reactor so simple that it doesn't appear to be a nuclear reactor. It was a more advanced form of the same reactor first patented in 1896 by Tesla protege Nathan Stubblefield. 

This type of reactor is so simple that it's not much more than an electromagnet or array of electromagnets. It is a type of breeder reactor that requires only a tiny amount of highly radioactive material. Most of the material it uses is unenriched thorium and uranium crude ore. The small amount of enriched material may be as little as 50-100 mg of radium, enriched uranium, polonium, radon or pretty much any alpha emitter. Radon has the advantage of being an abundant byproduct of nuclear energy production and nuclear waste storage. As a gas it is unwieldy, but it could be used in a permanently sealed ampoule. 

Apparently Stubblefield's patent prevented Hubbard from obtaining a patent for his version of it. The Pittsburgh-based Radium Corporation of America bought the rights to Hubbard's invention and shelved it. That was the fate of all of Tesla's most powerful inventions. 

Tesla mentioned he discovered atomic radiation before anyone else a number of times, but he never tried to take credit for the true extent of his contributions. Tesla was the unsung true father of nuclear physics.

comment,x94ecz,x94ecz,,"Hello, Dr. Seifer. I hope you have a good response to your AMA.

I think Tesla occupies a unique position in the mind of America. I have not yet read your book, but as an example, let me site Spider Robinson, the Canadian author of the Callahan Cross-Time Saloon novels. In Callahan's Key, Tesla plays a pivotal role and he's a fantastical character with mastery over electrical knowledge that mere mortals cannot fathom.

My question: how do you think your book will address the popular idea that Tesla was, for lack of a better term, a wizard - considering that you actually named one of your books about him ""Wizard at War""?",627,False,1662657110.0,2022-09-08 19:11:50,7,0,[deleted],Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/x94ecz/im_marc_j_seifer_noted_biographer_of_tesla_who/inm29jt/,True,,2022,tesla,hot,False,False,0,inm29jt

And I found to my astonishment that Tesla was actually negotiating with Joseph Stalin himself! and that FDR himself when he was president was trying to meet with Tesla at the height of WWII, so we now had to come up with a title for the new book and because he was the ""w"" word, we wanted to keep it in the title and that's how I came up with TESLA: WIZARD AT WAR.",844,False,1662657955.0,2022-09-08 19:25:55,11,0,Marc-Seifer,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/x94ecz/im_marc_j_seifer_noted_biographer_of_tesla_who/inm4ibe/,True,,2022,tesla,hot,False,False,0,inm4ibe
comment,x94ecz,x94ecz,,"Tesla was a Serb and to understand the Serbian people we need to know and appreciate what is known as the Battle of Kosovo which took place in 1389 (over 600 years ago!).  The Ottoman Empire were a brutal bellicose group who would slay the men, put their heads on stakes, rape the women and convert the children to their way of life. The Ottoman Empire was about to invade the whole of Europe, but to get there, they had to go through Serbia, and as Tesla states, ""Europe can never repay the great debt it owes the Serbians for checking, by the sacrifice of its own liberty, that barbarian influx."" 30,000 Turks died but the Serbs had comparable losses and their great kingdom which had a benevolent king, was destroyed in the process. According to Professor Markovitch who attended one of my lectures, ""It follows us always."" So every Serb knows that their utopian past was shattered on that day. Thus, Tesla set out to try and figure out a way to end all wars. However, for him to do this, he thought if he could come up with a truly horrible weapon, then no nation would be stupid enough to go to war, so he invented drone warfare through a remote controlled torpedo in 1898 during the Spanish American War and then the particle beam weapon, which was also called the death ray in the run-up to World War II. Tesla also billed this weapon as a ""peace ray,"" for that reason. If every nation had a perfect means of defense, war would end.

Second, I went with a Tesla because the technology was way above (IMO) the rest. Very much best in class, even though I feel like the outer design is a little too “different” for my taste. I’ve really enjoyed driving it. But the gap is quickly closing, and some of the design decisions and manufacturing makes me scratch my head.

The “ashamed” part, however, stems from the leader of the organization. He has become so polarizing that I can’t even have a conversation with people I meet regarding my Tesla without his name coming up. It makes me feel like people are looking at me as if I share his views because I own one. I wish he would just fade into obscurity with his billions and call it a win.

comment,z1qfgx,z1qfgx,,"The War of Electric Currents, a historical power struggle between two brilliant inventors - Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla - has shaped the world as we know it today. Supported by George Westinghouse, Tesla championed alternating current (AC) against Edison's direct current (DC), a battle that decided the future of electricity transmission.  
  
Edison, an ardent proponent of DC, held initial sway due to his established reputation. However, Tesla's AC system, more efficient and economical for long-distance transmission, had an inherent advantage. When Westinghouse, a shrewd industrialist, threw his resources behind Tesla's AC system, the tide began to turn.  
  
Westinghouse's win symbolizes a timeless lesson - superior technology often prevails, but not without the right support and resources. Today's electric grid, largely based on AC, stands as a testament to Tesla's foresight and Westinghouse's determination in the face of fierce opposition.",963,False,1687145454.0,2023-06-19 05:30:54,2,0,Maleficent_Soup4017,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/z1qfgx/ac_or_dc_how_nikola_tesla_enabled_george/jonw4hu/,True,,2023,tesla,hot,False,False,0,jonw4hu

post,151kpky,,I’ll never doubt Tesla’s navigation again,Driving from San Diego to Phoenix. The navigation routed me off the interstate and through the mountains saying I’d arrive at the next charger with 10%. Once I hit the point of no return I started realizing that there was no way I could possibly make it with enough battery to the charger. I was down to 3% with nearly 30 miles to go but it was still saying I was going to make it with 10%. Panic set in. AC and music off. Windows down. Wife getting our AAA info ready to have to call a tow truck. We were in the middle of nowhere with nowhere to even pull over off the road. Just as I was about to give up a road sign said “watch for braking downhill next 20 miles” next thing I know regenerative braking had my percentage slowly climbing. I climbed 8% during the downhill portion of the drive and made it with 10% just as it said I would. Tesla is a truly incredible machine.

20 miles south of Blanding there's a restaurant with some Level 2 chargers but that is it until Gallup.

The headwinds were fierce that day. ABRP Pro was picking up on that. The Tesla NAV not so much apparently. 

By the time I got to the restaurants, the arrival charge had dropped from 30 to 20%.

I added 5% more at the restaurant and arrived in Gallup with 10% just about where ABRP predicted and 20% less than the NAV predicted.

Tesla NAV has gotten better over time but it still routinely lowers it's estimated arrival SOC by 10% while you are in the middle of a drive.

The seats on our X are incredibly good and supportive.  I regularly drive 6.5 hours to go visit my sister and we arrive feeling fresh.  Teslas are ridiculously and exceedingly good for road trips for a number of reasons: a lot of the toll on driving is related to stress (which is greatly reduced when the car handles a lot of the tasks for you) and being forced to stop every few hours for a quick charge is actually a great way to allow the occupants to stretch out, relax, etc.  I used to get much more tired driving 5.5 hours on our ICE vehicle, than 6.5 on the X.

comment,160ybh0,160ybh0,,"Agreed its a great road trip car and I've done 2 road trips that are similar to this one in the Model 3.  But... if I was being real, the model S 2021+ is probably a better machine to do these kinds of trips.  I found it can be a grind to stop frequently when the following things happen.

1. You're in a state where the limit 80+ so you're really eating that battery and going slower would feel less safe.
2. Wind.  Head winds... especially at 30/40 + in the new mexico / arizona area.  ouch.
3. Cold.  In the north areas, even in the central areas in the Winter, especially at night, noticeable hits.  (granted, ours doesn't have the heat pump...)
4. Combinations of the stuff above.

comment,1679b6n,1679b6n,,"if you want to get your hands dirty with a prototype of your own we are now selling versions of the 4.5in Tesla Turbine that we built during our video collab with Integza 

www.HeatAndPower.com       

www.TesTurEnergy.com 

Crafted with precision, the prototype boasts a robust design featuring an aluminum disc stack enclosed in a high-quality polycarbonate casing.      

The turbine is tailored to accommodate a variety of testing conditions, though currently optimized for compressed air tests.      

From initial trials, the turbine has shown promising potential, generating 1200 watts of power on a Dyno test with 30-40psi and a notable 250 watts electrical load when partnered with an upgrade generator package) on just 15psi of compressed air.  

It is also designed for future upgradeability, with provisions to accommodate a 2-stage upgrade we aim to release soon.      

While this turbine is a working prototype, it’s not a complete, turnkey solution or operational turbine. 

So, what’s the purpose of this unit?      

We’ve designed and are selling this prototype to provide a hands-on, engaging, and informative tool for those interested in our renewable energy systems, and specifically in Tesla turbine technology.      

It gives you a chance to see the turbine in action, understand its mechanics, and gain experience with assembly, disassembly, and maintenance.",2642,True,1693580008.0,2023-09-01 16:53:28,4,0,TesTurEnergy,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/1679b6n/integzas_building_nikola_teslas_bladeless_turbine/jyoarap/,True,,2023,tesla,hot,False,False,0,jyoarap

I bought a MYLR with all the add-ons for $55K in May of 2021 (picked up in August ‘21).  I traded it in in for approximately $60K in June of ‘22.  At that time I exchanged it for a MYP for $62K. Net cost $2K. 

Today I could sell my MYP for about $50K.  A very modest depreciation over 18 months.  And the original MYLR actually “appreciated” due to the demand and price spike.  

You simply bought a car at the very top of the COVID pump.  And now you’re trying to sell it at the end of the sales year when Tesla is dropping prices to make their end of year numbers.  

Lots of other cars are seeing a much worse issue because dealers were adding $20-30K to the price of their cars above MSRP.  And now they have a huge glut of inventory.

I've also decided to put all the 3D printed parts required to build this online at [dartsolar.com](https://dartsolar.com) \-- if you want me to build you one, or if you want to get the free 3D parts and the blueprints for this build enter your email in the green box on the link.

The reason I can pack so many solar panels is because I am using telescoping carbon fiber tubes as my mechanism of expansion and contraction, as opposed to mechanical sliders. This allows me to pack 4000 watts of solar on a Tesla, without going over the max roof weight capacity of 165 lbs.

Overall it has been a fun project so far and I am designing Beta2. Beta1 is 11 inches high and is made out of wood. Beta2 will be fully made of carbon fiber and will be 6 inches high. Right now I researching the DC-to-DC charging and hot wiring.

Thank you all for your inspiration by sharing and discussing all things Tesla, **and of course ask me anything in the comments** and I'll reply shortly.

post,19cdzbd,,"Rented a Tesla for a week from Hertz in Orlando,FL","Hi Everyone, 

This is my first time renting a Tesla. I had the car for about 7 days and only driven the car for 561 miles and charged it at max 6 times at a supercharging station provided by Tesla. I was charged twice from Hertz (Tesla Rebuild) for $51.55 which sounds correct. Then charged $963.45 which doesn’t make any sense. I have contacted Hertz and they said the charges are correct and the bill comes directly from the Tesla super charging station. I argued this over the phone and nothing. I have called Tesla and asked what could this charge be and they told me even if you sit the car for nearly 2 hours the charge wouldn’t be that high which we never did during this trip. I have booked this through my discover card and I will be giving them a call to dispute this as well.

post,1b5o2uy,,Tesla hate is real,"After driving ICE cars that belonged to my parents or relying on public transport for the past years I decided after finishing my studies and getting a job I decided to buy my first own car. After taking into account costs + fun drive + luxury I decided an electric car would be the right option. Settled for a Tesla Model Y and am super happy. 
I obviously told my friends and family and damn  never expected such a negative reaction. 

I know there was a negative stigma around them but  literally from work, friends and family everybody was just criticizing my decision.
Instead of being happy for me or at least only mildly cricising due not having an electric car before I got comments like what a bad decision, never would buy electric, car will be worth 0 in 3 years, laughing about it being stupid, never able to take a long trip, charging on roadrips for hours with no range, etc. 

I couldn’t even argue with them and present my facts everybody just straight up was condescending and didn’t change their opinion. Yesterday another friend found out and said: „A Tesla/electric car driver will not be allowed to step into my car“ lol

Did you experience similar hate too? Really interesting that from my whole environment young or old has still such a big hate for Teslas or electric cars which I just dont understand like you dont have to like them but why hate so much when it doesn’t affect you…

comment,1b9rxzh,1b9rxzh,,"So, I'm going to be honest, this actually looks remarkably like what's shown on the [website](https://shop.tesla.com/product/cybertruck-basecamp)

I understand what their ""concept drawing"" shows, but when you look at the website, and you look at the customer images, it's basically the same thing.

Only real difference is that the outer ""rain slick"", or whatever you want to call it, appears to be darker in the customer images, and ""looser"", but that might be attributed to the fact that they put it together in the rain and don't have it all secured and such.

I feel like people are judging based off of the *concept* drawing, and not what's actually being sold through the website...

The Caliber study relates specifically to corporate reputation, where Tesla dropped by almost 30 pts in its “Trust & Like” and “Consideration” indexes over the last two years, which measure peoples’ opinion of a brand and if they’d consider buying their product.

They don’t appear to draw a direct line to Musk’s behavior, unclear if there’s a question in their survey directly about that, but it would be a pretty strange thing to have asked *before* Musk started having a higher profile and revealed his controversial political alignment. I also seriously doubt they’d have questions about any other auto executives — could you even name the president of Honda America?

Instead Caliber threads the needle by pointing out their survey does show that 83% of adults know who Musk is and that he runs Tesla.

Not an entirely unreasonable conclusion to jump to, but I’d still rate this a bad use of data.

Personally I would not consider a Tesla because I think they’re generally very good computers wrapped in a very mediocre car.

post,1ca9qkq,,Data confirms Musk's destruction of the Tesla brand: He's driving away many of his core customers,"📉 last Fall, the proportion of Democrats buying Teslas fell by more than 60%, precisely when Musk became most vocal on X

📉 the mix of Democrats, who have been core constituents for the Tesla brand, had remained mostly steady up to that point

📈 gains with Republicans and Independents haven't been enough to make up the loss

I think musk has been important for getting the ball rolling in a number of fields, but he needs to get off the internet and work on his public image. It’s not too late for him to be like “I’m going to step away from the spotlight for a moment and work on myself”, but l doubt his ego will let him.

I just had a meeting with a client so I had to drive 45 minutes each way to meetup with them.

I just confirmed the address and enabled FSD and then the car drove me the entire route with zero intervention. The route included all sorts of roads/highways/etc and it handled it flawlessly. 

If you really take a minute to think about what is happening it’s mind blowing that this is possible.

It shocks me how negative the tone is here about FSD. I live in Los Angeles where city driving can be hectic and the latest FSD v12 is a game changer.

It makes the right decisions (and drives better than I do) 99% of the time. The 1% of the time it makes the wrong decisions are usually very obvious beforehand and it's easy for me to disengage, quickly make the right decision, and fire FSD right back up.

I use it almost exclusively for every drive now and will never drive another car that doesn't offer it. Even despite monitoring the road the entire time, I am no longer making thousands of brain-fatiguing micro decisions every time I'm in the driver's seat and driving is such a pleasure.

comment,1ctjrpu,1ctjrpu,,"A few thoughts from an actual user:

  
It had a few hiccups, but it was a LOT better than I thought it would be. The few times I had to intervene were mostly because I wasn't comfortable with the situation. For example, I didn't like that it didn't seem to pay attention to semi's blind spots, and would just cruise right beside them. My longest trips was 140 miles on a not-so-busy highway and it was nearly perfect. I didn't intervene one time.

For the amount of miles my wife drives, $99 is too much for me. However, if I was going on a long road trip and planned on using a lot in a month, I would pay $99. I think for our amount of usage, $30 would be about right.

  
Everyone I know that tried it a lot, was really impressed. There were a few things that people complained about like accelerating fast at lights, which is more of a preference thing, which I actually enjoyed.

It made me hate AutoPilot even more. There is zero reason that I shouldn't be able to switch lanes without interrupting the cruise control. My Kia does lane centering, just like the Tesla, but when I turn on the signal it allows me to switch lanes without deactivating anything.",1164,False,1715887670.0,2024-05-16 21:27:50,54,0,JackfruitCrazy51,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1ctjrpu/teslas_selfdriving_tech_ditched_by_98_percent_of/l4cmv6k/,True,,2024,tesla,top,False,False,0,l4cmv6k

I used FSD and the trial reaffirmed that I will never pay for FSD unless it's $2,000 or less. To me FSD still drives too slow and skittish especially at irregular stop signs or intersections. Also city / back roads the constant changing of speed limits puts you back to the speed limit, if I'm not doing 10mph over on the city streets I'll have traffic piling up my ass behind me. Also when the speed limit goes from 35 to 45mph, most human drivers are doing 50-55mph by the time you hit the 45mph sign, so people would ride up my ass and I'd manually have to speed up early.

That said, I hold myself accountable for this and respect their choice.  This also will mark the end of my 20 years in automotive service industry.

Some ideas based on customer feedback 

DMV Test Mode- DMVs around the country are failing young drivers primary due to our exceptional one pedal driving. You could piggy back the brake burnish command with a different UI.  This would force the driver to use the pedal and then the instructors would have less to grip about. 

Drivers Ed Mode- create a program that teaches young drivers the rules of the road through a series of challenges.  In this mode the vehicle will set up routes based on the users progress through the training these routes would become more advanced. Make it into a “simulator” of sorts and they could even practice the basics while parked.  

So folks, let’s have it.  I’m still held to some NDAs but my experiences are mine.  I’ll still gladly help you when and where I can.

post,1eimxw9,,"I tracked the price of 3000 used Teslas, here is what I found","I tracked the price of used cars listed on the Tesla website for the last 4 months. In total, I tracked \~3000 cars. I focused on cars listed in the San Francisco Bay Area. I used a linear regression model to determine what factors influence the price.

**Some insights:**

* Model Y and Model 3 cars are listed for 5 days on average before being removed/sold. Model X and S take a little longer, with an average of 7 days.
* Tesla automatically lowers the price if a car does not sell. On average the price decreased by $200 per day.
* 68% of all cars have basic Autopilot, 29% have FSD, 3% come with Enhanced Autopilot.
* 99% of eligible used cars include the Acceleration Boost option.

***Pricing factor estimates by model:***

**Model 3**

*Price reducing factors*

* $97 per 1000 miles driven
* $127 for each extra month in age
* $860 when previously repaired

*Model variants:*

* $3500 for Long range ($9000 new)
* $2300 performance version (new $7000)

*Premium options:*

* $1400 for EAP
* $2600 for FSD (new $8000)
* $90 for the white interior (new $1000)

Black ($221) and gray ($150) have a better resale value, compared to red (-$142), white (-$93) and blue (-$56).

No difference was found between 18 and 19 inch wheels ($1000 new)

**Model Y**

*Price reducing factors*

* $133 per 1000 miles driven
* $239 for each extra month in age
* $1600 when previously repaired

*Model variants:*

* $5500 for AWD ($3000 new)
* $3100 performance version (new $7000)

*Premium options:*

* $1900 for EAP
* $2800 for FSD (new $8000)
* $120 for the white interior (new $1000)

Red ($341) and black ($199) have a better resale value, compared to gray (-$121), white (-$113) and blue (-$306).",2559,True,1722637034.0,2024-08-03 00:17:14,5651,385,tbyd683,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1eimxw9/i_tracked_the_price_of_3000_used_teslas_here_is/,True,0.96,2024,tesla,top,False,False,0,

post,1f7a9i7,,Stranger blown away by FSD,"So I was activating a charger in a strip mall parking lot when a gentleman approached and started asking the usual EV questions.  ""Is it free to charge, how far does it go, how many chargers are there"". Years ago, these interactions were somewhat common, but as more and more people know about EVs,  it's not anymore. So it was a pleasant surprise, and I happily answered. 

Then he asked 'is this one of those self driving ones?'.

'yep, drove me here'

'no... It didn't actually?'

'yep' ... The look on his face was pessimistic so... 'if you have a few moments, hop on and see for yourself'. 12.3.6 is good, but it certainly has issues, but whatever, let's see what this random guy thinks...

He excitedly agrees, and we get in and I enter a random waypoint and let FSD pull out of the parking stall and off we go. I proactively mentioned it can be a bit silly in parking lots, and it certainly was very slow and cautious... But the guy was too blown away to care. As FSD turned onto public roads, and as it navigated the world around it, the amazement in this guy's eyes and voice grew by the moment. 

It was maybe a 10 minute drive, in mostly residential roads, but it was perfect. I didn't have to intervene once. Stops, yields, pedestrians and bikes, a car blocking the path while it turned around, fitting through narrow gaps due to parked cars and an oncoming big truck, slowing for speed bumps... And when it returned us to the parking lot, I selected a parking stall and it parked itself. 

The guy was losing his mind. He couldn't believe the car just drove him around. He was so awe-struck, so excited. He thanked me and then noticed his buddy, who was waiting for him... As he walked off with his friend, this 30ish year old guy was talking about his experience like a giddy school boy.

Sometimes it's nice to get an outsiders perspective on FSD. Sure, it wasn't the hardest route, but it was a random, real world route... And to this guy, it was magical.",2118,True,1725292645.0,2024-09-02 17:57:25,867,159,footbag,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1f7a9i7/stranger_blown_away_by_fsd/,True,0.93,2024,tesla,top,False,False,0,

My wife absolutely fell in love with the car (It was in almost perfect condition, minus some paint chips on the front hood). We bought it, and after we drove away, I realized that the original owner had upgraded the computers and it had FSD.

We talk for a few minutes as I wait for my next ride request. His wife comes walking out and the guy excitedly recounts his FSD experience. He offered me $100 cash if I could take them for a spin around the corner quick so the wife could experience it.

post,1frg26x,,Rented a Model 3. I get why rental companies are dumping Teslas.,"Preface: I own a Model Y and I love it. Best car I've ever owned.

Had to go to Albuquerque for a short 2-day business trip. Rented a compact car from Budget. Guy asked how far I'd be driving, I said almost none, staying in airport area. He asked if he can give me a Tesla, I said sure. He told me it was a Y, but it was actually a RWD 3 with the LFP pack.

After getting in the car, ALL the settings were jacked up. Screen on Light rather than auto, headlights on rather than auto, climate manual not auto. Random safety features turned off. Autopilot set to TACC-only (although I get that). Sentry on. Bunch of other ones I forget, but I had to fix almost every setting. Luckily battery was at 98% so thats good. Unlike Hertz, Budget does not allow app connectivity, just the card.

I drove away and attended a meeting for a few hours. Came back out to the A/C humming away, I had missed the cabin overheat protection setting, it drained 10% of the battery in the hot New Mexico sun. Luckily I only used 20% of the battery my whole trip because I stayed pretty local. Car was also sort of janky: really bad wind noise/gap in driver window somewhere, and suspension felt a little rattle-y compared to my Y. Car had 21k miles. However I was impressed with the power of the RWD model. It's totally adequate, if not impressive.

Anyway, the ONLY reason I was able to navigate all this is because I own a Tesla and I know all this stuff. I cannot imagine any non-Telsa-owner being able to figure all this out and being happy with the experience. And I didn't even have to figure out how/where to charge it, that would be a whole other ball of wax for a new person. Beyond depreciation, I bet they've gotten tons of user complaints on these.

No problems. Had a couple of recall fixes, and one of the fixes they messed up the trunk seal which then leaked and needed to be repaired.

There are some rattles... annoying.

I hate the wipers.

The self drive stuff was a waste of money.  Sure it works 95%... it's the 5% that scares the living s#it out of me... and has a couple of times.  Once on autopilot on the toll way (doing 65ish), this guy passes me 2 lanes over going 100+... Tesla hard swerves away from the speeding car, then swerves back the other direction, does it beep-beep and throws out of auto-mode and says take over mid swerve.  My 16 year old boy learning to drive never scared me that much.  Sadly, i have 4 or 5 other stories like this.

Battery is still strong, tires are almost out, brakes are still fine (but I never use them).

30k miles... don't drive much.

But love everything else about the car... and still haven't found a car I like better.

comment,1g7hhm8,1g7hhm8,,"I think it’s really easy for nuance and details to get lost over text, which is part of why I don’t like everything being handled through the app. There’s a convenience factor for sure, but being there in person with a service advisor (ideally the same one each time) who can physically see the issue and keep track of things is a much better approach for situations like OP’s. 

Tesla’s advisors, from what I can tell, work from a queue and it’s often not the same person you’re interacting with from message to message or day to day (mainly in the app). I also imagine they have time-to-response metrics they’re held to in some way, so it’s super easy for context to get lost when you’re unfamiliar with the situation and jump into the message thread without reading all of the past service history and notes. 

It’s pretty inexcusable for a company of Tesla’s size to handle things this way, especially when dealing with more complex situations. It’s one thing to handle a simple tire rotation like this, but when dealing with a (fairly) complex warranty issue, there are just too opportunities for details to get lost over text. 

I’d agree that showing up in person is the way to go. I’ve always had good experiences with Tesla’s service advisors in person; so if OP has one near by, showing up in person and calmly explaining the situation would be the best place to start.

post,1gs3w77,,My Tesla with an expanding solar roof -- generates 4.5kwh per day,"Hello Reddit, this is an update of the last year worth of work on a personal project of mine -- placing an expandable solar array on my Tesla. And like all the past builds, the blueprints will be online for anyone to access. The last prototype Beta2 had lots of great feedback, and I am excited to share RC1 (Release Candidate 1). Officially the community is called [DartSolar](https://dartsolar.com) now, if you search online you can find our Reddit post from last year and all our blueprints.

https://preview.redd.it/wmzwpush541e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=08c6381084c14dc179fdd4d80426618f37c37d78

https://i.redd.it/ctxmyr9m341e1.gif

This is a 1kw solar array, composed of 6 smaller custom solar panels. These smaller solar panels are more serviceable, easier to replace, and makes it cheaper to fix. The roof rack uses custom made telescopic tubes make of aluminum (mostly), and some one segment made of stainless steel that I'm planning to replace with carbon fiber. However, when I release the blueprints I'll have the aluminum and carbon fiber specifications. You can get the blueprints of Beta2, and get these blueprints [here](https://dartsolar.com).

https://i.redd.it/aua77z4g441e1.gif

The entire design had to be aerodynamic af. I wanted no more than 2% aerodynamic drag loss. So I tested different designs on a 10-mile stretch where I would drive with the DartSolar on and off. The current model is about 1-inch tall, we created a custom made roof rack support to further decrease the height. Because the whole thing is flat we've observed 1% drag loss when driving at 30 mph, and about 2% when driving at 60 mph. In my daily commute I rarely go over 60 mph.

https://i.redd.it/77di9blfx31e1.gif

post,1gxe3oj,,Bedini SG energizer (!motor),"
Aaron murakami wrote a 3-book series on Bedini’s SG energizer. He states the machine’s output is sub 100% efficiency. The magic (which does happen) is IN the battery itself.

In essence, the goal of the motor/generator/energizer/<pick your confusing ambiguity here> is to impulse the battery. The mechanical part just adds noise to the understanding IMO. I made a PBC that generates plain impulses, originally it was a high-side bridge (for negative flyback spikes), but I adapted it for Bedini’s positive impulses.

Currently testing and can’t confirm yet the charging battery charges faster than the primary discharges. But I do see the “h” curve and a the right signals (I’d add a pic but this Reddit is limited)

The theory is that sharp impulses/energy gradients (which are aren’t that sharp once directed to the battery as it behaves as a capacitor widening the signal.) polarize (if that’s the right terminology for surrounding big ions with negative charge) the ions in the battery and they then autonomously migrate to the positive plates (i.e. not being actively pushed by current).

My PCB can run a couple Modes (high voltage impulses, capacitors discharges)
1st pic: high voltage impulses, shorted to the battery above zener BVR, (12V and 24V above secondary battery level). This causes the famous “h curve”

2nd pic: capacitor discharge mode. The h grows taller and thinner until it’s discharged violently on the battery.

3rd: pic schematic impulse PCB abstracted as a MOSFET. 

4th pic: Bedini inspired PCB, Master Ivo inspired impulse PCB, tesla coil, 12V secondary battery. 

I run both batteries with common ground and the primary biased up 6-12V, so the current that normally would be wasted to ground for charging the coil, ends up going to the secondary right before the impulse is caused.

Currently (1st and last pics) pushing secondary to avg 12.83V ; the primary steady at 18.71V ~120mA (started test +1hr ago and it marked 18.",2153,True,1732298635.0,2024-11-22 19:03:55,23,7,juanmf1,Tesla,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gxe3oj,False,0.97,2024,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

I guess this complaint was from a few months ago, and my manager refused to say anything to me, stating that our company had no policy on the matter.  I used it yesterday and was pulled into his office today.  He again stated that he asked them about a policy, because this will become more common in the future and we need to have a policy (especially since there's another Tesla here now).

post,1hlfzcy,,Thanks for the Superchargers!,"Recently charged my 2020 Chevy Bolt Premier at a supercharger near me. Just wanted to test the GM NACS adapter with Betty B(olt).

Went well. 

This will substantially decrease range anxiety the next time we take a longer trip. 

The Tesla owners next to me were very nice and smiled as I connected to the charger.

comment,1hlfzcy,1hlfzcy,,"Not as fast as a Tesla. But in this place, there were 8 chargers. One used by me and the other by the Tesla. I was just testing the adapter. It was pretty cold - I was only getting 19 kwh charge rate. but after 20 minutes I disconnected, (got close to 30 miles of range added) since I live 3 miles from here and can charge in my garage. Level 1 for now. Going to to get a level 2 charger next year.  I am aware of the the etiquette of taking up a space if another Tesla needs a fast charge. But when there are plenty of spaces, no need for me to do this. I used the Tesla app, since the My Chevy app is a bit wonky. 

If I were at 20% SOC, it would probably take 45-50 minutes to get to 80% - which the Supercharger limits me to, btw.

comment,1hpsc0u,1hpsc0u,,"Plutocrats like Elon Musk (not a U.S. Service Veteran) want cheap labor they can exploit. Contrary to the ""DOGE"" narrative, the fact is there is currently an oversupply of high-quality domestic tech labor as the U.S. has experienced [major technology layoffs in 2024](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/tech-news/the-state-of-tech-layoffs-in-2024-a-closer-look-at-major-cuts-and-industry-trends#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20the%20tech%20industry%20will%20undergo%20massive,these%20cuts%2C%20as%20are%20hundreds%20of%20smaller%20startups.).

The H-1B visa gives an employer complete control over the employee. If the employee loses the job, they lose their visa and are sent back to their home country. This is why the plutocrats want the H-1B visas. In the program employees can be coerced into working 100-hour weeks for below average pay.

Tellingly, Elon Musk runs Tesla as a nonunion shop in the United States. Musk also has ongoing well-publicized disputes with the unions in Germany and Sweden. Musk's just a less interesting version of the 19th century robber barons who hired Pinkertons to fire upon the rank-and-file.

comment,1hq6gib,1hq6gib,,"There's a few factors at play here.

1) the median age of vehicles on the road in the US is over 12 years. Half of then are therefore pretty close to several decades old and in various states of repair.

2) accident rate increases with the age of the vehicle. Older vehicles are therefore over-represented in calls for service by first responders.

3) Older vehicles on average are less safe before you even factor in any age related degradation.


The result is something of a bias that doesn't necessarily reflect the reality of cars built in the last few years. The Model Y has a very strong roof structure. Ioniq 5's roof strength tested within 5% of the Y. Both are demonstrably very safe vehicles.

There is an impact of vehicle geometry to consider though as well. Ioniq 5 has a much closer to vertical rear gate/window which may have resulted in more of a rear collision rather than one that skidded up the Y and landed on the roof. That could be no big deal or it could be worse. There's not really a way for us to know. Oddly enough IIHS does not do any rear impact testing.

Tldr; Modern cars, especially EVs, are all quite safe. Different cars behave differently though so there's no way to really know which is better for a specific accident.",1255,False,1735653908.0,2024-12-31 15:05:08,13,0,zackplanet42,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1hq6gib/the_glass_roof_is_no_joke_a_truck_rear_ended_a/m4oy7xs/,True,,2024,tesla,top,False,False,0,m4oy7xs

post,1i362wr,,Do not push it - it’s winter,"Here we go. It finally happened to me and I thought it wouldn’t. In my 2020 MYLR took trip to NJ on an overnight stay. I left at 100% and arrived around 20%. After a long workday, I went straight to the hotel and arrived with about 6% left. After checking for food spots and Superchargers in the area, I thought it may be a good idea to get a little charge before heading into the office the next day. 

Looking at the superchargers, I saw they had a cheaper rate after midnight (around .20c) which is far cheaper than .45c during that peak dinner time. 

My logic led me to believe, charge at a ChargePoint while grabbing a bite just to get out of the low power state until midnight. 

With hot fresh food in hand, I was prepared for a Netflix and grub in the ride after selecting a ChargePoint location 6 miles away. The mood changed when I arrived to the ChargePoint location and the area is gated and marked for Employees only. I buzzed the gate, spoke to security and expressed my demise as I stared at a 2% state of charge and temperatures are in the low 20F. Security ensured the local Wegmans had a charger that I can use, as I made my way to Wegmans, I see a Hotel with charging stations available.. 

I made a quick turn and plugged in and received the check host error. At this point, we’re at 1%. While I walked to the front desk to explain myself. I passed a vacant Blink station which showed the 800 number for support. Somehow, I thought this would finally free me from the series of obscure stupidity. I plugged in, made the call and quickly learned the host (Hotel) needs to approve the charge as this is a private charge. 

I quickly unplug and neatly return the cable to its original position and make my way to Wegmans because you know, the security guard assured me. Upon my arrival, there is no charging option available and I park and search for the nearest Tesla Superchargers.",3065,True,1737080585.0,2025-01-17 03:23:05,779,135,Clear_Writing_2424,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1i362wr/do_not_push_it_its_winter/,True,0.95,2025,tesla,top,False,False,0,

What should have happened is that it should be an API that charge vendors and vehicle manufacturers feed data in/out behind the scenes.  What chargers are in use, how much it costs to use, what chargers are broken (to a certain extent since this is better with crowd sourcing) should be all automated when a vehicle is plugged in. 

Crowdsourcing works in some cases (ie Google Maps) but in a case like this where it's voluntary all you really get is junk data in the vast majority of cases.  

Chargers shouldn't need reviews. They should just work. There should be a reporting function that informs the charge vendor it's offline and that's about it.

I will not be caught dead in a Tesla and its Nazi owner.  His behavior is disgusting and his hatred of minorities is on par with some of the worst in history.

What do you think it takes to get a fab running? A couple years, concrete, some low skill workers, and the requisite machines manufactured by ASML in the Netherlands? You would be thoroughly wrong if you said yes to that second question. First, just designing the building needs to take into account the need for near perfect operating conditions for the clean rooms and the other various environments necessary to produce chips from silicon wafers. If expedited, this could destroy entire batches of chips due to mild changes in weather or seismic activity, if not bring down the entire facility for an extended period of time. So that work needs to be perfect. You will note a running theme here that every single aspect of these facilities need to be effectively perfect for them to work. They are producing incredibly complex structures on the order of NANOMETERS. That requires unfathomable precision, which in turn requires eternally, completely stable operating conditions. Taking into account American sign-off processes from a bureaucratic standpoint, and the fact that American construction routinely cuts corners, TSMC would need to constantly oversee their entire building process and additionally lube the gears of the federal and local government to make this process work.",4501,True,1738073186.0,2025-01-28 15:06:26,27,0,homelessness_is_evil,investing,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ic0kp2/trump_announces_chip_tariffs_up_to_100/m9my7gb/,True,,2025,tesla,top,False,False,0,m9my7gb

post,1ie1jty,,Finally did it. Out with the Tesla.,"
Hey Everyone,

I have been a Tesla model y driver the last three years. My lease was up and due to recent developments with Elon and the staleness of having a Tesla (including a model 3 before) for the last 5 years; it was time for a change. 

Last night I made the jump and signed a lease of a 2024 Equinox EV 2RS all black. My lease isn’t up for a month and I just went to look and test drive anyway. I drove it and was blown away. It feels remarkably similar to my Dual Motor model Y but the interior quality was better. Loved every bit of it. It even has super cruise. The only option it’s lacking that I wish it had is the panoramic sunroof. 

I feel like I got a great deal (I negotiated pretty hard). 24 month lease with $315 per month lease with $0 down, 10,000 miles. All in all, spending $120 less per month than my Tesla. Very happy!

post,1ifna8h,,Canada will retaliate with 25% tariffs on US imports and limit export of rare minerals as response to Trump tariffs! Trade war is on!,"Canada is imposing it’s own 25 per cent tariffs on $155 billion worth of U.S. goods after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped Canada with 25 per cent tariffs on all goods and 10 per cent tariffs on oil, natural gas and electricity.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the tariffs will take effect on $30 billion worth of goods starting Tuesday with a further $125 billion worth of products being taxed 21 days later.

Trudeau elected to go ahead with retaliatory tariffs even though Trump’s order includes a mechanism to escalate the rates if Canada retaliates against the U.S.

Canada will also look at how to limit export of rare minerals to the US which are crucial for US tech and car companies like Tesla.

Moreover, the presumptive front runner, Mark Carney, has indicated that moving back to ""strong incentives"" for pro-climate purchases is the path he'll take. This may include the re-introduction of a very strong EV purchase credit now that the existing program has run its course.

post,1iqncw1,,RDUS - Radius Recycling,"Radius Recycling - RDUS  
  
Market cap $370  
Tangible Book of $540 million  
EV of $940 million  
Net debt $400 million with $160 million of operating lease liabilities

TTM operating loss of $83 million. 2021-2022 operating income was circa $200 million annually.

P/Book of 0.68.

Estimate of fair value: **0.9-1X tangible book, with further upside if profitability can get to 2018 or 2021-2022 levels.**

**20-50% upside, possibly 70%+ if profitability gets close to 2018 or 2021-2022 levels**

Radius Recycling is a metal scrapper based in Portland, Oregon, but with scrapping locations in California, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia, and Alabama. The two biggest products are ""ferrous scrap"" and ""non-ferrous scrap"" which are metallic scrap processed/recycled from junk - think old cars, railway cars, etc.

Ferrous scrap was $370 million in revenue, 56% of Fiscal Q1 2025 revenue of $660 million. The division produced 1.1 million tons of ferrous scrap priced at $338/ton in Q1 2025. Ferrous scrap can be fed into electric arc furnaces (like those at Nucor NUE or Steel Dynamics STLD) to make new steel.

Non-ferrous scrap produced $180 million in revenue, 27% of Q1 2025 revenue. Non-ferrous scrap is dominated by aluminum and copper scrap, so prices mainly off of aluminum and copper pricing.

The company has also done some vertical integration, and it built its own electric arc furnace steel mill, which can process the company's own scrap. RDUS own EAF produced 125,000 tons of steel, sold at $771 per ton last quarter, for $97 million in revenue, or 15% of total revenue.

The company had a surge of profitability in 2022 during the strong pricing environment, but if you look over its history, it has been a boom and bust cyclical. It did very well in the pre-2008 industrial metals bull market, and has struggled to make consistent profits since, occasionally doing well like in 2017-2018, then a weak 2019-2020, then a strong 2021-2022, and now an abysmal 2023-2024 cycle.",8255,True,1739692455.0,2025-02-16 08:54:15,20,0,jackandjillonthehill,SecurityAnalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1iqncw1/rdus_radius_recycling/,True,0.92,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

comment,1j5z8gn,1j5z8gn,,"More than 200 auto dealers across the country were “stiffed” when Tesla “had a run on the bank,” claiming tens of millions of dollars in EV rebates on the last weekend before the government abruptly shut down the public subsidy program in January.

Now these independently owned dealerships are out of pocket an estimated $10 million, having provided 2,295 rebates to customers and expecting to get reimbursed, according to the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association (CADA).

“These dealers in good faith gave customers the money for a program that is always refunded,” said CADA spokesperson Huw Williams. “They shouldn’t be left making a payment on behalf of the Government of Canada.”

The iZEV EV rebate program offered from $2,500 to $5,000 toward the purchase of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. Dealerships provided the rebate to buyers upfront and expected to be reimbursed by the government.

On Jan. 10, as political turmoil embroiled the federal government, Transport Canada informed dealerships that the EV rebate program would run out of money before its scheduled end in March.

“Due to the high uptake, the iZEV Program will be paused in a few weeks,” stated the email sent to dealerships just before noon on the Friday, obtained by the Star.

But that weekend there was an unprecedented surge in claims from four Tesla outlets, the Star revealed this week. The four Tesla showrooms claimed 8,653 EV sales in 72 hours and filed for $43.",3552,True,1741383519.0,2025-03-07 22:38:39,548,0,FourteenthCylon,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j5z8gn/suspicious_tesla_sales_surge_triggers_canadian/mgkxj49/,True,,2025,both,top,False,False,0,mgkxj49
comment,1j5z8gn,1j5z8gn,,"CADA surveyed its 3,500 dealer members to determine how many rebated EVs were sold that didn’t get inputted into the system before the federal government shut it down. Their numbers, which have not been made public, show 226 dealerships provided rebates on 2,295 electric vehicles and have not been reimbursed. This would total more than $10 million, if the breakdown of battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles mirrored all the rebates given out since 2019. 

Williams said one dealership is out of pocket $690,000. The Star spoke with two dealers in Quebec; both pointed out that most Quebec auto dealers are closed on the weekend and therefore were not only unable to sell EVs during the last weekend the rebate program was open, but also weren’t able to file paperwork when they returned to work on the Monday. One of the dealers said he was out $300,000. The other said he had fronted $410,000, and is considering layoffs because of the financial squeeze. 

Terry Budd, who owns eight car dealerships in the Oakville and Hamilton areas, said there was no notice from the government that the iZEV program was coming to an end. Instead, he received an email from CADA informing him the program was running short on funds and advising him to tell his salespeople and customers.

While they hurried to get as many rebates submitted as possible over the weekend, more than a month later, they still haven’t been paid for the 35 EVs and hybrids they sold that weekend.",1961,True,1741383539.0,2025-03-07 22:38:59,181,0,FourteenthCylon,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j5z8gn/suspicious_tesla_sales_surge_triggers_canadian/mgkxlhe/,True,,2025,tesla,top,False,False,0,mgkxlhe

post,1j7l0bv,,TSLA being investigated by Transport Canada for cooking their books in Canada to snag EV rebates without selling cars.,"The article notes that **four Tesla dealerships claimed to have sold 8,653 Teslas in 3 days.** Assuming each dealership opens from 9AM-5PM, that's **90 cars sold per hour per dealership**. Worth noting that Canada's EV rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how Tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did...

Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M.

I guess that's one way to maintain revenue while sales drop 90%!

Note: investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation of official wrongdoing yet.

Edit: Since this post got more attention then I expected. Yes I posted this Sunday and TSLA is currently down 13% today. However I do not think this is causing the drop, and rather it’s an overall market pull back from trade wars and from Europe sales declines. The article was published Friday morning and Tesla was up 3% by end of Friday.

comment,1j9jxzj,1j9jxzj,,"So there's two aspects to this:

The first is that all companies are run by people, and it's a completely natural and right that the people in charge of other EV companies would be horrified by Musk and his antics. The proper human response to nascent fascism is revulsion and opposition.

The second though is that companies get anthromorphized by consumers/audiences so that people see communications from that company (like ads and brand-managed social media posts) as coming from a *person*, rather than a company. People can have very personal responses to this - and interestingly, there is a large segment of the human population that is conflict-adverse over all else. Getting involved in a fight, *even if the cause is righteous* is seen as being ""just as bad"" as fighting for an evil cause. It is the *fight* that is wrong, irrespective of the root cause of the fight. 

So there is significant risk of alienating a large portion of your customer base with potential spillover to sales - and as the role of a company is always to make money, there is risk that standing up for what's right will see you punished financially.

This is the heart of ""Go woke, go broke"" (although that phrase is intended to be a threat; it isn't an axiom).

post,1jc7cr3,,From two Tesla's to none.,"Had two Model Y's but didn't want to keep them and they were depreciating before our eyes as we checked the prices so bit the bullet and swapped out both. Had varying amounts of equity in the cars but got what we could that would match our realistic needs. Bittersweet but one less thing we needed to think about! 

Aside - Used bolts are crazy cheap! Kinda plasticy but for the 2 mile commute it works.

Ioniq 6 is super long! Bolt is not pulled in all the way else it would really show. Was able to get a 2023 with only 1700 miles which is crazy, but while the rated range is 270 vs 310 on the Y, in the 80 mile drive to the dealer and then back the Ioniq used less of the battery percentage. Some variability in the drives but at least a very close match.

I considered the Ioniq 5, EV9, F150 Lightning, Polestar 3, Mach E, Mercedes EQS.

I was looking for something similar to Tesla. I mainly wanted the regen and software to be similar. And from a Tesla owners perspective, the Rivian is very similar, which is great! The regen is even stronger and adjustable.

Some of the other EVs DEFAULT to no regen or low regen. And they never remember your regen settings when you get in, you have to hit the paddles every time! I'm looking at you Kia and Hyundai!

I was not a fan of the software for the F150, Mach E or Mercedes. The layout of the Rivian infotainment is akin to modern tablet OS and has a native spotify app like Tesla. I can even google cast to it, which could arguably be easier than the native youtube app on Tesla. I can cast crunchyroll animes!

comment,1je8ms2,1je8ms2,,"“Tesla investors are having another rocky day, with shares down as much as 7%.

The stock is headed for an ninth-straight weekly loss, and now sits 53% below the all-time highs reached in mid-December.

As each day passes, the list of headwinds facing the EV maker seems to grow. In addition to existing pressures, Tesla on Tuesday faced fresh competition from China and an analyst price-target cut.

Below are four forces — two new, two evergreen — driving the acceleration in Tesla’s share-price decline.

1. BYD’s new battery tech

The Chinese firm BYD unveiled an EV-charging station that it claims can deliver up to 400 kilometers driving range after just five minutes of charging. This would be a big step up from current charging technology, with Tesla’s quickest version providing a 275-kilometer range after 15 minutes of charging.

The development creates another headwind for Tesla as it tries to break into Chinese market.

BYD plans to build 4,000 of these chargers across China.

2. Wall Street scaling back forecasts

Though RBC maintains an “outperform” rating on Tesla, it cut its price target to $320 from $440.

The analyst Tom Narayan expects lower pricing on Tesla’s full self-driving technology as autonomous offerings become increasingly standard across the EV industry. Meanwhile, given heightened competition in Europe and China, Narayan lowered robotaxi-penetration assumptions.",3126,True,1742315284.0,2025-03-18 17:28:04,85,0,TheWelshleyArms,business,https://reddit.com/r/business/comments/1je8ms2/4_reasons_why_teslas_53_stock_crash_is/migliis/,True,,2025,both,top,False,False,0,migliis

post,1jfn3wn,,Tesla (TSLA) accounting raises red flags as report shows $1.4 billion missing,"“Tesla’s (TSLA) accounting practices are raising red flags as a new report from the Financial Times shows that $1.4 billion is missing.
Many Tesla shorts and detractors have questioned Tesla’s accounting for years, but they have never gained much traction – until now.
Today, the Financial Times has released a new report pointing to a $1.4 billion gap in assets:

**Compare Tesla’s capital expenditure in the last six months of 2024 to its valuation of the assets that money was spent on, and $1.4bn appears to have gone astray**.”

post,1jfwaaf,,"Farewell Tesla, Hello Lucid 👋","My first EV—a marvel of engineering. When I bought it in late 2023, I acknowledged Elon’s presence but justified the purchase, knowing the world isn’t just black and white.

But over the past few months, something shifted. Call it a growing discomfort, or for lack of a better word, the ick.

The final straw? The Rose Garden shoot. A week later, as I sat at a red light, it hit me—I simply couldn’t drive this car anymore, no matter how impressive it was.

And so, today, I say goodbye. I won’t be buying a Tesla again. For those curious, Carvana was about 2K more than Lucid trade in offer and Carmax/KBB. Still sold at a loss, yes, I realize my privilege saying that. Lucid is now offering a 2K Tesla Trade-In bonus on select states that makes it more compelling even if the Carvana price is better but I just went for the simplicity of trading in with them.

If anyone is curious what the situation of Tesla is like, just go to Carvana and look at the sheer number of cars with under 10K mileage for sale. Astounding.

comment,1jfw22y,1jfw22y,,"Rivian delivered 51,579 vehicles in 2024. 13,423 were RDVs, so 38,156 R1T and R1S, but mostly R1S. That's 9,539 a quarter on average. 2023 had largely similar numbers (50k total), 2022 had 25k total deliveries. That's somewhere around 90k making some SWAGs about RDVs since it's generally hard to figure out. The biggest problem with all of this is there's several R1Ss sold for every R1T.

Ford sold 33,510 lightnings in 2024 or 8,377 a quarter. Add 2022 (15.6k) and 2023 (24k) sales and about 73k lightnings have been sold on an upward trend.

TL;DR: There are more R1 vehicles than cybertrucks but more cybertrucks than R1Ts. Lightnings appear to generally be the best selling EV truck. Cybertrucks briefly outsold everyone, peaking at a rate of 15k a quarter for at least a month but that seems to have ended.

ETA: using the 1:3 ratio of R1S:R1T from the report linked by SPorterBridges, that's roughly 31k R1Ts, probably the 46k cybertrucks from the recall and. 73k lightnings, and 126k total R1 vehicles.

[Elon Musk:] Well, there are a lot of these Teslas driving around the world all the time, and very seldom does anything like this happen … I just don’t want people thinking that Teslas aren’t safe.

[Interviewer:] Was this Tesla safe?

[Elon Musk:] Well I was thinking more about the other ones.

[Elon Musk:] Yeah. The ones the front doesn’t fall off.

[Interviewer:] Well, if this wasn’t safe, why was it towing other Teslas to the White House for a sales pitch?

[Elon Musk:] Well, I’m not saying it wasn’t safe, it’s just perhaps not quite as safe as some of the other ones.

[Elon Musk:] Well, some of them are built so the front doesn’t fall off at all.

[Interviewer:] Wasn’t this built so the front wouldn’t fall off?

[Elon Musk:] Well, ‘cause the front fell off, and two more Teslas it was towing spilled onto the road and caught fire when their lithium batteries got punctured. It’s a bit of a give-away. I would just like to make the point that that is not normal.

#Trump’s Aggression Sours Europe on US Cloud Giants

###Companies in the EU are starting to look for ways to ditch Amazon, Google, and Microsoft cloud services amid fears of rising security risks from the US. But cutting ties won’t be easy.

> The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti–Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.

> There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies’ cloud services—including servers, storage, and databases—citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.

> “There’s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,” says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.

> The moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become “more technologically independent” and saying the status quo creates “security and reliability risks.",8585,True,1742802557.0,2025-03-24 08:49:17,10136,641,YourFuture2000,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jilfwg/companies_in_the_eu_are_starting_to_look_for_ways/,True,0.97,2025,both,top,False,False,0,

""Canada has frozen $43 million in payments to Tesla pending a line-by-line investigation into its last-minute surge in EV rebate claims made on the final weekend of the government program.

The American EV maker run by U.S. presidential adviser Elon Musk will also be excluded from all future EV rebate programs as long as tariffs are in place, former transport minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement.

The stop-payment order appears to have been made before the current election was called Sunday, though Freeland only confirmed it Tuesday, while on the campaign trail for her University—Rosedale seat.

“As soon as I became Transport Minister, I asked the department to stop all payments for Tesla vehicles in order to fully examine each claim individually and determine whether all are eligible and valid. No payments will be made until we are confident that the claims are valid,” she said in a statement texted to the Star.

“I also directed my department to change the eligibility criteria for future iZEV programs to ensure that Tesla vehicles will not be eligible for incentive programs so long as the illegitimate and illegal U.S. tariffs are imposed against Canada.”""

The decision was confirmed by Chrystia Freeland, who was recently appointed as Transport Minister. According to Freeland, the freeze was ordered before the election was called, and payments will remain suspended until every claim submitted by Tesla is reviewed individually.

“No payments will be made until we are confident that the claims are valid,” said Freeland in a statement to the Tornoto Star. “I also directed my department to change the eligibility criteria for future iZEV programs to ensure that Tesla vehicles will not be eligible for incentives so long as the illegitimate and illegal U.S. tariffs are imposed against Canada.”

The move comes in response to a last-minute surge in rebate claims submitted by Tesla in the final days of the iZEV program.

Tesla is not a traditional dealership, in that they operate their own stores.  This could be something as simple as ""Tesla had a paperwork backlog and funneled everything through this one store"" or it can be Tesla straight up abusing the rebate system.

And in that time, Elon made the engineering challenge around FSD substantially more difficult with the decision to remove radar. All so they could navigate sensor shortages and still make deliveries.

comment,1jlzajs,1jlzajs,,"I’m convinced they take away the option to minimize lane changes just so they can collect more data. Seems like everyone I talk to would set it to minimal lane changes if given the option.

For me, I absolutely despise the fact that if I want to go faster, I have to change the behavior to standard or hurry, but then it makes more lane changes. All I want, and probably most everyone, is the ability to have the card drive faster while still keeping lane changes minimal. On top of that, there are times I wanted to stay in the left lane or the right lane, but it will constantly make changes to stay out of those lanes, which is infuriating. No matter how good it gets, we will also have preferences on where we want to be. 

Aside from all that, my commute has one toll I want to take and several I don’t want to take and I’m not able to do this without turning FSD on and off or stop navigating to a certain destination.

post,1jq4hf3,,US Senate passed bill by slim margin in a 51-48 vote to block Trump's tariffs on imports from Canada,"4 Republicans cross the floor to vote with Democrats to pass a bill that would remove import tariffs on Canadian goods.

This still needs to pass the house (which has republican majority), and even if it passes the house, president can still veto. At which point it goes back to the senate and 2/3 need to vote to overturn the veto.

Low chance, but indication that dissent is happening within party lines given the economic downturn of tariff policy.

Interesting to see how many more house reps and senators break from party lines after today's ""liberation"" tariffs have time to impact markets and consumer prices

post,1jqyy5b,,US Equities lost 90%-and took 25 years to recover.,"Everyone is saying ""dip dip dip"" as if we are experiencing an overreaction to a small segment bubble. 

95 years ago the US levied the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, worldwide tariffs that were designed to encourage domestic production and punish ""cheating countries"". This kicked off a trade war that had no small part in causing a world-wide depression. 

The US has not levied global tariffs of this degree since then. Until yesterday.

What happened to US equities?  After a roaring bull run during which wealth was printed and the every-day man flung money in the market it crashed. But not overnight. In fits and starts the DJI lost 90% of its value over a 3 year period. 

It took *25* years for it to return to an ATH. 

Trump has fired 10s of thousands of federal employees. He's spiking unemployment. He's taxing imports to the tune of 50-100%. Other countries will do the same to us. Our companies will start having mass layoffs, crushing economic activity and investment. Domestic production will not return, everyone one will be out of money to buy stuff anyways. The SH tariffs did nothing to encourage domestic manufacturing, it just made everyone poorer. 

Maybe our monetary policy will prevent a Great Depression and we escape with ""only"" 8-10 percent unemployment, mild stagflation and the market takes 3-5 years to recover after a 50% fall.
 
I'd love to hear the thesis of *why* the market will recover or be higher in the next 12-24 months when we have a historical model staring us in the face.

the global market (and regulation too) is far past the point of a great depression happening. while the US is doing it's best to outright gut everything in regulation, in 1930s america there was practically no social net, no digital economy, no FDIC, not even fucking social security lmfao. that is why the smoot-hawley furthered the depression into unimaginable levels.

comment,1jqyy5b,1jqyy5b,,">All these companies are going to see their share of business done outside the United States plummet

I do wonder about this. For the most part, anyone outside the US doing business with Apple and Google and Microsoft aren't trading with those companies' US entities; they're contracting with legal entities in Ireland or elsewhere. There is no part of an iPhone that is made in the US except the IP, and that can be transfer priced in very creative ways. AWS and Microsoft have data centres all over the world. Everything NVIDIA makes is physically produced in Taiwan. And Teslas sold in Australia (rapid sales volume drop notwithstanding) are built in China. 

These companies (except maybe Tesla) aren't stupid. None of them are going to want to go down with the ship, and they will find ways to protect their interests. And customers are mostly rational too: Unless Tim Cook starts doing Musk salutes nobody is setting their iPhone on fire.

comment,1jtlvn7,1jtlvn7,,"From the article: Tesla has made a significant update to its Safety Score, removing one of the most controversial metrics – Forward Collision Warnings (FCW)- from the system’s formula. The removal of FCW comes as the company is dealing with a potential class action lawsuit claiming the metric artificially inflated insurance premiums.

Tesla first introduced its Safety Score system to Tesla Insurance in 2021. The system uses real-time driving telemetry to determine scores for several metrics, such as Hard Braking, Aggressive Turning, and more, all of which combine into one overall Safety Score. This score is then used to determine your monthly Tesla Insurance premiums. If you have a good, or high, Safety Score you get a lower insurance premium than someone who has a low Safety Score.

There was one metric that was particularly controversial, and that was FCW. According to Tesla, FCWs were triggered “in events where a possible collision due to an object in front of the vehicle is considered likely without driver intervention.” However, ask any Tesla owner and they will say the FCW system is far from perfect, often giving out false positives when there was no real danger of a collision.

It was enough of a problem that one owner from Illinois filed a potential class action lawsuit against the company, claiming customers were being overcharged on their monthly insurance premiums based on these false warnings.",1738,True,1744034353.0,2025-04-07 15:59:13,83,0,chrisdh79,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1jtlvn7/tesla_removes_forward_collision_warnings_from/mlv432s/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mlv432s

comment,1jtlvn7,1jtlvn7,,"Good, FCW is worthless for this purpose. Don't get me wrong, as a safety feature it's great, and it SHOULD be generally over-protective.

But if you use it to determine premiums, it has to be near-perfect, and arguably it should err towards false negative rather than false positives, which is what it does today.

In our neighborhood, there are a few lazily-curving streets with parallel parking, and even taking it at/below the 15-25mph speed limit, each day we get 4-5 FCW panic beeps from the Model X as it reliably mistakes a parked car on the side of the road for one it thinks we are going to hit, even though that car is clearly off the projected path.

comment,1jtv8dx,1jtv8dx,,"That's incorrect. The accident rate while manually driving is actually much higher than the accident rate while using FSD. Why? Because not only has FSD itself become a much more competent driver over time, but also because you can intervene when necessary, and it effectively becomes like having two sets of eyes and brains driving at the same time, where one can catch the other's mistakes. So if you were truly concerned about your life and other people's lives, you'd want to be using FSD. It is factually safer than manually driving.

Also, you're acting as if you must fully rely on FSD. No, you can take over. Eventually it will be good enough where you can fully rely on it, but we're not there yet.

We can be more proactive on removing the ones that have less 'news'.

post,1jyagqg,,TSM: My Highest Conviction Buy — Despite the Tariff and China Risk,"Hi all, 

I have been following TSMC for years, and it is my highest conviction buy...even in the tariff situation. TSMC has a technical monopoly on the most advanced chips in the world. TSMC has pricing power, and the demand for those chips will explode, driven by the increased demand for AI, cloud services and EV adoption. 

I value the shares at $338, more than double the current price. The opportunity exists because the market is discounting the stock price to account for the China and tariffs risks. The market thinks China taking over Taiwan is a real risk. I believe that the risk is overblown as the US won’t allow China to conquer Taiwan.

Any thoughts?

post,1jyghal,,Tariffs are back on Trump says!,"**Trump on Truth Social**: NOBODY is getting “off the hook” for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst! There was no Tariff “exception” announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff “bucket.” The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER! The Golden Age of America, which includes the upcoming Tax and Regulation Cuts, a substantial amount of which was just approved by the House and Senate, will mean more and better paying Jobs, making products in our Nation, and treating other Countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us. The bottom line is that our Country will be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

This is why you don't believe any news over the weekend unless Trump or the White House covers on it. Tariffs are back on now!

comment,1jz3t3i,1jz3t3i,,"That’s a fair question, but they actually use very different approaches.

Waymo is built around pre-existing, highly detailed map knowledge and localizes itself within that map to execute driving decisions. Tesla FSD is designed to dynamically perceive and respond to the environment without relying on prior mapping.

This difference directly impacts generalization.

* With a system based on pre-mapped environments, deployment becomes slow and expensive because every operational area needs to be mapped, validated, and continuously revalidated.
* A system that dynamically perceives and adapts can theoretically scale indefinitely, which is why FSD has already been deployed broadly, including its expansion into China.

There are pros and cons to each approach:

* Pre-existing map knowledge can provide very strong performance initially within its operational domain.
* Dynamic perception is harder to perfect but ultimately more flexible and scalable.

So while legal and policy constraints do affect Waymo, it’s likely not the only reason they are limited to specific areas. Their core technical approach inherently makes large-scale generalization and rapid deployment much harder.",1190,False,1744668283.0,2025-04-15 00:04:43,3,0,standardphysics,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1jz3t3i/tesla_rt_elonmusk_for_the_first_time_there_will/mn4wqxc/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mn4wqxc

Tire wear will not be inaccurate by a factor of 2.

They also claim that their normal daily drive distance suddenly spiked from 55 miles per day up to like 75 as their warranty was approaching its end.

The claim isn't ""oh noes it's not a physically measured odometer!"". The claim is that it is deliberately inaccurate. If that's true, it could end up being a huge lawsuit.

post,1k1p0mo,,"Tesla speeds up odometers to avoid warranty repairs, US lawsuit claims","[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-speeds-odometers-avoid-warranty-213536596.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-speeds-odometers-avoid-warranty-213536596.html)

(Reuters) - Tesla faces a proposed class action claiming it speeds up odometers on its electric vehicles so they fall out of warranty faster, saving Elon Musk's company from having to pay for repairs.

The plaintiff Nyree Hinton alleged that Tesla odometer readings reflect energy consumption, driver behavior and ""predictive algorithms"" rather than actual mileage driven.

He said the odometer on the 2020 Model Y he bought in December 2022 with 36,772 miles on the clock ran at least 15% fast, based on his other vehicles and driving history, and for a while said he drove 72 miles a day when at most he drove 20.

Hinton, a Los Angeles resident, said this caused his 50,000-mile basic warranty to expire well ahead of schedule, leaving him with a $10,000 suspension repair bill that he thought Tesla should cover.

""By tying warranty limits and lease mileage caps to inflated 'odometer' readings, Tesla increases repair revenue, reduces warranty obligations, and compels consumers to purchase extended warranties prematurely,"" the complaint said.

Tesla and its lawyer did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment, but have denied all material allegations in the lawsuit. The Austin, Texas-based company does not have a media relations office.

Hinton is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for Tesla drivers in California, potentially encompassing more than 1 million vehicles, court papers show.

Tesla moved his lawsuit this month to Los Angeles federal court from a state court in that city.

In March 2024, a federal judge in Oakland, California said drivers in that case must pursue their claims in individual arbitrations, not a class action.

In fact in a lot of states, you have to write down the mileage on the odometer when you sell the car. If the original odometer breaks, you have to include its last reading. If it rolls over (more common for that period of time American made cars had odometers that only went 5 digits), have to include that. Not to mention mileage is recorded by corporations and self employed people as part of business expenses. Even accuracy is regulated and they need to be within 5-10% of actual without the manufacturer getting in serious trouble. 

Actively tampering with the odometer?

post,1k5g9yj,,Tesla reports disappointing quarterly results as automotive revenue plunges 20%,"Tesla reported a miss on the top and bottom lines in its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday as automotive revenue plunged 20% from a year earlier.

Here are the key numbers compared with LSEG expectations.

* **Earnings per share**: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated
* **Revenue**: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

It’s been a brutal start to the year for Tesla, with CEO Elon Musk spending much of his time in President Donald Trump’s White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. The president’s sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment, automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells.

Tesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday.

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

In its shareholder deck, Tesla cautioned investors that “uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers.",3889,True,1745352789.0,2025-04-22 22:13:09,13942,974,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k5g9yj/tesla_reports_disappointing_quarterly_results_as/,True,0.96,2025,both,top,False,False,0,

As we all know, their stock performance is often decoupled from results. Little movement in futures so far, but curious how it’ll move tomorrow.

Waymo says their fleet has driven 25 million miles.  

Tesla has driven zero autonomous miles at SAE Level 3/4.

Look.  I'm a tesla fan.  I've personally owned three teslas.  Thanks to me, my sister, brother-in-law, father all have teslas.  I'm still invested long in the company.  I'm closer to the company than most people you will ever meet.

But objectively speaking, Waymo is currently driving autonomously, while Tesla is not.

All of this stuff about ""scalability"" is just a momentary distraction.  Sure, tesla has shown they can build factories, and pump out vehicles at scale.  But how many Cybercabs have been mass produced to date?

Maybe the calculus changes in two or three years.

And yes, they do not normalize for highway driving, which would massively distort these numbers. Absent that, this is (and always has been) cherry-picked data.

EDIT; very roughly, the data for CA divided highway and freeway for 2022 is around 1.5 million miles per accident (all types, coincidentally 
around the same as Tesla's crash rate without Autopilot), so I fully believe a Tesla on autopilot on the same roads would beat that! But that's not what these stats show.

post,1kbesxa,,I talked with a Chinese factory owner to see what’s happening on the ground. TL;DR: China has mobilized tons of resources to exporters but there’s some signs of pain,"I’m an American in China but have been seeing very little foreign reporting about what’s happening in China, which is weird to me because it seems pretty important to get a clear picture of the trade war. So here’s what I learned from him.

**Gov support**

-The local government is helping and giving him low interest rate loans / short term financial support. This type of thing is very common throughout China right now - lots of local govs are mobilizing to support exporters thru the tariff war. Li Qiang, central gov minister, says central government help is probably coming too 

-Guangzhou, and I assume others too, has also organized tons of seminars since Liberation Day with buyers from Europe, Latin America, and Asia. A big source of replacement demand for his factory has been from these

-He’s getting lots of buyers from TikTok shops overseas. It seems like TikTok is helping a lot to mitigate the demand impact 

-The news story of Walmart, Target, Costco, etc. resuming some orders is true, he confirmed it. But the amounts are **very, very** small

**Pain**

-He’s already re-evaluating employees and firing some soon. He said most exporters in Guangzhou are cutting some employees, but extremely US dependent exporters have furloughed most of their workforces until mid May

**Some good news for the U.S?**

-Before Liberation Day he was building a factory in the US and has now fully committed to it. But it’s having issues since the raw materials are sourced from China and they’re getting hit with tariffs

[The full interview is here](https://www.yaphete.com/p/live-from-the-trade-war-2-chinas), I didn’t write everything here.

post,1kn8bij,,Why Industry Maps Matter 🗺️ A Closer Look at Gaming 🕹️ - Asking for Feedback,"**tl;dr**

* I'm working on my newsletter and trying to level up the **visual content** around investing.
* I picked the **gaming industry** 🕹️— one of the stronger-performing megatrend pockets in the market.
* I've made a couple of **industry maps** 🗺️ to help make sense of it.
* Personally, I like the depth of **Map 1**, but I also created a **simpler version (Map 2)** for a quick overview.
* **I'd love your feedback** — what's missing, what's overkill, what you'd change.
* I'm also thinking about a benchmarking slide deck: revenue growth, margins, ROIC, and shareholder returns.
* There's a ton of great content out there — deep-dive writeups, podcasts, CEO interviews. I might curate the best stuff — would that be useful?
* What else do you think would help retail or professional investors get a better grip on this space?
* I plan to cover other industries that benefit from secular tailwinds using the same framework, so I want to make sure it's actually useful and relevant.

post,1kqq4o9,,EV’s have been taking off in my city and I finally figured out why,"I live in a pretty rural area of western Pennsylvania and after paying a bit of attention to the specific cars around me, I got a good idea of how many EV’s were in my city. Outside of my own I had only ever really seen a couple Tesla’s but they weren’t popular. Less than 10, probably closer to 5 throughout the city. 

Over the past year there were a couple more that popped up including an EV9, and a Nissan Ariya. I’ve seen a couple chevy’s, both Blazers and equinox, and even a mustang. But the last couple months they’ve exploded. In My neighborhood there are 4 prologues out of nowhere. They’re easy to identify since I work from home and my desk is by the window near the stop sign. I always hear them as they come to a stop (the prologues are actually pretty loud with their hums) and they’re three different colors and the fourth has a bunch of decals. I’ve also seen some new blazers around. 

I stopped in at a local shop and was talking to the owner like normal and she mentioned getting a Blazer. Last person I would’ve thought, and 70+ year old lady on the verge of retirement. I asked what made her switch and she explained. She took her ICE in to get it serviced and the dealer made a new policy. Any loaner vehicle that wasn’t kept overnight required to be an EV. She said it was the safest and most comfortable she’s ever been in a car. She said she got her car back and that’s really when she felt how much she missed the car. She went back 2 weeks later to buy what she test drove. And the family that owns the dealership she goes to also owns the Honda dealership. 

That’s the biggest obstacle. Getting people to drive one, not necessarily buy them. Obviously the end goal is to buy and get more on the road, but instead of just talk talk talk, focus on just getting people to drive one. She wasn’t encouraged to buy it, just given it for a day. And that’s likely what happened with a lot of the prologues. GM and Honda are massive brands and have a lot of brand loyalty.",2261,True,1747696292.0,2025-05-20 01:11:32,1787,516,Buckles01,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kqq4o9/evs_have_been_taking_off_in_my_city_and_i_finally/,True,0.98,2025,tesla,top,False,False,0,

This.  As derisive as Tesla is at the moment, you can't argue their charging network.  But even here,  most chargers aren't that near airports. Not knowing how long it'll take to charge or how busy the charger is doesn't help either when there's a flight you need to catch.   

And this is the easiest to use option.  

CCS in North America? 
Deposits that have to be made in an app you have to download with chargers being broken constantly or that have 1 stall that's full.   I wouldn't wish that on anyone.    

I regularly rented Tesla because they were cheap.  They offered me a bolt once and I refused.  Even if the car was excellent the charging network is not, especially since I didn't bring any RFID cards with me.

For reference, my 2.5 year old LFP Model 3 is already down to around 94-96% capacity, depending on how you measure, after only 631 hours of driving, which equates to 23.5k miles. So 7000 hours of cycling is probably in the 200k-300k miles ballpark, potentially more if you do mostly highway driving.

Edit: I should note, however, that even for current LFP batteries, most of the degradation seems to be from calendar aging, not cyclical (usage-based) aging, so other LFP Tesla owners with 2.5 year old cars likely have similar remaining capacity to me, regardless of whether they drove 5k miles or 50k miles.

When asked directly if he saw himself continuing as Tesla’s CEO in five years’ time, Musk answered with a simple “Yes.” Pressed further, he added with a laugh, “I can’t be still here if I’m dead.”

Musk’s statements on his continued leadership comes amid growing scrutiny over his political ties and time commitments to projects beyond Tesla, including the U.S. government’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Along with his involvement in DOGE, Musk has donated at least $250 million in support of Trump’s re-election campaign, but that appears to be over, at least for now. Musk said, “I’ve done enough.

- bigger battery: right now the model S has a 90/100 kWh battery, let's put in the CT battery, so a 120-125kwh, so that it also get's ahead of the lucid and a no-compromise 300 mile/500 km range.

It would also help with towing on the model X

- even faster on the plaid trim

Aka I want the specs that Tesla unveiled for the plaid+ in 2021

- more colors, we really need a dark green ( like the Alfa Romeo one, there was also a model 3 wrap that looked stunning)

- self presenting/soft closing doors

- automatic frunk open/close

- elettro-obscurable roof glass, like the taycan.

It's like buying a first edition land cruiser with $23k of dealer accessories and $8k of markup and then complaining about ""depreciation"" a year later when supply has caught up and you can get one OTD for under MSRP, doesn't make it any more or less successful of a truck for toyota.

post,1ktchqb,,The Lamborghini of Nauru's Police Chief?,"Seeking information regarding a Lamborghini reportedly located on the island nation of Nauru near Australia.

During a period of economic prosperity on Nauru, a story emerged about a police chief (or official) who acquired a Lamborghini. This individual was reportedly too large to comfortably operate the vehicle.

Request: Does anyone have factual information regarding this specific Lamborghini? This includes details such as the model year, any known history, or its current status. Photographic evidence would also be of interest.

I was able to find a BBC article mentioning it from 2008 mentioning it, but that was all I was able to find. Does anyone know which model it was, or what ended up happening to it? This would have been late 70's early 80's most likely. So possibly a Countach or Jalpa.

BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) -Nvidia will launch a new artificial intelligence chipset for China at a significantly lower price than its recently restricted H20 model and plans to start mass production as early as June, sources familiar with the matter said.

The GPU or graphics processing unit will be part of Nvidia's latest generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors and is expected to be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, well below the $10,000-$12,000 the H20 sold for, according to two of the sources.

The lower price reflects its weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements.

It will be based on Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a server-class graphics processor and will use conventional GDDR7 memory instead of more advanced high bandwidth memory, the two sources said.

They added it would not use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's advanced Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology.

The new chip's price, specifications and production timing have not previously been reported.

The three sources Reuters spoke to for this article declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to media.

An Nvidia spokesperson said the company was still evaluating its ""limited"" options. ""Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China's $50 billion data center market.""

TSMC declined to comment.

The dgaf politically group will buy whatever car makes sense for them. There might be a small % that will hesitate due to the whole “Roman” salute situation but it’s likely a very small subset since the mainstream media basically shrugged it off.

**Key Takeaways**

* Nvidia's scheduled earnings Wednesday highlight the tech financial reports calendar this week, along with quarterly updates from Salesforce, Marvell Technologies, Dell, and HP. Other noteworthy reports expected include retailers Costco, AutoZone, and Dick’s Sporting Goods.
* Friday’s PCE inflation report will provide insight into price pressure in April, while investors will also be following updates to first-quarter GDP, the U.S. trade balance, and consumer confidence.
* Federal Reserve officials set to speak this week include Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller and New York Fed President John Williams, coming as the Fed is scheduled to release the minutes from its May meeting.

Nvidia (NVDA) earnings and a key inflation report highlight this week’s holiday-shortened calendar as investors continue to evaluate the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and economic policies.

Tech companies Salesforce (CRM), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Dell Technologies (DELL), and HP (HPQ) are expected to deliver earnings this week. Market watchers will also be looking for reports from retailers Costco Wholesale (COST), AutoZone (AZO), Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS), and Temu parent PDD Holdings (PDD).

The reports are set to arrive after a down week for stocks, which was punctuated Friday by a revival of trade-related uncertainty. You can recap last week's trading here.

In addition to Friday's personal consumption expenditures inflation report on Friday, investors will also be tuned into first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) updates and the latest data on the U.S. trade balance and retail inventories. Consumer confidence and sentiment surveys also will be in focus.

Several Fed officials are on the speaking calendar, including Federal Reserve Gov.",7347,True,1748178984.0,2025-05-25 15:16:24,66,4,callsonreddit,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kv2as8/what_to_expect_in_the_markets_this_week_may_2730/,True,0.91,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kvcs9x,,TSLA vs. BYDDY – Which EV Stock Is the Better Bet Right Now?,"Let’s keep it real  Tesla’s got the hype, but BYD is quietly crushing it

Yeah, Tesla’s talking a big game with Full Self-Driving, robotaxis, and household robots. Cool stuff, but it's all *future*. Meanwhile, their core EV business? Slipping. Q1 deliveries were the worst in over two years (337k), and they’re losing global market share. Stock's riding on promises

Then there’s BYD. Not as flashy, but they’re dominating China 34% of the NEV market in 2024, $107B in revenue (more than Tesla!), and some insane charging tech (250 miles in 5 minutes?!). Plus, their cars are affordable. Under $10K for an EV? That’s game-changing

Sure, BYD isn’t as far along with FSD, but they’re investing $14B into making smarter cars. And the stock’s trading at a sane valuation (under 27x earnings). Tesla? Still moon-high

Bottom line: If you’re betting on wild future tech, TSLA might be your pick. But if you care about solid execution, real revenue, and smart expansion  I’m rolling with BYDDY",987,False,1748206380.0,2025-05-25 22:53:00,66,131,Necromantion,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kvcs9x/tsla_vs_byddy_which_ev_stock_is_the_better_bet/,True,0.73,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kw2152,,"Data after 50,000+ miles across a Bolt EUV and a Tesla Model 3","I have a separate meter for my 2023 Tesla Model 3 RWD that I use to track energy use, efficiency, cost (and cost-savings), etc., and compare back to very detailed data I kept on my previous ICE car. 

Given I've now driven >30,000 miles, it felt like a good time to share the data and because I had it, I also shared comparisons to the Bolt EUV. 

|Measure|2023 Tesla Model 3 RWD|2022 Bolt EUV FWD|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Miles**|30,499|19,912|
|**Total kWh**|9,028|6,547|
|**Wh/Mi; Mi/kWh; MPGe**|296; 3.38; 114|329; 3.04; 103|
|**Average Temp**|49F|52F|
|**Savings ; Tax**\*\*\*|$2,076.44; $437.37|$1,454.89; $279.50|

**SAVINGS**  
*\*I benchmarked the fuel costs associated against my prior car, a Toyota Corolla which got 33.17 mpg over the 100,000+ miles I tracked it, and I also benchmarked against current gas prices, which in my area have been roughly $3/gallon but I am using nuanced* [*monthly averages for my state*](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM_EPMRU_PTE_NUS_DPG&f=W)*. I also bake in a $30 oil change per 5,000 miles as ""fuel"".* 

*\*\*I also calculated the portion of my savings that is due to taxes I'm not paying at the pump (0.285+0.184 per gallon) - which is relevant politically given we can expect a $250/year EV surcharge to attempt to ""close that loophole"", which for me, looks to be ""fair"" if it were state + federal, but just being federal and* combine*d with my state's surcharge ($75), it is not.* 

I have insurance, tabs, depreciation, maintenance, as well but wanted to focus on ""fuel"". Those costs are all higher than the Corolla due to the Tesla (and Bolt) being much newer cars (and fully insured instead of minimally insured) and the heightened costs do offset the fuel-savings for now. I'll be curious to see over 100,000+ miles how the total cost to own tightens up and I expect the Tesla to win out.

post,1kwjdmm,,TSLA: Why I'm still bullish despite the EPS nosedive,"Been holding TSLA since 2021 and just watched their recent earnings with mixed feelings. While everyone's freaking out about the 53% EPS drop, I've been trying to make sense of why the stock is still up 37% over the same period. Either I'm missing something or the market is.

My position: 120 shares @ $187 average (up about 81% total)

The Q1 earnings were objectively bad

EPS of $0.27 vs expected $0.41 (missed by 34%)

Factory changeovers for Model Y killed production numbers

Automotive margins down to 19% from previous highs in the mid-20s

Musk sounding increasingly distracted on the call

Yet I'm still holding and even added 15 shares on the post-earnings dip. Here's why:

The energy business is quietly becoming a monster

While everyone obsesses over car deliveries, Tesla's energy storage business hit record gross profit with 26% margins. My brother works in commercial solar, and he says Megapack orders are backlogged for months. The margins here are substantially better than automotive, and it's growing faster.

The robotaxi bet could pay off big

I was skeptical about the robotaxi timeline until I saw the Austin test videos. If they actually launch paid rides next month as planned, it changes everything about the valuation model. Even if it's limited geographically, proving the technology works would be massive.

Optimus robot could be the sleeper hit

The Optimus humanoid robot is another wild card that could transform Tesla's business model. They're planning to have thousands of units in production by year-end, ramping to potentially a million units annually by 2030. Imagine having one of these handling household chores, elder care, or factory work. The addressable market is potentially enormous if they can deliver even half of what they're promising.",2949,True,1748339881.0,2025-05-27 11:58:01,125,48,faharxpg,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kwjdmm/tsla_why_im_still_bullish_despite_the_eps_nosedive/,True,0.5,2025,both,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kwrt8l,,New 3-row EV comparison,"Below is the summary by Google NotebookLM

* **Kia EV9**
   * **Price:** Starts at $54,900, or basically $55,000, making it the cheapest and best value vehicle in the three-row segment. The as-tested price of the specific model shown was just over $70,000, around $72,000. You can get the Land trim with a large battery pack and dual motor for this price. Leasing is also mentioned as very cheap, around $299 per month with about $2500 down (taxes included in Colorado).
   * **Range:** The video mentions the EPA rated range is put up. The large battery pack is almost 100 kilowatt hours. The range is described as ""not all that much,"" just under 100 kilowatt hours, but considered an ""easy justification"" for the price.
   * **Charging Performance:** Charging performance is noted as being good due to its EGMP platform. The peak charging speed is about 220 kW briefly, but most of the time it's about 200 kW, and it holds this speed deep into the pack, sitting at just about 200 kW up to 80%. This makes it an amazing charging vehicle for road trips. However, it's the only vehicle in the comparison that doesn't natively interface well with the Tesla Supercharger network, getting a maximum of 84 kW currently, though this is expected to increase to 125 kW for model year 2026. It uses an onboard booster for Supercharging and can be buggy.
* **Cadillac Vistic**
   * **Price:** Described as ""quite a bit more money than the Kia,"" starting around $80,000 base, with the as-tested model around $84,000. Higher trims can go up to $100,000.
   * **Range:** Shares the Lyric battery, which GM quotes as 102 kilowatt hours capacity, though it's closer to 105-106 kWh. The battery capacity is only about 10 to 20 kWh more than the smaller Equinox and Optic, which feels like a lot of money for the battery size in a large car. The range is mentioned as being one of the ""big oversightes"".",5740,True,1748363523.0,2025-05-27 18:32:03,152,218,yangqi,electricvehicles,https://youtu.be/METibmN_xPg?si=XMI_sjIgauUCbomJ,False,0.8,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

No Apple, Amazon, or Tesla which are too consumer facing. Have the AI tech behemoths, which are also the true quantum plays. Have insurance companies, contrarian bets, mix of mid cap growth companies which have proven themselves with continuously strong earnings reports, and few crazy growth stories.

**The Rules**: DCA daily, when fear and greed index dumps below 25 then aggressively DCA even lump sum. If a company has more than 2 bad earnings more-so guidance than they're out.

**Good Time To Buy?**: I believe they're all overpriced right now. Will hedge with UVXY calls buying monthlies, selling against the position creating diagonals at various strikes when there's an upcoming binary event which could be negative catalyst.

**Changes This Time**: Am combining timing the market increasing DCA'ing amounts, actively managing based off of ER's/guidance, and hedging against during drawdowns using longer dated uvxy calls.

comment,1kwulr6,1kwulr6,,"People are giving you incomplete answers here.

What you noticed probably isn't magic or a placebo.

On Teslas, if the alignment data is reset in the service menu, the car ""forgets"" where the center point of the alignment ""actually physically is"", and sets back to 0 degrees relative to the steering column. Over the next 5, 10, 20, 50 miles, the car keeps track of the position of the steering wheel when the car is driving straight and applies an offset to the value, which adjusts where the car sees it's home/base steering position value. This affects the pull of the steering wheel. This is so that if the steering wheel is off by 1 or 2 degrees, the car won't forever ""pull"" to straighten the wheel out. It'll learn exactly what position the steering wheel must be in for the car to go perfectly straight, and will pull toward that position.

Let's say your tesla had a learned steering offset of -2 degrees. You might not even realize. Car drives perfectly straight with no pull left or right. Then you hit a pothole and bend something or mess something up, and now the ""real center point"" of the steering in order to go down the road straight is more like PLUS 2 degrees instead of minus 2 degrees. The steering wheel is going to be pulling to one side when you let go of the wheel. If somebody went in and RESET that learned steering offset value, now it's back to ""0"" and the steering wheel is going to be pulling to that side HALF as badly.",2459,True,1748371059.0,2025-05-27 20:37:39,21,0,Douche_Baguette,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kwulr6/could_my_tesla_have_fixed_its_own_alignment/muk8kje/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,muk8kje

post,1kwx3a7,,Headrest Question,"
Hi everyone,

I noticed yesterday that my passenger headrest in my 2021 Model Y. From my research, this appears to be a common issue.

I sent in a service request and received an invoice for $205. Looking on third-party sites, I can find OEM headrests for ~$50 and can easily replace it myself. However, this OEM number is 1623801-00-A. The OEM part for the headrest that Tesla quoted me was 1623798-91-C.

Again doing research, I cannot find much difference between these OEM parts. Both appear to fit my 2021 MY. It appears the Tesla quoted OEM would include abilities for “special features”? I am not sure what special features would be included in my headrest. 

Would anyone be able to guide me in the right direction here?",729,False,1748375823.0,2025-05-27 21:57:03,1,7,ImmediateMajor4337,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwx3a7,False,0.6,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kx17ua,,Seat position discrepancy between 2026 and 2021(or older versions) Model Y - Anyone else noticing this?,"I recently upgraded from a 2021 Model Y to a 2026 Model Y, and I've noticed something odd when syncing my profile between the two vehicles. When I save my seat position in the 2026 Model Y and then use the same profile in my 2021 Model Y, the seat position in the older model ends up much farther back (the recline) than it is in the new model. 
Has anyone else who has upgraded to a 2026 Model Y while keeping their older Model Y experienced this? I'm wondering if it's due to differences in the seat design or the reclining mechanism between the two. The steering wheel position seems to sync just fine, but the seat position, particularly the recline, feels off way off, this is vice versa because if I change the position in the 2021 it's much closer position to the steering wheel in the 2026.

He’s definitely been showing his ass a lot more within the past year.  His shilling for Musk and Trump is pathetic.  He’s proven many times over the years he knows better, so the current views are an appeal to cult populism.

The biggest lie abiut him is regarding his returns.  On Wall Street, his performance was legitimately excellent.  He averaged something like 24-27% *after* fees, for over 15 years.  That doesn’t happen by luck.  His major calls since retiring would have made you an 8 figure millionaire.  That’s possibly why he spews such overconfidence in things like TSLA and AAPL.  Put simply, they’ve been major multi-bagger successful stories for him, so from his perspective, why not?

He’s a genius in multiple subject areas which is probably what made him a narcissist.  One such area is market whispering, and that has helped his results through some legendary “sell all” calls in which he’s kept his portfolios from getting whacked down to the average.  

He’s made many big and powerful enemies, and they’re the source of 98% of the criticism you’ve absorbed.

post,1kx4kb9,,Model 3 HW4 FSD Software Crashes and AP Critical Alerts. Any experience or advice?,"I wanted to get some input from you guys related to an issue I've been having with my 2024 Model 3 to see if anyone else has experienced my issue and if so, what did Tesla do to resolve it:

  
Over the past several months, I've had an intermittent issue where I'll be using FSD and the car will start alarming and saying to take over immediately followed by ""Autopilot aborted due to system error"". It then takes 5 or so minutes for it to come back online. At first, I brushed it off as a bug in the software, but it became more frequent and recently went as far as braking to a stop and putting itself in park in the middle of a highway.

  
What's odd is that after it does its reboot, there are no lingering user facing errors or notifications to get the vehicle serviced. In service mode the main alert showing up is APS\_w159\_apbCritical which states ""*Autopilot Processor Secondary (APS) detects that the Autopilot Processor Backup (APB) is not functioning as expected, making Autopilot (AP) features unavailable.""* 

  
I've already made a service appointment, but the Tesla service technician seemed to be dismissive of there being a real problem and scheduled me pretty far out. My concern is that this seems to keep happening on multiple software versions and does not seem to be a common error other drivers are reporting. The most info I can find seems to revolve around the 2024 holiday update bricking model 3s built in the same month mine was, but I had no issue with the update and my car does not completely loose FSD/AP after rebooting like other cars did.

  
If anyone can give any anecdotal experience with a similar issue and/or advice on handling the service appointment, I'd greatly appreciate it!",1723,False,1748395389.0,2025-05-28 03:23:09,1,3,Isotopicgoose,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kx4kb9/model_3_hw4_fsd_software_crashes_and_ap_critical/,True,0.6,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

I’m looking into buying a used Model 3 or Model Y here in Dallas, TX, and wanted to see if anyone could share some advice or experiences.

A few things I’d love input on:
1. Any thoughts on which one makes more sense for Texas driving? 
2. Anything I should check for when it comes to battery health or specific model years to avoid?
3. Does the Tesla warranty still apply if I’m buying used from a third party?
4. What kind of problems have you run into?
5. How does adding Full Self-Driving work on a used car? Can I buy it later through the app?

So now T wants me to come in again, so that they can replace both front seats. At my last visit, on Friday, roof was replaced bc it was 6mm off (specs are 1-1.5, so 6 is way off) but now it whistles like an open window. I am at my wit’s end with this car. There is no joy.

* Yes, the warranty still applies for used through 3rd party. I purchased a used 2023 through the tesla site and received an additional warranty.
* I had to rotate the tires but they were in good shape for 21k miles. I recommend low mileage if it’s in your budget. Long range used tend to have lots of miles. I wanted one but the standard range is doing just fine. I also had to change the filters. The car needs new wipers. That’s it for maintenance. My car had a crack in the sunroof that I missed during delivery. Fortunately Tesla replaced it free.
* I had FSD free for 30 days loved it. It comes with a subscription for all Tesla’s at $99/month plus tax. You can purchase through the car or app. You may also wantbto subscribe to the premium connectivity for internet service it was cheaper to subscribe to a one year term for like $100.
* Do a thorough walk through. Make a list or find one online.
* If this is your first EV consider the costs for charger installation Nema or wall charger. Will the car come with a mobile charger? Mine did not so I paid like $300 for mobile and $515 for wall charger plus install.
* Try to get the $4k tax credit if you can. Tesla offers it at point of sale and so does Carvana.

This is my first EV and during my research 90% of Tesla owners recommended percentage (seems to be consistent with the comments here). That’s what I’m using however it did take some getting used to. 

*Tip: while learning your vehicle, take it on a trip and see how the percentage/mileage changes as you accelerate. Be sure to use GPS. Then try to get to a steady speed and see how consistent it becomes. The percentage/mileage for your trip will become more accurate and you will know that the change/accuracy for the GPS is in your control. Not much different than any other car. Higher RPM’s means you’re buring more gas/mile. The Tesla doesn’t exactly have this gauge, at least not in my model 3.

comment,1kx5c3a,1kx5c3a,,">""In China, we see intense competition and Tesla is no longer seen as the technology leader.""

I think this is the real kicker here. 

While the sales decline worldwide (especially in the US) has *some* to do with Elon's salute and his time at Doge,  I think other factors have contributed much more to it. Tesla's sales have been shrinking for the past two years.

A very limited and aging lineup, 3/5 of which are out of the reach of the average person has played a big role. More people want SUVs over sedans, so Tesla is effectively competing with just one model. I don't think the refresh was significant enough for people to want to upgrade.

I too believe that nobody thinks of them as the technology leader anymore which is why the competition has been able to gain a foothold. 

Their tech is still better than the competition in North America in the sense that everything just works and works seamlessly, lag free, but I don't think that's gonna cut it anymore.

1. Car cannot be more than $25000, not counting tax, title and license (all that other crap counts towards the $25000 limit)
2. Your taxable income for the year you are applying for (you can retro apply it to last year) can't be more than $75000 ($150,000 joint).
3. Car has to be only one previous owner. (Ask the dealer for the carmax report...it will tell you if it is only 1-owner or not)
4. The model of the used EV must be 2 years or more older than the current model out.
5. Also must be from a dealer, not a personal sale (not 100% sure on this part)...because the dealer has to register with the IRS in order to give you credit for the used EV.   As a matter of fact, when I bought it, the dealer did the paperwork for me, sent it in and gave me the credit in about 2 weeks and released the car to me.  Didn't need to wait to wait for a refund to get it back.

SOunds like a lot, but it's worth saving $4000

Also if you can swing it, you can get some great deals on 2023  Model 3 for right at $25000, with very low mileage and still have warranty on it.  I got a 2023 Model 3 at $21000 after the credit.  Had 25K miles on it and still had a year of warranty left.

If you going to do it, get it done before Trump takes it away in the Big bullshit bill...not sure when that's going into effect.",1378,False,1748408269.0,2025-05-28 06:57:49,9,0,BigAssMonkey,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kx7hp9/seems_like_a_great_deal/munbyaq/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,munbyaq

post,1kxf90a,,Suggestion: enable/disable accessory power via App/API,"I love that we can now enable/disable accessory power through the vehicle. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like this is possible via the [vehicle commands API](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/vehicle-commands#charge-max-range) or through the Tesla App itself. My use case: I have a battery-powered (independent of the vehicle HV/LV batteries) Dashcam that charges via the onboard 12V when I'm driving the car. 



Unfortunately, during long absences between driving / very short drives, I'm not able to charge the battery enough to get a reliable 12 - 14 hours of standby recording. I could leave the setting on permanently but this is wasteful and results in significantly higher idle-power usage. 



Ideally, I'd like a setting where I could have 12V power for 1-2 hours (enough to charge the battery, and then shutoff). Rivian has a feature like this and I've found it super helpful. It would also be cool to enable this as an API command and then use Tessie to trigger automations.



Why do I use an external dashcam? The optical quality of Blackvue dashcams is superior to Tesla's cameras and this has allowed me to capture license plate details where Tesla's built-in cameras have failed. I also like the fact that the front lens features a 136 degree wide horizontal capture angle, which allows me to get more of the road. I use a battery so that the dashcam can record even when the vehicle is off.",1428,False,1748433637.0,2025-05-28 14:00:37,5,4,JamMydar,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kxf90a/suggestion_enabledisable_accessory_power_via/,True,0.86,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kxi4rf,,If the tax credits go away when would be the last day we could use them on a new Tesla?,"[EDIT] This has been answered in the comments, thanks to everyone who chimed in! 

I had the opportunity to sit behind the wheel of a new Model Y this past weekend. Family came for a visit and had just gotten one along with the FSD package. As a tech guy this was probably the coolest thing I've seen in a long while and now I'm looking to sell my current car and get a Model 3 and FSD. We went on multiple road trips and I was just utterly amazed that I didn't have to touch the wheel or pedals no matter if we were on city, windy country, highway, or neighborhood roads. Parked and parallel parked itself. Could summon it over to us. I'm blown away!

Also unclear about level two chargers. I have a ccs combo 1 adapter but have had experiences where it just won’t work or stay connected to some stations. 

Any tips or experiences you all could share?  

Also am confused about the charge rates for New Brunswick and PEI. Example of a PEI station of 0-60 kWh at $0.44, 60-100kwh at $0.89, 100-180 kWh at $1.39 and 180-250 kWh at $2.33

You never know when incentives will change.  If you plan on financing a Model Y, the 1.99% APR deal is really amazing and is a huge discount people tend to not realize.  Plus all the extra referral discounts and everything, it's really hard to beat todays price on a Juniper.

I was really excited about the ID Buzz but I’ve realized it’s a failure in the US. Tried to capture why I think it’s failing - can informed folks please weigh in. 

1. Price. The higher trims hit mid $70K and there are just fewer customers in this segment (irrespective of brand, range etc). 
2. Range. For a car starting mid $60Ks, a range of 230 miles is just not acceptable. It’s off by a 100 miles actually. 
3. No incentives. Since this isn’t made in the U.S. Also no special lease deals in the U.S.  
4. Minivans are just not popular, especially compared to SUVs. Doesn’t matter how novel it looks. 
5. Marketing. Unfortunately, there is almost no effective marketing campaigns to promote the vehicle. 

I am saddened to make this list as I wanted to see this vehicle to be a “Model Y” killer. But ugh.

post,1kxnxwe,,Tesla model y cpo reservation Issue,"So I have reserved a 2021 model y used car paid 500$ for it on May 9th over a phone call of 45 mins confirming that I will not be available for 2 weeks and can't take delivery and they confirmed the estimate says 2 weeks you have time.

May 12th I get this notification to pick up car in next 4 days or it will be cancelled

I tried to reach out to tesla about contradicting what they said on the phone but got ""as per order agreement"" to my face, no help

Upon checking the auto report the car is build and sold in sep 2020 without the wireless charhing, heat pump and other 2021 features, I felt betrayed and asked about it and they said it's standard procedure across the Industry, year doesn't mean you get the features - I was like but it says 2021 and I thought it will have the features, they said again ""as per order agreement""

Now I escalated this to used car manager and he says he put a mail to director is what he claims atleast and says got response from director and as per order agreement no refund no transfer if you don't take delivery it will be canceled. I said that is not fair please listen to call logs I gave them date and time too, again ""as per order agreement....

Now I do not know what to do
some friends suggest file bbb complaint or raise a dispute but I want to get a tesla and I will buy a tesla if not this car, so I do not want to be flagged from tesla for the bbb complaint or a chargeback

What option do I have now?
Is there anyway to get my $500 back?

For people who want to see the details, subsection 112002(a) of the bill says:

        (a) In General.--Section 30D is amended--
                (1) by redesignating subsection (h) as subsection (i), and
                (2) in subsection (i), as so redesignated, by striking 
            ``December 31, 2032'' and inserting ``December 31, 2026''

This changes [26 USC Section 30D(h)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&edition=prelim&req=granuleid%3AUSC-2010-title26-section30D&num=0) to read:

>~~(h)~~ **(i)** Termination

>No credit shall be allowed under this section with respect to any vehicle placed in service after ~~December 31, 2032~~ **December 31, 2026**.

The next subsection of the bill goes on to say that for vehicles placed in service during 2026, there is a 200,000 vehicle cap. So, for Tesla, the substantive language can effectively be summarized as: ""No credit shall be allowed under this section with respect to any Tesla vehicle placed in service after December 31, 2025.""

We can then read [26 CFR Section 1.30D-2(b)(36)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-26/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-1/subject-group-ECFRcb39f040b41b74b/section-1.30D-2) for what ""placed in service"" means:

post,1kxrc5b,,"Leno's Law [35 year smog exemption in CA] has passed a major hurdle, but lost some of its teeth.","Around a month ago the 35 year smog exemption was placed in suspense while the appropriations committee spent more time on it. On Friday it successfully made it out of the appropriations committee, and should (hopefully) get a full vote by the CA senate.

But in the appropriations committee they made some modifications that make it somewhat less useful. The important part of the current amended text now reads:

***(c)  For purposes of subdivision (a), a collector motor vehicle, as defined in Section 259 of the Vehicle Code, is exempt from those portions of the test required by subdivision (f) of Section 44012 if the collector motor vehicle meets all of the following criteria:***

* ***(1) Submission of proof that the motor vehicle is insured as a collector motor vehicle, as shall be required by regulation of the bureau.***
* ***(2) The motor vehicle is at least 35 model years old.***
* ***(3) The motor vehicle complies with the exhaust emissions standards for that motor vehicle’s class and model year as prescribed by the department, and the motor vehicle passes a functional inspection of the fuel cap and a visual inspection for liquid fuel leaks.***

Both (1) and (3) represent a significant modification from the previous text. It looks like you'll have to submit some paperwork to do.

(3) Makes it unclear to me what actual benefit this bill will have if it gets passed. This gives the department (DMV) significant leeway to prescribe emissions standards that could really moot the whole point of the bill. We may not have a good idea what those will be until this is actually implemented, but I'm not overwhelmingly hopeful given the history of this kind of thing.

post,1kxsby5,,"Tesla targets June 12 launch for robotaxi service in Austin, Bloomberg News reports","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-targets-june-12-launch-204524186.html

(Reuters) -Tesla is poised to begin its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin on June 12, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The date has been discussed internally and could still change, the report added.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Earlier this month, CEO Elon Musk said the EV maker is set to begin a test of its long-promised robotaxi service on schedule in Austin, Texas, by the end of June.

A successful robotaxi trial is crucial for Tesla as Musk has shifted the company's focus away from building a new, cheaper EV platform to launching the robotaxi service and its Optimus humanoid robots. Much of Tesla's valuation hangs on that bet.

Tesla sales have fallen worldwide with rising competition and as Musk faces a backlash for his political views and his role as an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Let’s face it: the number of enthusiasts with cars whose model years are between 1976 and 1990, and who want an exemption, is low.

So what’s the goddamn harm in them getting an unlimited-mileage exemption on visual testing and creating an average emissions level for engine size, method of fueling, and aspiration? 

All 1.6-liter (1551cc through 1650cc) engines that are EFI and naturally aspirated have to meet the same standard. All 1.8-liter (1751cc through 1850cc) engines that are EFI and turbocharged have to meet the same standard. Cats are unlimited, but required.

The state has the information from which to build the necessary numbers but doesn’t, because CARB is stupid- necessary and helpful, but stupid.

I just picked up a 2025 Model 3 Performance and I’m looking into getting a spare tire setup. I know these don’t come with one, and I’m not super comfortable relying only on the repair foam kit.

I’m fine with buying a full-size aftermarket wheel if needed. (I’ve heard 19"" wheels can work) but I want to make sure whatever I get fits properly, especially with the Performance model’s larger brakes.

Also, I’ve seen a few posts mention something about a locator bolt or retention bolt that might need to be removed for certain aftermarket wheels or spare tires to fit. Can anyone confirm that or explain what I’d need to do?

post,1kxu7oq,,First-Time EV Buyer's Guide,"I often help people on the weekly General Questions and Purchasing Advice thread, and have been thinking about doing something like this to compile my answers to common questions. I'm going to structure it like a guide for each part of the buying process, but it's more like a collection of my thoughts. I'd be happy to add to it if anyone has anything else to contribute! This is also US-centric (sorry). 

#The Starting Line
So you want to buy an EV eh? Awesome! The process is, in general, very similar to buying a standard internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, but with a few key additional areas of research. I'm going to assume you generally know the basics of ICE vehicle ownership, and make this guide as specific as possible the electric portion of the vehicle purchasing. 

Let me say this up top though if you are on the fence for an EV. If you can charge at home and have a two-car (or more) household, you 100% should make one of those cars an EV. You'll save money on gas and oil changes, and experience the convenience of leaving home with a full ""tank"" every morning. You can get a used Chevy Bolt or Tesla for less than $10k almost anywhere in the US if you qualify for the $4k tax credit, and they're great vehicles that can completely cover 99% of driving needs (and obviously there's plenty of vehicles at higher prices). If that's all you need to hear, go for it. 

# Assess your situation
As always you should buy a car that suits your needs. Trucks for construction work, vans for families, etc. EVs are no different, but you should ask yourself a few additional questions to determine which, if any, EV is right for you: 

* The first, most important question - do you have a place to charge? The main benefit EV owners cite is that the vehicle can ""refuel"" at home, every night. In contrast, the ""worst"" part of the experience is public charging.",15761,True,1748470421.0,2025-05-29 00:13:41,88,53,chilidoggo,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kxu7oq/firsttime_ev_buyers_guide/,True,0.96,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kxwjdj,,Tesla investors demand Musk work 40-hour week at EV maker as ‘crisis’ builds,"Elon Musk needs to spend more time at Tesla as his electric vehicle company faces a “crisis,” according to a letter on Wednesday from a group of pension fund leaders who manage investments in the company.

“Tesla’s stock price volatility, declining sales, as well as disconcerting reports regarding the company’s human rights practices, and a plummeting global reputation are cause for serious concern,” the investors wrote in a letter to Robyn Denholm, the company’s board chair. “Moreover, many issues are linked to Mr. Musk’s actions outside of his role as Technoking and Chief Executive Officer at Tesla, including his high-profile role as an architect of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).”

The investors want the Tesla board to require Musk to work a minimum of 40 hours per week at the automaker as a condition of any new compensation plan they may arrange for him. They also want a clear succession plan for management of the EV business, and a policy that would apply to all Tesla directors limiting their outside board commitments at public and private companies.

Early last year, the Delaware Court of Chancery ordered Tesla to rescind Musk’s 2018 CEO pay package, which had been worth around $56 billion, finding that Musk controlled the company, and the board’s compensation committee misled shareholders before seeking their vote to approve the plan.

Musk now says he wants even more shares, amounting to 25% voting control of the company.

Tesla’s brand value and reputation have declined since 2024, due largely to Musk’s incendiary rhetoric and political activities. In addition to pouring nearly $300 million into an effort to get Donald Trump back into the White House, Musk formally endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party ahead of the country’s parliamentary election this year.

At DOGE, Musk has led an initiative by the Trump administration to slash federal agencies.",3951,True,1748476658.0,2025-05-29 01:57:38,311,51,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kxwjdj/tesla_investors_demand_musk_work_40hour_week_at/,True,0.94,2025,both,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kxxgm4,,Co-sign on used EV credit.,"Hey everyone👋
We are thinking to get another tesla in the family and this time model Y. My brother bought model 3 last year and claimed ev tax credit and was making under 75k adjusted gross income. But now he makes more than that to qualify for used ev credit and we are thinking to get used model Y for our dad as he likes to drive tesla a lot. Our dad makes less than 75k a year but he came to USA 6 months ago and has a credit history of only 2 months so he needs a cosign for sure (which is my brother). So I just want to ask would my dad still qualify for 4k ev credit if my brother co signs (his name will be on the title under my name as cosign works this way I guess). If not we will consider a non-ev because then model Y doesn’t make sense.",750,False,1748479263.0,2025-05-29 02:41:03,0,3,Business_Ease5471,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kxxgm4/cosign_on_used_ev_credit/,True,0.5,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kxyf5a,,Model 3 - near disaster with 3 inch hail during update.,"I was waiting for my son to come home with the Model 3 we purchased yesterday. As soon as he got in the door, our phones went crazy. The NWS warned of 3 inch hail being imminent.  Ok, get Tesla into garage. Nope, my son started a software update when he got home.  The car would not start, nor would not go into neutral. We Googled for way to do it, but nothing. We saw a post talking about if it said downloading in app we can disconnect wifi.  That did the trick and we were able to drive it in the garage. Of course, the hail missed us.  It is not prompting for the update anymore. We got 2025.14.7.

comment,1kxxgm4,1kxxgm4,,"Let me get this straight:

* Your dad:
   * Intends to buy a used Tesla, 
   * Qualifies for the used EV tax credit,  
   * Wants to get the used EV tax credit, and
   * Does not qualify to get a loan to buy a Tesla.
* You and your brother:
   * Intend to put your names on the loan so your dad can get the loan and 
   * Do not qualify for the used EV tax credit.

Your question is, ""Will putting your name and your brother's name on the loan and (I presume) any title documents cause any problems with your dad getting the tax credit?"" 

Answer: probably not.  

As far as the IRS is concerned, it seems as though only the person the dealer reports to the IRS as the buyer needs to qualify for the used tax credit.  The IRS doesn't exactly say this, but here are the clues:

In [IRS FS-2024-26, page 4, A11](https://www.irs.gov/pub/taxpros/fs-2024-26.pdf#page=4), the IRS mentioned multiple people getting the *new* EV tax credit:

>The name and taxpayer identification number of the owner claiming the New Clean Vehicle Credit should be listed on the seller’s report. See Topic B, FAQ 9. Accordingly, multiple owners of a new clean vehicle should inform the seller which owner will claim the New Clean Vehicle Credit so that the seller can identify that taxpayer on the seller’s report. **The credit would be allowed only on the tax return of the owner listed in the seller’s report.",3559,True,1748482402.0,2025-05-29 03:33:22,3,0,SirMontego,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kxxgm4/cosign_on_used_ev_credit/mut2xr0/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mut2xr0

**Lease or Buy**: Buy  
**New or Used**: Used  
**Type of Vehicle**: Sedan or Crossover  
**Must Haves**: Reliable, decent resale, fun or comfortable to drive  
**Transmission**: Automatic  
**Intended Use**: Daily driver, light usage (\~1–2 years)  
**Vehicles Considered**: Used Tesla Model 3, Mazda CX-5 (2017), Chevy Cruze (2015)

**Additional Notes**:

I’m driving in Ann Arbor for at least a year, likely two. After that, I’ll either sell or bring the car to NYC — where street parking and crime make a nice car a risk.

# Option 1: Used Tesla Model 3 (2020+, ~$20–25K)

* Pros: Dream car, $4K EV tax credit, tech, fun to drive, could be worth it for 2 years of joy
* Cons: Battery degradation unknown, no home charger (would supercharge every 2 weeks), depreciation, might be overkill if I sell in 2 years or bring it to NYC

# Option 2:  Used Mazda CX-5 (2017+, ~$17-20K)

* Pros: Stylish, reliable, gas is simpler than charging, more peace of mind than Tesla, good resale
* Cons: Still relatively pricey, not EV, higher fuel and maintenance costs than Tesla

AND. It has to do both, not just an evap system.

That's how it works now. I can register my 30 year old federal emissions vehicle in California because it meets the standard it had to. The only snaffoo is when my cat fails I can't replace it with another federal cat, I must buy the expensive California cat. 

Concession #3 isn't a distinction I give a fuck about, it's expensive or expensiver. So everyone will still register it in Montana because you still have to maintain an expensive emissions system.

comment,1ky6ef5,1ky6ef5,,"Continuing our series on California EV sales in the first quarter, we’re now on to overall auto brand rankings. Why spend so much time on California? Well, if it was a country (and the rest of the US was still a country), it would be the 10th largest auto market in the world. Furthermore, it would rank even higher if we were focused on top EV markets. (Though, I don’t have that data on hand — perhaps a story for another day.)

  
Also, being the birthplace of Tesla and being a bastion of progressivism, it’s a fascinating market for examining Tesla sales trends. In fact, if we split the US up into states and combined European countries into one market (I know, now we’re getting weird), California would only trail China (\~135,000) and Europe (\~53,000) in Tesla sales.

Anyway, let’s get on to the trends. As you can see in the chart below, Tesla sales declined by about 7,000 units in the 1st quarter compared to the 1st quarter of 2024. With Honda climbing by about 5,000 sales (and Toyota climbing by about 5,000 sales), that actually meant that Tesla dropped from the second best selling auto brand in the Golden State to the third best selling auto brand in the Golden State.




When you consider that Tesla is the only pure EV brand on this ranking, that’s a hit to the EV market and EV growth.",2811,True,1748510835.0,2025-05-29 11:27:15,32,0,Wagamaga,technology,https://reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1ky6ef5/tesla_dropped_from_2_auto_brand_to_3_auto_brand/muur0pm/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,muur0pm

post,1ky8r5u,,NY Times: Export Controls Are Endangering the Fragile U.S.-China Truce,"Just two-and-a-half weeks after agreeing to suspend tariffs, both countries are using export controls to disrupt each other’s key industries.

After stepping back this month from an escalating and dangerous war of tariffs, the United States and China are now threatening to undermine their uneasy truce.

On May 12, the countries announced after weekend meetings in Geneva that they would suspend most of their recently imposed tariffs. Since then, however, both governments have shown that they are still prepared to wield controls over critical exports as weapons against one another, with moves that are potentially even more damaging to trade and global supply chains.

China has restricted its exports of rare earth magnets, which are crucial for cars, semiconductors, aircraft and many other applications. Close to 90 percent of the world’s rare earth metals, including magnets, are produced in China.

And the United States on May 13 banned the latest semiconductors from Huawei, a Chinese electronics giant. Then on Wednesday, President Trump suspended the shipment of American semiconductors and some aerospace equipment needed for China’s commercial aircraft, the C919, a signature project in China’s push toward economic self-reliance.

The increasing use of export controls by both countries amounts to supply chain warfare, interrupting the flow of key components that the other country must have to operate huge industries that employ large numbers of workers.

Last week, Ford Motor temporarily closed a factory in Chicago that makes Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles after one of its suppliers ran out of the magnets. In most new cars, the magnets are used in dozens of electric motors that operate brake and steering systems, fuel injectors and even power seats.

It shows in the map but Navigation refused to use it.  Instead it winds through a neighborhood, a condo complex and is taking unprotected lefts onto busy streets when it could take a wide, brand-new street with full modern traffic controls where most cars are going 60mph.  

I have only had my Tesla for two days, and reported this to them.  I wonder if it is the lack of speed limit. This makes me want to scream.

comment,1kxu7oq,1kxu7oq,,"I do think we have to address the budget buyer use case too. The used market for EV is strong and getting stronger, as EV owners turn over to their 2nd (or 3rd) EV purchases. 

Used 1st(ish) generation EVs are getting quite affordable. Obviously check the model or brand specific subreddit for common issues, but a used EV is a great value, even with nominal battery degradation. 

As an example, I was shopping for a new commuter car and I wanted an EV. I wanted a small, efficient EV that didn’t look ridiculous. I also didn’t want to spend $25k - $50k for a new car that would depreciate as soon as I signed the paperwork. 

I didn’t need a lot of range, since it’s going back and forth to work and around town. Automated driving was a low priority, because I actually like to drive, though some enhanced safety features are fine. Similarly, have the ability to use DCFC in a pinch was good, but I didn’t need huge max DC speed. 

After looking at leafs, ford focus EVs, miniEVs, and others, I zeroed in on the e-Golf. The 2017-20 versions have DCFC and a “larger” battery that gets over 125mi in EPA and real-life driving in good weather. Some also have heat pumps for HVAC that help mitigate winter losses, though at the cost of a potential failure point.

It’s worked extremely well for me and it’s nice to get a short walk in the neighborhood. As such I’ve never supercharged except in road trips. It’s also a lot cheaper than supercharging.

For road trips I regularly travel out of state and it works extremely well. I prefer the ABRP app for routes though, as I think the car nav isn’t great for time optimization.

post,1kyk96u,,Wall connector: NACS or Universal,"Hey there,
I have a 26 Juniper and 21 Bolt. Obviously, different connectors for charging with NACS and J1772. 

I moved recently and to have a new plug installed outside with my Grizzl-E’s NEMA 14-50 is not recommended without a GCFI breaker. I have decided to sell the Grizzl-E and purchase a Tesla wall connector. 

I regularly charge my Bolt at Superchargers with a A2Z EV CCS1 to NACS connector and also own a A2Z EV NACS to J1772 connector. 

Which way do you think I should go?

1. Tesla Wall Connector with NACS only and then use the A2Z adapter with the Bolt. 
2. Tesla Universal Wall Connector with NACS and J1772. 

Cost difference is $420 vs $650.

post,1kyl4rv,,Question about Tesla Cars,"Hello,

I’d like to start this off by saying that I have this problem where people keep hitting my car. Doesn’t matter if I’m stopped at a red light or just driving in my own lane. Somehow, people keep hitting me. I haven’t been at fault for any of these incidents so far. I’m pretty fed up with this because I’ve had my car for less than one year and it has been hit three times. I don’t even live in a big city. 

So, my question is: will a Tesla alert me if another car makes contact with mine, even if it’s just a really small bump? 

In one of the incidents I had, I was on a busy highway, stopped at a red light. I noticed the person behind me was super close to me but my car didn’t move and I didn’t hear a sound (my window was down) so I drove off. Later I checked and there was a dent in my car where the person hit me.

Do you guys think a Tesla would “help” me with this issue? I just want it to alert me even if the other car barely touched mine.

post,1kyld3i,,New vehicle purchase - check my gas/kWh math please,"TLDR: upgrading from a 35mpg (city) 2nd gen Prius to PHEV or EV, think either one will save us in the long run as gasoline costs increase here in California, but based on my math it is not looking feasible. I need some input if my math needs to account for other factors. 

For context, my wife has a 2007 Prius that's reliable but showing its age. Haven't done much highway driving lately but have been tracking the last few fuel purchases of mostly city driving and it seems to be getting about 35mpg lately. Regular 87 octane is holding at around $4/gallon. So approx 11.4 cents per mile for fuel only (not including maintenance, etc).
Central Valley CA. We are expected to see gas in the $6-8 range within the next 2 years due to refineries shutting down permanently, unless there is some course correction with the political winds.

Our goal in a new vehicle is to upgrade from what we currently have and have a vehicle that is good for long trips. We think PHEV is the ideal candidate. It would allow efficient daily commute use, but still have the engine and tank to take us anywhere on longer trips like we currently use her car or my truck (400-500 mile range) without having to deal with the range anxiety or charging times of a full EV. 

I'm learning to look past the MPGe number and look more closely at the specs, since MPGe is an average formula based on average driver use case scenario. 
Learning to ask: what is the MPG of the gas powertrain that will take us on longer trips, and what is the kWh/100 mile number.

Example a new Kia Sorento or Sportage PHEV have 31/34 miles of EV range respectively, and approx 34-36mpg gas, but a Mazda CX90 has 26 miles of battery range and only gets 26mpg gas. These are just a few PHEV models we have considered. 
Digging deeper, the kWh/100 mile ratings:
Kia Sportage PHEV 40
Kia Sorento PHEV 45
Mazda CX-90 PHEV 58

We do not currently have solar, it is in the future plans, so for now just paying straight PG&E rates on a tiered rate plan.",3710,True,1748550691.0,2025-05-29 22:31:31,2,51,keepcalmandcarryone,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kyld3i/new_vehicle_purchase_check_my_gaskwh_math_please/,True,0.57,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,
post,1kylja5,,"⚡ PSA: Can’t Adjust Your Tesla Wall Connector Settings Anymore? Here's How To Fix It (Gen 3, 2025 Method)","**TL;DR:**  
Tesla seems to have quietly killed the web setup process for Wall Connectors. If you're stuck with the “Download the Tesla One App” message at [192.168.92.1](http://192.168.92.1), stop wasting time. Download the *Tesla One* app, select “External Partner,” enter your Wall Connector serial manually, and use Setup Mode (blinking green) to reconfigure your unit.

\--

Alright Reddit — if you’re trying to reconfigure your Gen 3 Tesla Wall Connector (like resetting it or changing the breaker size), and all you’re getting is the “Tesla One App – Partner Access Only” screen at [`http://192.168.92.1`](http://192.168.92.1), here’s what actually worked for me after way too much trial and error. Tesla has changed how commissioning works, and most of the info online is now outdated.

# What You’ll Need:

* Tesla One App (not the regular Tesla app)
* Wall Connector serial number (usually on the back of the unit, behind the cover)
* A Tesla account (yes, even if you don’t own a Tesla)
* Your Wi-Fi password
* A little patience

# Steps to Reset or Recommission:

1. Download the **Tesla One App**
2. Choose **External Partner** when prompted
3. Log in or create a Tesla account
4. Tap: *Installs → Continue → Go to Home*
5. Tap **Begin Install**
6. Choose **Enter Connector Info Manually**
7. Type in your unit’s serial number
8. Put your Wall Connector into setup mode by holding the charging handle button for \~6 seconds until the LED blinks green
9. Tap **Join** when prompted
10. Follow the rest of the prompts:

* Set country
* Adjust breaker size (e.g., 50A sets output to 40A)
* Connect to Wi-Fi

# Quick Note:

I’m not an electrician — just a guy trying not to burn down the garage. My setup was wired to code for a 60A breaker, pulling 48A no problem. But during the county inspection, the inspector flagged it and made us swap to a 50A breaker due to some old local rule about cable length and attic heat.",2283,True,1748551103.0,2025-05-29 22:38:23,31,16,Temporary_Spinach_74,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kylja5/psa_cant_adjust_your_tesla_wall_connector/,True,0.85,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

4. We've had hybrids (Prius 2005), PHEVs (Chrysler Pacifica and BMW x5), and an EV (Y AWD LR) - For long trips the PHEV is the way to go. Even with Tesla charging stations you're going to add signficant time to your trip and there's no guarantee that the charging station is going to have services nearby...and if they do whether they'll be open.

Of the PHEVs we've driven the Hyunda Santa Fe was pretty nice. The Mazdas were a little rough...especially when the battery was run out. I think they need a bit more time to get them right. The Toyota Rav 4 and Lexus were both really nice. The Lexus TX was the nicest of all...including our BMW x5 45e.

Why do we own a Y...well, we needed a car and at the end of '24 Tesla was offering discounts, rebates, 0% financing, etc. that brought the effective  cost of the car down to around $30k. At that price there really wasn't anything that competes. However, on a 250-mile road trip the charging, waiting, etc.",1501,True,1748553628.0,2025-05-29 23:20:28,2,0,Positive_League_5534,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kyld3i/new_vehicle_purchase_check_my_gaskwh_math_please/muyg7u2/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,muyg7u2

comment,1kyld3i,1kyld3i,,"> As a side note, even though we don't want to deal with range anxiety, we notice regular EVs tend to have a far better efficiency rating in this sense. A Tesla Y is 27kWh/100 miles, meaning (at this special PG&E rate plan) our total cost for home charging would be 8.4 cents per mile.

This is not surprising given the specific vehicles you compared. You're looking at larger PHEVs which also are using inefficient parallel hybrid setup (as opposed to much more efficient power-split of Prius/Rav4 which I don't believe has been put in any larger PHEVs yet). And comparing them to Model Y which is smaller and made by a company that really worked hard to get their efficiency/range numbers up (through aerodynamics, an advanced hvac system, and some goofery with EPA test cycles)",780,False,1748554058.0,2025-05-29 23:27:38,2,0,iamtherussianspy,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kyld3i/new_vehicle_purchase_check_my_gaskwh_math_please/muyhn8u/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,muyhn8u

What if Tesla scraps every single unsold unit and stops making them and the foundation series in particular skyrockets in value to certain buyers. You never know.

I had the cash so paying 120k for the truck was not a big deal because I was okay with it and wanted it. I didn’t buy it for a future value I bought it because I liked it.

I will say I drive it daily and you are likely to run into haters still so if that is any indication they are doing their best to drive down the price. You can guess it will come down but again it doesn’t really change the fact that if you are okay with 70k for it then it doesn’t matter what it comes down to.

post,1kyrdrn,,Thinking of buying a used Tesla — need input from long-time owners,"I recently test drove a few Teslas and instantly fell in love. Like many others have said, it completely changes how you view driving.

As much as I’d love to get a brand-new model (especially after experiencing HW4), my current financial situation only allows me to consider something from around 2018–2022 — ideally a 2019 or 2020 model.

So I have a few questions for those of you who own older Teslas:
	1.	Do you regularly use FSD (Full Self-Driving), or is it not really up to par with HW4, making you take over more often?
	2.	How many miles do you have on your car?
	3.	Is the claim that Tesla batteries can last up to 500k miles actually holding up for anyone here?

I know jumping into this might seem impulsive, but the experience genuinely changed my perspective — and the money saved on gas and oil changes is very appealing.

Do you think it’s too early for me to switch now, or should I just wait until I can comfortably afford a new model in 1–2 years?

Appreciate any honest input from experienced owners!",1021,False,1748566862.0,2025-05-30 03:01:02,0,6,L3THO,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kyrdrn/thinking_of_buying_a_used_tesla_need_input_from/,True,0.5,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

comment,1kyrdrn,1kyrdrn,,"I bought a used one last year. The following factored in:

It felt like FSD was likely to get close in the next 12 months, but was considered almost without value in a used car, making it effectively free. 12 came out a couple months later and I felt validated LOL.

I work in auto and knew Tesla would either have to upgrade cars with insufficient hardware, repay the value, or make very attractive transfers to newer cars.

Once FSD unsupervised comes online, cost will skyrocket on both subscriptions and outright purchase.

Since buying, it's become clear that A) HW3 won't get there, and B) HW4 probably won't either. A transfer to AI5 is the move. Buying an non-depreciated HW4 car IMO is a pretty luxurious purchase.",723,False,1748567425.0,2025-05-30 03:10:25,1,0,Grandpas_Spells,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kyrdrn/thinking_of_buying_a_used_tesla_need_input_from/muzm7zs/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,muzm7zs

comment,1kz4q5u,1kz4q5u,,"I absolutely despise Elon and what he has come to represent - but there's no way around it, Tesla offers an amazing product. The best choice IMO is buying used.

comment,1kz4q5u,1kz4q5u,,The problem with this statement is most big corporations have some kind of greed behind them? Should we buy used iPhones? Used Nike clothing? No more Starbucks because they underpay labor for coffee pickings? We protest on some brands but look the other way on others.  Not trying to defend anyone here.

comment,1ky4x9y,1ky4x9y,,"I think the greater worry is that it’s been down for a year, not just since Trump’s executive order. There’s been a great runup so I think it’s reasonable to have an underperforming year. 

OP’s point is the news is still mostly positive yet the market is reacting like semiconductors are overvalued compared to the general market.",331,False,1748616018.0,2025-05-30 16:40:18,1,0,Thraex_Exile,investing,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ky4x9y/semis_not_recovering_despite_new_wave_of_ai/mv2ql63/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mv2ql63
