As this link references, in her biography *Tesla: Man Out of Time*, Margaret Cheney claimed Tesla was antisemitic saying he made an antisemitic comment to a secretary once. There doesn't appear to be any corroborating evidence of Tesla having any prejudice against Jewish people though with the small exception of Tesla making the offhand remark about Jewish people being part of a bad day in a context that suggests humor, irony or potentially even referencing someone else's joke obliquely. Tesla's secretary, George Scherff once made a very mild antisemitic joke in a telegram to Tesla apparently referencing Jewish lawyers being associated with charging high prices in relating Tesla's new Jewish lawyer required a prepaid retainer.

Unlike many American businessmen of the 1930s, Tesla never said anything positive about Hitler.

I don't know if it was the norm, but it was at least so much more common that it wasn't considered unusual. My point is that, Cheney's unsubstantiated doubtful claim aside, Tesla's lack of antisemitism was more significant than it would be today. He was born in the Austrian empire in 1856, which for historical context was 5 years before the US Civil War started, and despite his setting, he wasn't concerned about a Jewish financial conspiracy or stealing scientific accolades (Lenard's accusation) or whatever concerned racists.",569,False,1491074082.0,2017-04-01 21:14:42,3,0,dalkon,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/62o47n/was_tesla_antisemitic_a_look_at_his_humanitarian/dfpa0uq/,True,,2017,tesla,hot,False,False,0,dfpa0uq

comment,6erjqi,6erjqi,,"No, I don't. And quite frankly, I'm getting pretty tired of hearing that narrative.

First of all, let me say that I am pretty happy with my personal life. Me and my wife frequently go to the movies, hike the mountains, hang at the beach, visit museums and whatnot. I love to cook, play videogames, work out regularly, have many friends and occasionally get to drink copious amounts of beer. So although working at SpaceX can get rough from time to time, it's hardly fair to say that my life outside work sucks.

Nevertheless, working at SpaceX (and supposedly the same can be said for Tesla) can be extremely hard, challenging and stressful. Expectations are high, days are often long and I probably could get paid more elsewhere. So yeah, sure; I think it's fair to say that my job has affected my personal life quite a bit, and many of the horror stories you've heard are probably true, at least to some extent. But I truly detest the idea that Elon is some sort of slave-master, exploiting young souls under dangerous and unhealthy working conditions at sub-par wages, all so he can line his pockets with profits. That is just pure bullshit.

Naturally, working at SpaceX will not be for everyone.

comment,7e2ze2,7e2ze2,,"Bugatti hasn’t even attempted top speed in their car yet. The 261 is just what they limit the car to right now for their customers.

Everyone knows it will be 280mph+, the question is can they find new tires that let them reach 300.

If you read Motor Trend’s review of the Chiron, they said a $180k Turbo S would accelerate as fast in 0-60, but the Chiron feels to accelerate faster from 60-180mph than it does 0-60, that’s where most of the power delivery is.

It’s odd that Tesla only bragged about 0-60 and 0-100mph numbers, for most hyper cars that aim for 250mph+ top speed, they brag about 0-124, 60-150, or 0-200mph time, that’s where the differences lie. 

Actually they mostly brag about lap times around the Nurburgring, since that’s a better indicator of the overall performance of a vehicle.  

One big concern with EV in this context is that due to the nature of EV, a powerful car would require a big battery pack, and current battery technology means it will be a very heavy battery pack. Weight is public enemy number one as far as motor sport engineering is concerned, so the Roadster's track performance is still a big question mark at this point. I personally think if they solve the battery cooling issue, it should be very respectable, but very, very unlikely to be record setting considering some of the [bat shit insane stuff](https://jalopnik.com/the-1000-horsepower-mercedes-amg-project-one-this-is-1803141648) that's coming out right around the same time.",1975,True,1511124011.0,2017-11-19 21:40:11,2668,0,cookingboy,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7e2ze2/tesla_vs_bugatti/dq24dq8/,True,,2017,tesla,top,False,False,0,dq24dq8

comment,7frfq1,7frfq1,,"[My Inventions](http://www.tfcbooks.com/special/my_inventions_index.htm) is his 1919 autobiography serialized in one of Gernsback's electronics magazines. It's very short. 

*[Prodigal Genius: The Life of Nikola Tesla](http://books.google.com/books?id=40NzjS5FunkC&pg=PP8)* (1944) was written by a science journalist who personally knew Tesla and praised him highly. 

*[Wizard: The Life And Times Of Nikola Tesla](http://books.google.com/books?id=DzMR8x_rbPgC&pg=PT6)* (1996) is longer and more detailed. It's probably the best Tesla bio.

If you dislike Tesla, you might like Margaret Cheney's *Tesla: Man Out of Time* (1981) or Bernard Carlson's *Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age* (2013). They don't like him and don't understand anything technical, so they misunderstand and misrepresent a lot. ^* In writing her book, Cheney consulted with people who understood various aspects of Tesla's ideas like Leland Anderson, so it's a blend of understanding and confusion. It credits Tesla for certain things inaccurately, but fails to credit him for most of what he did. Carlson previously wrote a biography of Elihu Thomson, and his Tesla bio basically calls Tesla a second-rate Elihu Thomson.

I don’t wanna sound like a nay-sayer because I’m far from that, but i also don’t want to fall in the trap of being a blind fan. 

Edit: 

There's been a few replies to this comment and another comment about my ""cautiously optimistic"" statement. I'll try to reply to those comments as well but I wanted to add an edit here to get ahead of the ""you're wrong"" replies. 

My comment here is not meant to say that Tesla will not fulfill their promise, nor am I trying to argue that Tesla is not currently in a good situation. I'm just addressing the comment that the Semi will put Tesla in a good situation. I believe the Semi **can** put Tesla in a good situation but as of right now, it can't do much other than fuel the hype. There are no Tesla's on the road transporting goods, or even Tesla semis in production, it's simply a POC right now and trying to shake up the industry. 

So again, I'll reiterate what my comment was originally trying to say. The Semi *can* be a big deal, the Semi *can* become a game-changer, the Semi *can* put Tesla in a good situation, but as of December 19 2017, the Tesla Semi is simply just another proof of concept similar to the [Nikola Corp](https://nikolamotor.com/one) electric semi.",1402,False,1513693981.0,2017-12-19 15:33:01,611,0,Ragnar_Targaryen,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7ktg18/ups_preorders_125_tesla_electric_trucks/drh09ma/,True,,2017,tesla,top,False,False,0,drh09ma
comment,7ktg18,7ktg18,,"Most UPS semi trucks drive 4 hours one-way, swap trailers with another truck, then drive back to where they started. Assuming the trucks are driving 65mph they should just barely be able to do that with a single charge. And every minute counts with these big couriers. If a trailer can arrive at it's destination just 10 minutes earlier due to the extra power uphills, the benefits can trickle all the way down the entire supply chain allowing them to offer more competitive services than other couriers, saving entire days on international shipments, allowing stricter commit times to rural destinations, or avoiding mid-day meetups for the bottom-rung drivers.

post,7ln3tt,,"Tesla's Death Ray: A Murder Declassified, starting on Discovery Channel Jan. 2","A bit cringy since the engineer says ""Tesla called it his death ray"". Actually, it was the news that started calling it a Death Ray and it really annoyed Tesla, because it wasn't a Ray. It was a charged particle beam weapon.  
  
The series is going to cover that time in the late 1930's when Tesla was writing multiple leaders of the nations heading to World War II, saying his particle beam weapon could prevent the war. He offered to travel to the countries and would build the defense system in their country. He was in negotiations with Neville Chamberlain until Chamberlain suddenly cut off all correspondence with him. After that Tesla got an offer from Russia and did travel there, doing something. This series is saying Tesla had a network of laboratories across Europe and they are going to be excavating them.  
  
While Tesla was 83 and frail, he wasn't ill and showed no signs of illness when he was last seen by the hotel staff. There was some suspicion at the time of his death that he was murdered.  
  
They are showing documents that were never published, possibly in Croatia. The engineer is going to try to build the particle beam weapon from Tesla's description in his letters.

comment,7ln3tt,7ln3tt,,"Tesla's defensive weapon particle accelerator was supposed to be a mercury ion particle accelerator powered by a turbine electrostatic generator. http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1935-00-00.htm 

Alfred W. Simon patented what looks like Tesla's turbine-powered electrostatic generator in 1933. https://www.google.com/patents/US2004352

Tesla's beam weapon idea could possibly also have been an adapted form of wireless power transmission beam or plasma column.

Here are some other links about directed energy weapons.

comment,81xi87,81xi87,,"Your comment had me wondering, how expensive is it really? Obviously the Tesla's are luxury priced, but then again isn't Europe the place where people get taxi'ed in Mercedes? Can the alledged lower running costs of a Tesla Model S make up the cost difference? I dug around and found this

According to [this source](https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/Netherlands/diesel_prices/), the average diesel price in the Netherlands for the past few months has been 1,27 euros per liter, that's $5.9/gallon. Gasoline is even worse, 1.55 euros per liter or $7.22/gallon, but for the sake of the argument let's go with diesel.

According to [this source](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/8/8c/Electricity_prices%2C_first_half_of_year%2C_2015-2017.png), the average **household** price of a kWh of energy in the Netherlands in the 1st semester of last year was 0.156 euros per kWh, non-household is considerably lower, but let's go with worst case scenario.

The first Model S seen in the picture has a 85 kWh battery, according [to this source](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=32557) to be good enough for 265 miles, or 426 km. But let's go with 400 km to round it down, that's 4.7 km per kWh

Now let's find a comparable car to match the Tesla against.

comment,8c91bd,8c91bd,,"In 1901, the ""universe"" was the known Solar System, Neptune only recently discovered and Pluto not until the 1930's. The idea of planets around other stars was thought to be outlandish in the science community until the 1940's.  
  
This is interesting considering, in 2018, over 3,000 exoplanets have now been found, several imaged directly. These have been mostly gas giants but the era of finding thousands of small, rocky inner exoplanets is only just starting.  
  
Tesla did go into showman mode during these interviews, so his terminology needs to be understood. He was talking about detecting signals from more than 20 planets, meaning exoplanets. He never claimed to have had two-way communication, he only detected what he thought were communications between these exoplanets. It could be that he was detecting pulsars and not knowing what they were, thought they were communications between star systems.    
  
These are a few areas out of his Colorado Spring testing results that don't get covered because they have been too fringe, until now. He was talking about frequencies up to 10^24 cycles per second. Gamma ray telescopes, which had a Top Secret reason in the 1970's for happening, are now used to monitor stellar events, 10^19 cycles per second.  
  
Also, Tesla said he was able to summon ball lightning at will. This is cold plasma that is still a major mystery to physics.

comment,8c91bd,8c91bd,,"This paper provides relevant context [Nikola Tesla and the planetary radio signals](http://www.teslasociety.com/mars.pdf). Additional context shows Tesla must have misinterpreted signals from the Jupiter-Io natural radio that include incremental pulses from 1 to 3 or 4 (that his early [VLF pulse envelope methods](http://www.teslasociety.com/teslarec.pdf) would have received) as a sign of intelligence. Jupiter and Mars were close enough in the sky at the time that he mistook one for the other. Unlike Tesla, now we know how that signal is produced and that it is a natural phenomenon that Jupiter and also Saturn can produce that does not indicate an intelligent source.

The additional context raises interesting questions. Was Tesla building ever more powerful radio transmitters in an attempt to communicate with his misinterpreted sign of intelligence? It seems like that may have been the case. His pre-1910 quenched gap radio transmitters were so powerful that quenched gap radio transmitters were banned entirely as one of the first radio regulations. One of Tesla's solutions to the problem of the extreme spectrum limitation imposed by everyone using global-strength radio transmitters was to use complex automatically varied modulation with multiple signals on multiple antennas.

Of course I would complain about the focus being on the War of the Currents period, which was in the 1880s, when everything he did subsequently was a lot more interesting: resonant power transmission, solar energy, cosmic ray energy, x-rays, radioactivity, radio astronomy, wireless power, energy beams for wireless power, robots, electric cars, flying machines and everything else he worked with. Unfortunately much less is known about those later inventions though, so it would be difficult.

Because a movie about his later period is still waiting for someone to write a book about it let alone a screenplay, a book or movie about the group of inventors affiliated with him who were known as ""the Philadelphia crowd"" might be interesting: Harry Shoemaker, Gustav Gehring, Cornelius Ehret, et al.

One inventor affiliated with Tesla already did have a series of successful children's fiction based on him, although not many people know that he was in fact affiliated with Tesla. John Hays Hammond, Jr. was supposed to have inspired Jonny Quest, the 1960s children's animation.

In regards to his later years that you mentioned; yes, that would be one amazing aspect to work on, however then it would steer more towards sci-fiction as we simply do not have access to documentation proving what most of us believe to have taken place. The purpose of this movie is to educated while entertaining, and we've found a way around the dry and boring aspects to keep our audience engaged.

Tesla had laboratories all over New York, which he was eventually kicked out of for not paying the rent. In the 1930's, he ended up at the Hotel New Yorker where he also had laboratories on a few floors.  
  
Since Tesla was robbed from continuously after Wardenclyffe, he became much more secretive about what he was working on. In a later interview, he mentioned he had 80 large steamer trunks with his research papers. After his death, 50 were found and turned over to the Belgrade museum. That left the question of where the lost trunks went and what was in them. That is what the new series is focused on. They are finding out many things about the New Yorker. It is the same height as the Wardenclyffe tower and had mysterious changes made to its architecture not long before Tesla moved in.

Yes, because the physics of it are fundamentally and unchangeably inefficient.  Power deceases by the square of the distance.  Not to mention that pumping that much electrical energy into the air would turn practically every exposed peice of metal into a live wire.

Intel can't fix that, either.  What they're trying to do is direct beams towards whatever it is they're trying to power, instead of transmitting in all directions.

It has taken over 100 years to find out Wardenclyffe wasn't a Tesla coil, and was not for transmitting power through air. The power was coming out of the air and being transmitted deep underground.

comment,9f7g4b,9f7g4b,,">Wait, what?  Software locked battery capacity?Why would they sell the car with extra battery cells?

It's not that the car has extra battery cells, is that they limit the charge capacity of each cell to improve durability. A battery cell that is constantly charged to 100% will degrade faster than a cell charged at say, 80%. All your Li-ion battery devices do the same as to increase the number of cycles the battery will last.

In this case, Tesla is saying, ""well, if you are dead those extra cycles of charge will be of no use to you, so go ahead and be safe at the impact of a minor degradation to your battery pack",632,False,1536759217.0,2018-09-12 15:33:37,115,0,sircrovax,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9f7g4b/tesla_enabling_free_supercharging_for_anyone_in/e5uce3f/,True,,2018,tesla,top,False,False,0,e5uce3f

Would be able to add capacity to the supercharger network very quickly. Would originally assist with evacuation.

Seems I didn't describe the situation clearly and some are getting fussy and making incorrect assumptions.

I think it's too bad that you are not getting the support you want. However, I think the answer to why this is happening is hidden in this reply right here. It may well be that Tesla (or their advisers) have come to the conclusion that if they start creating solutions for the Turkish market, the will have ""entered that market"", and therefore be obliged to provide additional support to Turkish Tesla owners, follow specific Turkish regulations etc. 

In other words, fixing a small issue in relation to Turkey might bring other consequences with it for the company. Not saying I agree with that stance, and of course I think it'd be really good if Tesla entered all markets to help move everyone to a sustainable mode of transport, but it may be the explanation.

Moray's new nuclear technology has confused a lot of people over the years because for a long time he used an antenna to generate power by amplifying an ambient noise signal. That lead many to believe that he must be receiving a large amount of radio power somehow. The way that he talked about receiving energy in his book contributed to that misunderstanding.

Instead of receiving a huge amount of radio energy, which is impossible, his device worked by converting mass to particle energy in some nuclear reaction and then converting particle energy into electric charge. The radio noise input might not be anything besides a convenient arbitrary AC signal to amplify. The way that Moray said that it received external power appears to have been related to Tesla's theory that radioactivity is caused by some external radiation disturbing the mass energy in radioactive matter. (edit: And it really only obfuscates the simple way that we can understand how the device worked.)

Moray's patent on his technology shows tube designs that Tesla first displayed in his 1897 lecture about vacuum tubes. The timing of this patent is kind of interesting too.

Moray doesn't appear to have stolen anything from Tesla. Tesla shared it with him. And Moray was hardly the only one. Tesla gave revolutionary energy technology away to many inventors over his lifetime.

comment,b4f7mf,b4f7mf,,"George Westinghouse, Jr. was a Civil War veteran whose older brother died in that war. Unlike other leading businessmen of his time, he was agreeable. He worked well with others and treated his employees very well. Tesla always had the highest regard for Westinghouse. Where Edison happily used patent trolling to arrest technological progress for personal profit, Westinghouse could appreciate the value in technological progress benefiting us all.

Westinghouse's personal inventions were mostly related to train safety to prevent the deadliest form of traffic accidents of his time and eliminate the need for a dangerous job they said killed 5,000 men in a bad year—and when that was a much larger proportion of the population than it is now.

Westinghouse only owned Westinghouse Electric for 21 years after starting it in 1886. In 1907, when the powerful bankers squeezed the credit markets in another panic, his large debts for global expansion cost him the company. GE and Westinghouse have presumably been owned by the same people since then. Edison lost the War of the Currents after 1893, but Morgan still won control of Westinghouse's company 14 years later.

There are several aspects to the mercenary corporation but the main one is the workers, and their intellectual property, are owned by the corporation.  
  
Westinghouse also invented a corporation but it was a more benevolent corporation, where the workers were more like a family, growing the corporation while the corporation took care of the workers and their families. It never caught on and died out with the passing of Westinghouse.    
  
Anyway, it is too late. What's done is done. We are all living in the Henry Ford - internal combustion engine, Thomas Edison - metered electric utilities and mercenary corporations, J.P. Morgan - utility and corporate vulture banking, and  Albert Einstein - matter before energy. In this timeline, the CO2 and CH4 emissions from ICE (internal combustion engines) for all transportation and farming, and corporate scale farming and cattle ranch clearing of forests, is starting to increase geometrically. The Point Of No Return (PONR) is around 2040, when Zero Emissions must be achieved. This isn't going to happen.

comment,c0bt9b,c0bt9b,,"This is the other Tesla coil and coil winding method that time seems to have forgotten about because it was overshadowed by the iconic high voltage Tesla coil. This is essentially the idea of using the distributed capacitance of a coil and especially using distributed capacitance to move current through a coil without normal impedance. Neutralizing impedance increases quality factor, increases the peak magnetic field strength of current, and can be used to widely broaden the bandwidth of resonance (at least with two conductors or with more conductors or sections the resonant bandwidth can be sharper for better filtering). 

The leftmost inventions show preceding ideas where two coils in proximity are wound oppositely. That is kind of similar but it's not the same idea. And before Elihu Thomson patented that as a lightning transient filter, Charles J. Van Depoele patented that slightly different winding for use on a motor in the 1880s. 

Richard Varley patented the idea in Canada for an induction coil in 1892, the year before Tesla patented it in the US, but Tesla once said ""the Varley coil"" was his idea. In fact if I'm remembering correctly, Tesla said Roentgen was using an induction coil he got from Varley when Roentgen discovered x-rays. 

""The Varley coil"" as it's described later is an x-ray transformer a little different from the 1892 patent.

This is not a classic IPO, but a “direct listing,” also known a “direct public offering.” This means Slack is not raising money by directly selling shares and instead allows early investors and employees to sell their shares in the public offering. Music streaming service Spotify held a successful direct listing last year.

This story caught my attention for a simple reason. In August 2016, I joined the team developing a still-undercover product called Workplace by Facebook—a direct competitor to Slack. I worked on the product for 2.5 years. Back then, I dreamed of having an opportunity to look inside Slack’s business metrics.

It may seem that Slack has revealed a lot of data about the business in their [S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019004786/slacks-1.htm#sA031AD7407DEE4C9AD8C567D8A577EE8), a document that is almost 200 pages in length.

The reality is, they haven’t. The company had already disclosed in various ways much of the information compiled in their report.

But if we combine the data disclosed in S-1 filing and the experience I gained while working on Slack’s competitor, we’ll be able to uncover interesting details that will paint a more holistic picture.

I must say that this article contains my personal thoughts on the matter, jotted down while going through their S-1 filing, and should not be considered as investment advice.

The flat coil winding that Tesla developed was unlike anything before because it only works with High Voltage High Frequency Alternating Current. Tesla was not the inventor of AC but he most certainly was the inventor of High Voltage High Frequency Alternating Current (HVHFAC).  
  
Tesla claimed he visualized his designs on the back of his head, in a 2-inch square box, completely finished. He completely designed the entire electrical power grid, even to the point of using aluminum wire for the HVHFAC power transmission, down to every component. But, as soon as he was done with that, he basically saw it as obsolete, and developed the wireless transmission of electric power. There is massive historical confusion there. Wardenclyffe was not a Tesla coil, although it had one in it to act as a ""pump"", it was an electric energy harvester, and the power transmission was through the ground. He demonstrated the use of the flat winding resonant coil to the US Patent Office, with a working model. This air transmission of electric power is a different method, but Tesla said it would send large amounts of power around the globe, as easy as he was demonstrating to the patent office.

comment,c0bt9b,c0bt9b,,"> Tesla didn't invent coil windings, that was Oersted that did that. 

Oersted discovered the magnetic field of current and that looping wire increased the magnetic field, but he's not associated with any particular winding or coil, is he? 

Maxwell and Helmholtz invented certain coils that bear their names. Both their coils are designed to produce a uniform field within an interior space.

Tesla patented a coil winding for electromagnets in 1893 using multiple windings or multifilar wire wound in parallel and wired in series, [US512340](https://patents.google.com/patent/US512340). And that is the idea all these inventions except Thomson's share. 

And as I wrote in the previous comment, I believe at some point he said the Varley coil first patented in Canada in 1892 was also his idea. The Varley coil is the same idea in the form of a multifilar solenoid induction coil, which Tesla mentioned in his patent. People patenting Tesla's ideas for ignition coils and magnetos for internal combustion engines include Richard Varley, Richard Cunningham, James Seeley, Leon Jules Le Pontois, George H. Ennis, Frank Conrad, Edward B. Jacobson, John Heany, August R Luschka, Justus Entz, Harold P. Donle, Homer C. Snook, Alfons H. Neuland, Vincent G. Apple, Arthur Atwater Kent and Charles Kettering. Kettering is usually credited for inventing spark ignition, but Tesla patented disruptive discharge ignition 10 years before him.

comment,davluw,davluw,,"I doubt a decent compressed air engine can be 3D printed.

This video seemed to imply Tesla only produced one reciprocating steam/air engine patent, but he produced several. One purpose of his reciprocating engines was to produce sinusoidal high frequency AC for lighting, wireless signaling and wireless power transmission. Another purpose was to produce a clock timing device. Another purpose was apparently to produce a vibrating engine for powering a shaking table for processing mining ores. A shaking table prototype is apparently the device that made Mark Twain suddenly need to use the bathroom in that one story. 

The way that the reciprocating engine worked as an earthquake machine is also very interesting. As Tesla described it, it was designed to operate with so little friction that it could respond to the minute sympathetic vibration of the structure to which it was attached, so it would begin oscillating at a very, very low rate and only speed up as the vibration built up in the attached object.

comment,dij9tx,dij9tx,,"Tesla said he originally thought of his bladeless turbine idea as a pump for pumping mercury while he was working for Edison in 1884. Edison's vacuum light bulbs were made using a mercury-column vacuum pump.

Geissler had used a mercury-column vacuum pump that was later named a [Sprengel pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprengel_pump) to make his discharge tubes.

William Crookes made his own copies of Geissler's tubes to study them to discover that while electrified, the gas inside was a different state of matter that he termed radiant matter in his 1879 treatise. Today we call Crooke's radiant matter plasma.

Crookes's experiments inspired Joseph Swan to invent the carbon filament vacuum incandescent light bulb. Edison copied Swan's idea from a scientific magazine and falsely claimed it as his own original invention.

Edison committed intellectual property theft like this repeatedly. He was an unscrupulous man devoid of honor, but he was wealthy enough to buy journalists to say what he wanted people to think about him and project the false image of himself as legendary that the poorly-informed majority of people still believe today.

Edison didn't invent the light bulb, he stole the idea, but he did mass produce it to sell at a lower price than Swan. As he achieved great financial success, he improved on Swan's idea. He used a stronger vacuum pump, so the bulbs lasted longer. He produced a stronger vacuum by using a vacuum pump with a taller column of mercury.",2213,True,1571718796.0,2019-10-22 06:33:16,3,0,dalkon,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/dij9tx/so_i_built_this_tesla_turbine/f4p7tq8/,True,,2019,tesla,top,False,False,0,f4p7tq8

comment,epf1o0,epf1o0,,"You're making assumptions instead of reading original sources to learn what Tesla was talking about. Tesla repeatedly said that his wireless power methods didn't use radio waves. He agreed the inverse square law dispersion of radio waves made it impossible to use radiated waves to transmit power efficiently over meaningful distances. It is apparently possible to transmit large amounts of power over distances of up to about one mile with low frequency radio waves, but the efficiency is low. Surface waves are more efficient than radio waves because they only disperse in two dimensions instead of three, but the methods Tesla intended to use were non-dispersive.

Tesla had multiple efficient wireless power transmission systems. One method used plasma columns or filaments to transmit power through the air and the other method transmitted current through the earth as a rotating magnetic field. 

Daniel Watts Troy and August Kloneck patented the lower efficiency radio wave and surface wave methods. John Hettinger and Conrad Reno patented wireless power transmission by plasma conductors. And Charles Roe patented the earth current method. I've posted the patents here before.

Tesla said Hettinger's idea of using UV light to create the plasma conductor wouldn't work because it was too easily affected by wind.

The link below is one of the illustration's accompanying Tesla's articles in the Electrical Experimenter in 1919, which were drawn to his descriptions. Notice, there are no Tesla coil sparks from the hemisphere, which people have erroneously drawn-in over the years, equating them to wireless power transmitted through Hertzian waves (which doesn't work). Tesla described the Wardenclyffe tower as glowing, as well as those who witnessed it being tested at Shoreham in 1903. The only thing going to Shoreham in 1903 was the railroad and Thomas Edison would not run Edison Electric there until 1910. Yet, people living near Shoreham saw the glowing of the Wardenclyffe tower over the years from 1903 to 1907.

comment,ftf878,ftf878,,"Tesla obtained several patents on reciprocating engines and engine-generators, which is what his mechanical oscillators were.  
・[Tesla reciprocating generator 1893 US511916](https://patents.google.com/patent/US511916)  
・[Tesla reciprocating engine 1893 US514169](https://patents.google.com/patent/US514169)  
・[Tesla reciprocating engine 1894 US517900](https://patents.google.com/patent/US517900)  

The main idea of the invention was reducing a steam engine and dynamo combination to the least complicated form possible by using reciprocating linear motion instead of rotary motion. Tesla said he used it to power the lights in his lab for a number of years after inventing it.

https://teslaresearch.jimdofree.com/oscilators/mechanical-oscilator/  
https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/articles/teslas-oscillator

As I understand it, the main concept behind using a mechanical oscillator to cause destructive mechanical resonance—which Tesla would later say could be used to demolish a building—is active friction reduction so the oscillator responds to the extremely feint sympathetic vibration that it creates in the object it vibrates.

---

Tesla did more with his reciprocating engines than I first remembered. He said it's possible to use a reciprocating engine to transmit vibrational energy through the ground for a mechanical form of wireless power transmission, and he pointed to great possibilities for using them for prospecting. He called this work the art of telegeodynamics.

The first quote sounds like something Tesla could have said because he did point to the continuous spectrum of perceivable vibration from subsonic to sound to radio to heat to visible light and then ionizing light beyond that. Sound is physical vibration while light is electric, but they are all vibrations. And our thoughts and feelings are subtle electric vibrations within us.

comment,gv6tjx,gv6tjx,,"To correct a small point in this, Tesla didn't think Marconi could signal across the Atlantic using only the single-tuned circuit radio transmitter and receiver that Marconi had patented, which is accurate. Marconi had to use Tesla's four-circuit system to succeed. The four-circuit/multi-stage resonance concept is necessary for sharp tuning at the transmitter and selective tuning at the receiver. Without the multi-stage resonant circuit concept, it requires impossibly huge amounts of power to overcome noise. 

Tesla first patented the two-stage resonant oscillator in 1896 ([US568178](https://www.google.com/patent/US568178)). He subsequently patented its use specifically for single-wire power transmission in 1897 ([US593138](https://www.google.com/patent/US593138)) and in 1899, surface wave power transmission and high-altitude plasma power transmission ([US649621](https://www.google.com/patent/US649621), [US645576](https://www.google.com/patent/US645576)). 

John Stone Stone patented the circuit for radio and he credited Tesla as the originator of the concept. 

Marconi used the four-circuit concept in violation of Tesla's patents, which was what the Supreme Court decided in 1943. http://www.mercurians.org/1999_Spring/rereading.htm

Unfortunately, they didn't know that Marconi was lying; that he'd been using Tesla's ""unproven"" ideas in order to broadcast across the Atlantic.   Soon Marconi company was selling Tesla coils, even selling Tesla's ""Extra Coil"" or ""magnifier.""   But he called them ""oscillation transformers"" and ""loading coils.""

Another bit: William Preece of the UK govt. was working with Marconi, and they range-tested the Tesla transmitter.  They found that its range far exceeded Marconi's patented transmitter invention.  Preece insisted that Marconi license Tesla's technology.  Marconi refused.   Then (by pure coincidence?) Preece and the UK government suddenly broke ties to Marconi.  Why?  It's a mystery.  Marconi had to scramble to create a new company.

A couple of online history articles say that the UK suddenly dropped Marconi because of Marconi's overtly-planned idea-theft of Tesla's technology.

People are comparing them to pets.com, but I don’t think even that company was this blatant at ripping investors off. Their “quarterly report” might as well have been a fat middle finger to both their investors and the SEC.

Oh btw the company is worth around $15B... and some analysts are saying it’s a “buying opportunity” given today’s dip.

**Edit**: for more context on the Pets.com comparison:

Pets.com had annual revenue of $619k for first year, and reached a market cap of $400M at its highest. Crazy bubble right?

Well Nikola has annual revenue of less than $100k (maybe a bit more depends on how many more solar panels the CEO is gonna order for his houses lmao), but reached market cap of $30B at its highest.

It’s literally 500 times more overvalued than the most infamous bubble stock during the dotcom crisis.

**Edit 2**: For the people who argue how revenue doesn't matter because they are the next Tesla.

For comparison. Tesla was founded in 2003 and 5 years later the original Tesla Roadster was on sale. They didn't go IPO until 2 years after that. Elon Musk also had a decent track record, being a co-founder and CEO of this small startup called PayPal.

Meanwhile Nikola Motors was founded in 2004, by a businessman with no real education whose resume is ""fluffy"" at best, and their six years of ""industry leading product development"" has yielded some fantastic CG renderings. 

Can Nikola be the next Tesla? Never say never, especially in the year 2020. But my bet is that Trevor Milton is closer to Elizabeth Holmes than Elon Musk.

comment,i83fts,i83fts,,"Tesla or possibly Hugo Gernsback commissioned this sketch. ~~It appears to depict some type of plasma beams connecting to the ground or upper atmosphere from the power receivers. Tesla said that transmitting power by at least one of his wireless power methods would create an artificial aurora in the vicinity of the power receiver. Where this sketch shows beams with straight edges, they might really be more like snaking plasma streamers.~~ People who lived in the neighborhood of his Long Island tower said it made incredible light shows at night.

The title of this post says it uses radio waves, but that's incorrect. It's easy to tell if someone doesn't know what they're talking about if they say Tesla wanted to transmit power by radio waves. Tesla repeatedly said radio waves couldn't transmit power efficiently because they are too dispersive. He had at least two wireless methods: point-to-point plasma conductors and surface waves. The method depicted here might be a hybrid of the two. He patented point-to-point plasma power transmission in 1897 (US645576) and surface wave power transmission in 1900 (US649621).

Books are disappointing too. None of the many biographies of him has covered his business, which was selling inventions to other inventors. No one has told that story yet, so it's very unlikely this film would. 

The villains of Tesla's story at least up to around 1915 are J.P. Morgan (first and foremost), Thomas Edison, Mihajlo Pupin, Elihu Thomson and Guglielmo Marconi. And they are heroes to too many other people, so it's unlikely the true story about what they did to Tesla will be told. 

J.P. Morgan caused the Panic of 1907 by spreading rumors about the Knickerbocker Trust (a large bank) in order to take control of Westinghouse Electric after Westinghouse refused to sell his company to him. Morgan already owned General Electric, and his business model was monopoly. 

The real story of Tesla is also not quite as tragic as biographies relate. For a long time, he earned a good income selling inventions.

comment,i83fts,i83fts,,"The illustration is from Radio News 1925. The artist illustration was done for Nikola Tesla, with his descriptions of the electric aircraft. He had gone bankrupt in 1907, but was still thinking about what could have been in 1925, if he had been able to finish Wardenclyffe.    
  
Lightning is DC, direct current. Lightning bolts are due to direct current.  
  
The sparks from a Tesla coil are not DC, they are AC, alternating current at a very high voltage and high frequency.  
  
Tesla's Wardenclyffe tower was not a Tesla coil (flyback transformer) although it did have one inside that acted as a pump. The Wardenclyffe tower didn't have giant sparks, it was illuminated by the pulsing glow of ionized air. What Tesla was doing was ""pumping"" the static E-field into oscillation, like continuously throwing rocks in the middle of a pond, at a very high frequency.

comment,icyycl,icyycl,,"It’s made by Michael Almereyda, a David Lynch disciple who Lynch once called America’s Best New Wave director. All that’s to say I think this film is best judged through the lens of him and his work as an artist than through the lens of historical accuracy or really anything to do with Tesla. This is simply one man’s take and he focuses on the parts of the story that he wants to focus on that suit his themes. As fans of Tesla I would warn anyone interested in this movie that it is not really a movie about Tesla and instead a movie about legendary people, how their legendary status effects the lens through which we view them and how those people have been represented through cinema’s history. It’s definitely more of a dissection of the Biopic genre than anything. There’s a reason film critics have overall enjoyed it, metacritic shows no negative reviews at the time of me writing this and fans of Tesla, history or good ole fashioned summer entertainment have been savaging it. It is a film about our relationship with people worthy of Biopics and the Biopics made about them.

comment,ikcdb7,ikcdb7,,"Tesla's last patent is for a VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) biplane in 1928.  
  
He did talk about communicating with other planets (noting he left out any reference to planets in this stellar system but thought they were from the direction of Mars).  
1901: http://www.teslacollection.com/tesla_articles/1901/colorado_springs_gazette/nikola_tesla/nikola_tesla_and_his_talk_with_other_worlds  
  
He never filed patents for any disk aircraft. However, he spoke about an Electric Stratocruiser in 1911, along with a 3-view sketch, no wings, no propellers, later, in 1925 and the illustration of it is in the upper right corner of the magazine issue cover art. That is not a dirigible or blimp. That is an Electric Stratocruiser hovering, and it could then go supersonic once reaching the stratosphere. No batteries but did need operating energy harvester towers producing high voltage, high frequency energy waves in the Earth's electric field. 
The link below appears to be the original sketch he did for his interview during 1911. As everybody knows the lore, Tesla could hand draw extremely detailed engineering drawings but they were all the size of a large postage stamp, with his explanation that was how he saw things and the only way he could bring them out. He had a lifelong partnership with a machinist and mechanical engineer, and he is the one that did all the final drawings and model building.

Tesla kept a safe in his room. He was dead for 3 days before the hotel maid found him, because he had put a Do Not Disturb sign on his door. Tesla would not have done this, because he required a huge stack of linens each morning. Neither she or the hotel clerk noticed if the safe was open or not. The hotel clerk immediately informed the FBI of Tesla's death, since he was under FBI surveillance, and there were 2 FBI agents living on the same floor. The FBI says when they entered his room, the safe was already opened. The story is the hotel informed Tesla's nearest next of kin, his nephew, of his death, and the nephew hired a locksmith to open the safe. The nephew said the safe was already open and he had hired the locksmith to change the lock.    
  
The FBI chose Dr. John Trump to go through all the trunks they had collected. John Trump wrote a summary at the end, with the conclusion being ""nothing of significance and mostly self-serving and promotional material"".

There were also random pieces of rubber glued on because they couldn't identify the source of leaks. Not to mention how Tesla quietly swaps out entire motors and drivetrain components without consumer being made aware of it during routine physical service or updates. They don't even actually know whether their cars are reliable or not, all of this is very bad).

post,j59ovh,,So Tesla's quality control is embarrassingly bad. Our brand new model Y's roof just fell off,"My dad bought a brand new model Y today, and he brought me along to pick it up just in case he needed help with any tech problems. Everything was going fine and we were driving back home when we started to hear a ton of wind. I thought maybe a window was open but a minute later the entire glass roof just blew off. After a brief panic we turned around and drove the new Tesla convertible back to the dealership.

When we got back we called highway patrol to tell them that there was a car roof somewhere on the 580, but somebody might have gotten into an accident, I’m not sure. The manager at the dealership said that either the seal for the roof was faulty, or the factory just ... forgot to seal the roof on? I can’t imagine how something as big as the roof not being attached could make it past quality control. If this is a recurring problem a lot of people could get hurt. Has this ever happened before?

&#x200B;

Edit: The manager offered to get the car serviced for free, but we declined and are probably going to get an entirely new car. Whether we're still getting a Tesla is up to my dad but probably not.

comment,k2g3aq,k2g3aq,,"All I said was no, this is not better than a stock paint job. 

In my opinion, Tesla paint is not “crap”. There’s irregularities from a QC standpoint, so 1 out of every X vehicles might have uneven paint applied, or something along those lines. The rarity of that variable for X is probably much higher than you would be lead to believe. Although it might not be on par with the rest of the auto industry on average, and some customers are justifiably upset, the vast majority of owners probably don’t think twice about it, and experience no issues. I know 3 people who own model 3’s, all for 2+ years. Their paint looks great, nothing off about it, and they have no complaints. So, the upset minority speaks the loudest, and over-represents these types of issues. I’m not saying it isn’t an issue, people should expect better QC on the whole when purchasing a $50K car. But it isn’t crap, it’s just not their strong suite.

Is this not what the original Tesla was? They took pre-manufactured Lotus Elise car frames and put electric motors in. It's obviously not simple to source the parts or make the car as a whole to sell, but they were not building cars from the ground up in the beginning.

post,l3z5jq,,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

I'm sure someone will correct me quickly enough if I'm wrong (the fastest way to find something out on the internet: say it wrong, and someone will rapidly scream at you how much of an idiot you are)

Unfortunately there's no nice easy ""story time"" analogy like short selling to help explain it super simply. But Puts and Calls are fairly easy concepts anyway, with ways to over-complicate them. The simple version, in both cases, is you're paying a premium/fee now, in order to be able to buy (call) or sell (put) at a fixed price in future.

You pay the fee either way, and it's non-refundable. In return, you are given an ""option"" (choice) of whether you want to execute your put/call in future. That's where the name ""Option"" comes from - you're buying an option to buy/sell at a fixed price in future.

For example I might think TSLA is going to rise in price in the next year, but I want to limit my losses to 20% of my current holding in case I'm wrong. I can buy a Put Option on TSLA at, say, 90% of the current price, and pay a fee of about 10% of the current price. Then in a year, I have an option to sell my TSLA shares at 90% of the current price. I'm down my fee and the 10% loss, but if the price has dropped to 50% in a year, I've massively reduced my risk. The downside being that if the price goes up 20% in a year, I'm only actually up 10% because I've paid a fee for my Option.",2531,True,1611893728.0,2021-01-29 05:15:28,142,0,audigex,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/l7fw2f/elon_burn_ouch/gl6ydp8/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,gl6ydp8

comment,l7qlfh,l7qlfh,,"Yeah... So I've found a pretty massive wrench in everyone's thesis.

The short interest results that were posted 1/27 were actually settled 1/15. There has been enough volatility in the past 2 weeks for shorts to easily close out without anyone noticing. If that's true, it would make sense for them (or anyone) to short again while above 300, especially if they knew the original 61 million shorts were already cleared.

People also keep saying ""Days to Cover is still 2.5!"" Yeah, that doesn't mean anything in a volatile market like this. Days to Cover, aka Short Interest, is a function of (Shares Shorted) / (Avg Volume). Avg volume is over the past 30 days. The first 15 of the past 30 days saw much lower volume. Current Short Ratio is closer to 0.5-1. If they could cover their entire positions in 1 day (causing a spike obviously), who's to say they didn't clear over a 10 day period (causing the spikes we saw), then, knowing they lost $4 billion (if cleared around the $62 price range, which I suspect), why not take out new short positions around $300? The price can't go up any more if there's no short squeeze coming.

Just my 2 cents. I get downvoted for this on WSB, so it's apparent no one wants to objectively discuss this very real possibility.

post,lcftzc,,10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.",9257,True,1612445969.0,2021-02-04 14:39:29,4134,498,pmchem,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lcftzc/10_interesting_and_useful_etfs_with_less_than_1b/,True,0.98,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,

Model 3 is no slouch when it comes to handling but it's not close to that level.

Plus the Taycan it's a lot faster and has a way more comparable range to the Model 3 than it looks on paper.

All of this is to say that, even the fact that you could compare the two is crazy, I'll agree with you.

The real comparisons that are ridiculously skewed to Model 3's favor are the ones that compare it to other luxury performance sedans at the same point, though.

post,lm2mry,,"BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, is starting to ""dabble"" in Bitcoin","https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/blackrock-has-started-to-dabble-in-bitcoin-says-rick-rieder.html

BlackRock’s Rick Rieder told CNBC on Wednesday the world’s largest asset manager has begun entering the bitcoin space.

The remarks from Rieder, who is BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, came on the same day bitcoin broke above $51,000 for the first time.

“Today the volatility of it is extraordinary, but listen, people are looking for storehouses of value,” Rieder said on “Squawk Box.” “People are looking for places that could appreciate under the assumption that inflation moves higher and that debts are building, so we’ve started to dabble a bit into it.”

In January, BlackRock added bitcoin futures as an potential investment for two of its funds, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The funds are BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities and BlackRock Global Allocation Fund.

A number of other financial institutions, such as BNY Mellon and Mastercard, have made entrances into the crypto space in recent days. BNY Mellon, the nation’s oldest bank, will launch a digital assets unit later this year, while Mastercard intends to support certain cryptocurrencies on its formal network.

Electric vehicle maker Tesla also announced last week it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin using cash on its balance sheet and intends to begin accepting the digital coin as payment for its products.

The price of bitcoin has risen more than 70% this year, adding to a major rally that began in the fall. “My sense is the technology has evolved and the regulation has evolved to the point where a number of people find it should be part of the portfolio, so that’s what’s driving the price up,” Rieder said.

Despite bitcoin’s growing respectability as an asset class, Rieder said Wednesday that how much exposure an investor should have “depends on what the rest of your portfolio looks like.",2314,True,1613590487.0,2021-02-17 20:34:47,3653,1453,PZinger6,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lm2mry/blackrock_the_worlds_largest_money_manager_is/,True,0.97,2021,tesla,top,False,True,0,

post,lqfhuz,,Technology stocks are crashing – what now,"A friend just messaged me saying that his portfolio lost 10% of its value recently and that this was complete doomsday. Judging by the futures, the NQ is down 6.8% from its highs (a 1.8% gap down this morning alone). I get that, it's frustrating.

It is also noteworthy that the sell-off hurts technology stocks in particular. But mind that they were also the largest beneficiary in recent months:

* Nasdaq 100 is 53% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* S&P 500 is 31% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* DJIA is 19% above its weekly 200 EMA.

Which one is going to be hurt first and foremost once a correction is underway? Of course it's going to be the most stretched industry sector. Information technology is 28% of the S&P 500, and 20% of the DJIA.

If you buy stocks, you've got to have conviction in them. You've got to know what you are buying. Am I going to dump all my holdings just because they're ""overvalued"". Of course not. I'm going to hang in there with stocks going down 30% and then come back up 80%. Even if that takes another 3 years. It's the nature of the market and it is great at weeding out the less convinced.

Volatility is the price you pay for your returns.

If you held Apple all these years, you are sitting on a fortune now. Same goes for Amazon and many other megabrands of today. Amazon went top to bottom 60% several times in its history. You've got to have conviction in what you're buying to hold onto such kind of volatility. I also go to the grocery store to pick my favorite marmalade brand. If there's a 30% discount I'll pile up. But you cannot ever pile up if you don't have conviction in your holdings in the first place.

So here's what I would do. Go through your portfolio name by name. Ask yourself why it's there in the first place. Start with ""I own XYZ because..."". Warren Buffett had also advised it in one of his interviews. If you can't tell that story, sell it off. It doesn't belong in your portfolio.",2027,True,1614076976.0,2021-02-23 11:42:56,4054,1583,trendarchitect,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lqfhuz/technology_stocks_are_crashing_what_now/,True,0.94,2021,elon,top,False,False,0,
comment,lqfhuz,lqfhuz,,"Bonds are always being sold just like stocks are. Stocks have the stock market, bonds have the bond market.

Yields are going up because inflation is going up. If you are buying debt, and inflation is rising faster than the interest rate, then you're essentially _paying_ the borrower for access to your money. So bond buyers are demanding higher interest rates right now, causing yields to increase as well.

Then your super safe index investor begins to look at historically high bond yields compared to SPY and it's risks, and decides to invest in bond indexes. This outflow causes SPY and it's components to go lower. Someone that was invested in TSLA will look at how low SPY is and it's relative security, and invest into that. This will lower the price of TSLA, making it attractive to the CCIV holder, etc. 

The whole thing is a feedback loop because this shift into bonds really does make stocks go down, _and_ at the same time feel more risky, causing people to but ""safe"" bonds.

post,lt7oop,,JPMorgan advises clients to expose 1% of their portfolio to Bitcoin,"In a recent note to clients, strategists from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) suggested a one percent portfolio allocation to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

As reported by Bloomberg, JPM strategists Joyce Chang and Amy Ho opined that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against fluctuations from traditional assets like bonds, stocks, and commodities. However, they advised clients to allocate a small percentage due to the risk of major downturns in Bitcoin’s value.

After setting a new all-time high above $58,000, the value of the digital asset slumped to less than $45,000 and has been struggling to recover ever since.

Chang and Ho told investors:

>*In a multi-asset portfolio, investors can likely add up to 1% of their allocation to cryptocurrencies in order to achieve any efficiency gain in the overall risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio.*

Bitcoin has welcomed major investments from the likes of Paul Tudor Jones, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and MicroStrategy. The endorsement from JPM comes at a time when institutional players are rushing to accumulate the digital asset. As per Bloomberg’s report, America’s oldest bank BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has also announced plans to enable Bitcoin transactions for its clients.

The strategists were quick to add that cryptocurrencies should be viewed as an investment vehicle and opposed to being funding currencies like the USD or EUR. This appears to be contrary to earlier statements from other JPM analysts that called cryptocurrencies the “poorest hedge for major drawdowns in equities.”

EDIT:
[Latest Update!](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/m8ac8v/130am_update_still_trapped_at_a_supercharger/grji3sv)

EDIT:

FINAL UPDATE - Apologies for taking so long to give an update here, I just wanted to wait to confirm whether this was an ongoing issue or not. Once Tesla got engaged, they were great about getting the car in quickly and doing all the diagnostic work they could think of. They had even seen my Reddit posts, so they were up to date on the situation without having to explain anything.

The weren’t able to replicate the issue, but wound up replacing the charge port anyway to be safe. The data from the car suggested a voltage spike during charging which caused the charge port to enter a fault  state and shut off. It’s unclear why the cord would not disengage, but I’m assuming it was able to do so once that fault cleared itself overnight. This makes some sense as it was pouring rain a few minutes prior to us charging, which I was told is the main culprit for this voltage spike fault.

Since then, we’ve had no issues with charging (knock on wood).",1585,True,1616133469.0,2021-03-19 06:57:49,1712,0,SeaEnergy,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/m8ac8v/130am_update_still_trapped_at_a_supercharger/grgbbix/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,grgbbix
comment,m8ac8v,m8ac8v,,"This will sound stupid but I didn’t see it happen in the video nor have I read all of the suggestions and in your other post I saw almost entirely only mentions of pulling on it as hard as you can so might I suggest pushing it back in? This is something I’ve seen happen before with even the mobile charger and wall connector as the latch can get stuck in the channel just like pins in a lock when attempting a lock pick (for lack of a better example). And again I am basing this purely off the video as it seems there is only outward force being applied to it so maybe you already do this and have done this for this case, BUT, I would suggest always lightly “jerking” the plug both in and out after and even a little before pressing the button. You can feel and hear the plug give a little as it slides in and out ever so slightly and hits the limits of the lock and the channel (which is another reason I am suggesting this is because I did not hear that in the video). This basically ensures that the channel is lined up and not pressed on the locking pin which is holding it in either by the angle it is pushing the locking pin or friction between the mechanism and the cable insert itself.

But best of luck to you nonetheless.

comment,m8ac8v,m8ac8v,,"Last Update for Now:

I got a call this morning around 11:30am from someone at Tesla Service. She had already seen this Reddit post, had read all of the updates, and had someone on their way to inspect the charging station.

I then dropped off the car this afternoon at the service center. Everyone there had seen this post as well and knew what was going on as soon as I arrived. They said they’re going to take a few days to run some tests, look at the error logs, and try to recreate the issue. Probably won’t have an update on that until early next week.

I should mention that I’m not upset with any individual for what happened. Every single Tesla employee I’ve spoken to has been professional and (I think) did everything they can to help resolve this. The larger concern I have is around the organization and staffing decisions. If the future is in electric cars, we need to know that they won’t leave us stranded somewhere for 15+ hours while we wait for support.

post,n6dh3d,,I sold every share I own today.,"I got into the market last year post Covid around May or June. Since then it has been an absolute rollercoaster trying to pick stocks. I was up 100% on multiple stocks including Tesla, Carvana, Square, Fiverr. I didn't sell because you're supposed to hold for the long term I heard, only for those stocks and others over many months to drop 30% - 80% or more. I bought some new stocks in February only for them to then drop 30% or more in a matter of months. I have spent months this year and last inside on beautiful days going cross eyed staring at charts trying to figure out what stock to buy, what to sell, why this stock is going up, why this stock is going down. As we speak I'm sitting inside on a beautiful day writing this. I have admitted to myself I don't understand stocks. I don't understand businesses. I have reached a point where I stopped caring about losing money. That's a dangerous road I'm sure. With the amount of stocks I've bought and sold, I don't know if I'm up or down.

Evidence I don't understand stocks is that today Twitter is worth less than it was in 2013 when it IPO'd. One of the most popular social media apps in the entire world I would have assumed would be worth something. Apparently not. It may seem I'm impatient or have a short term horizon for the market, but if I bought Twitter in 2013, I would have wasted 8 years of my life holding it.

PLTR backed by Peter Thiel and signing multi-million dollar contracts week after week, well the bottom just fell out. While it will probably go back up, I don't understand when and why it would. If a company with that much growth potential can't go up, what chance does anything else have.

10 months ago I bought DKNG at $25 and sold a few months later for about $50. Today it's worth a little more than was 10 months ago. I'm glad I got out when I did.

So, I am buying the S&P.

post,ncc7gx,,23% of Tesla's Q1 earnings were from Bitcoin trading - and they would have missed earnings otherwise,"Title says it all.

Tesla's earnings in the first quarter were $438 million.

$101 million (23%) of that came from selling Bitcoin for profit.

The other interesting part is that it would have been an earnings miss without the trading.

Did one make the other happen?

Considering the recent news about not allowing Bitcoin anymore, it's certainly a move worth mentioning.

comment,kv41b2,kv41b2,,"Tesla's atmospheric energy harvesting ideas appear to be disclosed in the 1921 patent of Hermann Plauson. It says a large Tesla coil (like Tesla built at Colorado Springs, 40-100 m diameter) can harness power from thunderstorms, but to receive significant power, the coil needs to be huge (1-100 km diameter). Gernsback's artwork for Plauson's work depicted a coil made of powerline. Plauson also used magnesium aluminum alloy balloons covered with tiny spikes electropolished and coated with amalgamated zinc doped with thorium or polonium. He elevated these balloons as high as 3 km. It's possible there could be a nuclear reaction between the aluminum, magnesium, zinc, mercury, thorium/polonium, plasma and powerful electric fields that increases efficiency that was not disclosed. Here's the 1921 American patent. https://patents.google.com/patent/US1540998

In a 1922 editorial Gernsback wrote Plauson got 720 W (400 V, 1.8 A) with a single balloon at 300 yards (270 m) and 3.4 kW (500 V, 6.8 A) using two balloons. He said one hundred balloons, 100 yards apart, will generate at least 200 horsepower (150 KW), up to 400 during winter (300 KW). Plauson published a book about atmospheric energy harvesting in German, *Gewinnung und Verwertung der Atmosphatischen Elecktrizitat* (1922).

comment,kv41b2,kv41b2,,">Apparently Tesla wanted to combine atmospheric energy harvesting with wireless power transmission. His World Wireless System was intended to be a system of towers around the world for global wireless power transmission using very low frequency (4-12 kHz) surface waves.

We already have this in the form of VLF radio which, when you start getting into how it actually works, explains why Tesla's power transmission ideas wouldn't have worked. Even if you have an ideal surface wave you're still looking at 1/r attenuation. You can try this yourself even - set up a receiver for the VLF trasmitter SAQ in Grimeton at a distance of a 10-20 km, see what kind of power you get out of it. Bear in mind the antenna system has about 100 kW going into it, of which around 11% is actually radiated.

There are plenty of ways of harvesting energy at VLF frequencies and down. The problem is doing so economically.

comment,kv41b2,kv41b2,,"Surface waves are not radio. Surface wave energy is conserved in the resonator. It is not radiated. Any radio waves produced are counted as a loss.

One form of Tesla's surface wave method was apparently disclosed in the 1918 patent of Charles Roe. It feeds dephased AC through two ground paths. https://patents.google.com/patent/US1333095

This wave transmission method may explain why Wardenclyffe had a huge and complex grounding system that Tesla said cost as much to construct as the tower itself.

edit: Daniel Watts Troy patented the single-path ground conductor version in 1903. https://patents.google.com/patent/US776876

The way these use resonance to eliminate resistance losses between the transmitter and receiver comes from Tesla's 1897 single-wire power transmission patent. https://patents.google.com/patent/US593138

comment,kv41b2,kv41b2,,">No, surface waves are not radio. Surface wave energy is conserved in the resonator. It is not radiated. Any radio waves produced are counted as a loss.

The words you're looking for are near-field and far-field. Even for 4 kHz the near field only extends to at most 150 km (2λ). Granted this is in free space. The surface wave near field could possibly extend a bit further, much like how you can have reactive components at the far end of a coaxial cable. But this isn't really what the patent is claiming in the end. More on that later.

There are people that experiment with VLF transmission, so-called LowFERs. Some use antenna systems quite similar to this patent. The key to getting them to work reasonably well is low ground conductance, but not so low that the resulting antenna impedance is impractically high. There's practical upper limit on impedance, around 2 kOhm if I remember correctly, where the necessary ratio between the wire separation and wire diameter become physically impossible to achieve. All this can be simulated with FEM software if you like. The amount of reactance you can have in L or C are likewise limited, for similar reasons. Stray capacitance limits how small C can be.

The way the patented system might actually work relies on differences in conductivity. Things must be arranged so that G1-G3 and G2-G4 have much higher conductivity than G1-G2 and G3-G4, and the patent gives examples like utilizing rivers and other geographical features.

His main fluidic invention was his bladeless turbine that he said he first conceived while working for Edison, which was 30 years before he patented it. It appears he had already sold or given that invention to others before he patented it himself.

Tesla used his turbine in an electrostatic generator to pump a gas or fluid charge carrier. Apparently Alfred W. Simon patented it in 1933. https://patents.google.com/patent/US2004352

Tesla's bladeless turbine also appeared as the propulsion mechanism of a flying machine patented in 1944, which appears to be Tesla's ""perfect flying machine"" that he said he would give to the League of Nations for peacekeeping purposes.

But you're mangling the details of his electromagnetic theory. Maxwell theorized the electromagnetic field (""ether"") must be incompressible, but Tesla disagreed. Tesla conceptualized the electromagnetic field as an ultrafine gas that only becomes more or less incompressible by electromagnetic forces acting upon it at the surface of conductors. He disagreed with the relativistic concept of considering space and time to be entities rather than metrics. He called the concept of space curvature illogical.

If anyone is interested I could post more about what Tesla called his ""dynamic theory of gravity"" and some contemporary work that appears to explain what he must have been talking about. I haven't posted it here before because it doesn't look particularly impressive. The contemporary work is all the work of one old engineer, and his papers are all self-published except for one peer-reviewed paper about the pattern of earth's stationary atmospheric electric field oscillations.

Instead of posting about it, here are links to it. It's interesting but weird. He built an ultraprecise electrometer and did a lot of simple experiments with it to reach very unconventional conclusions about gravity.

post,nrw7cv,,Biden bans US investment in Chinese military and tech surveillance sectors,"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/03/biden-bans-us-investment-chinese-military-tech-surveillance

Joe Biden has signed an executive order that bans American entities from investing in dozens of Chinese companies with alleged ties to defense or surveillance technology sectors.

In a move that his administration says will expand the scope of a legally flawed Trump-era order, the US treasury will enforce and update on a “rolling basis” the new ban list of about 59 companies.

It also bars buying or selling publicly traded securities in target companies, and replaces an earlier list from the defense department, senior administration officials told reporters.

The order prevents US investment from supporting the Chinese military-industrial complex, as well as military, intelligence, and security research and development programs, Biden said in the order.

“In addition, I find that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside [China] and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constitute unusual and extraordinary threats,” Biden said.

A White House fact sheet on the order said the policy would take effect for those companies listed on 2 August.

Major Chinese firms included on the previous defense department list were also placed on the updated list, including Aviation Industry Corp of China (AVIC), China Mobile Communications Group, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC).

SMIC is key to China’s national drive to boost its domestic chip sector.

post,pjh26x,,Is currently possible to use the Tesla Turbine in a practical way?,"Recently I heard about the Tesla Turbine, it intrigyed me so much so I started to search information about, so I'm not the most knowledgeable on the topic, but I found that even with the extremly high possible efficiencie of the turbine (over than 90%) this design is not prolificly used today.

The reasons for this that I found for this situation are the next:

* A Tesla turbine can rotate producing more than 35,000 rpm in practical aplications used for energy generators are needed very big disks, 2-4 meters diameter, in ideal operation the speed at the edges of the discs can exceed by several times that of the turbines currently used. As far as I know, no material in its time would be able to resist the deformation produced, in addition to being very difficult to control.
* Each turbine needs and specific arrangement for disks determined by the size of the bundary layer according to the fluid which will be used to power to the turbine. Any change on the separation between disks highly decrease the efficiency.

As I said I'm not the knowledgeable about these topics, but I was really interested to know if currently exist a material able to be used in a Tesla turbine, or how the problems could be solved. Neither I know if the original design is able to be used today with all its possible efficiency.

comment,pm19na,pm19na,,"This is a very short range wireless power system for electric trains. It might also be useful for electric vehicles today. Highways could charge your car without stopping or plugging anything in.

It was intended for powering multiple light railcars, which might mean 15-150 kW per vehicle with around a megawatt on a line. That would be enough to charge a lot of cars. It's also enough for power distribution, which means powered streets could replace overhead power lines in some places.

The line could reach higher voltage for the same insulation as an overhead line rather than underground, because air is more insulating than soil, but an overhead line carrying gigawatts of low frequency RF would probably expose people to excessive fields. It would be simpler with the line over the ground rather than in this underground conduit, but that would also expose people to stronger fields.

Tesla had a number of different wireless power ideas. This extremely short range induction power system was one of the first. He also had an idea to encircle a large area in a large 1-100 km diameter coil to supply the enclosed area with wireless power. Those two methods are two forms of induction.

comment,pjh26x,pjh26x,,"The short answer is ""No.""

But here's the more complicated answer: The statement ""possible efficiency"" is doing a lot of work when it comes to a Tesla turbine.

The rotor has been mathematically worked out to be capable of above 90% mechanical efficiency but thus far nobody has demonstrated the ability to solve the outlet losses on the design.

In reality there hasn't been any verifiable examples I've found of the unit much breaking 40% efficiency and this is not the kind of starting point where one wants to be when investing in making one with space-age materials.

Now be that as it may I think the Tesla turbine has some significant value. I think we should table the notion of the Tesla turbine as a super efficient machine and think of it as a mediocre one that has value due to its low cost/easy manufacture.

It belongs in places where robustness is key. I envision sufficiently large diameter Tesla turbines powering synchronous direct-drive generators running on air bearings powered by a run-of-river hydraulic air compressor (trompe).

While other turbine or pseudo-turbine designs would yield better overall outputs the benefit is that is the ability to make a cost-effective direct drive turbine that has no fuel costs, has no point of physical contact (air bearing) and doesn't need to be sharpened or filed down if left unattended.",3427,True,1631825083.0,2021-09-16 22:44:43,2,0,Cheebzsta,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/pjh26x/is_currently_possible_to_use_the_tesla_turbine_in/hd4j6n9/,True,,2021,both,new,False,False,0,hd4j6n9

post,qmjr7o,,"Tesla sells 1% of cars globally, yet is priced more than the companies combined that sell the other 99%","The valuation on Tesla is now beyond the absurd.  

Whilst European EV sales explode to presently 19% of all car sales this year, Tesla does not even make the top five EV sellers by company at a lowly 7%. (VW 25%; Stellantis 13%; Daimler 10%; BMW 10%; Hyundia-Kia 9%).

Tesla, unlike in the US, is simply being outsold by the vast array of alternative BEV models on sale particularly.  VW group alone offers the e-up, ID3 and ID4 (ID5 not yet on sale); Audi e-tron, e-tron Sportback e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT; Cupra Born; and Skoda Enyaq

In China Tesla has been pushed into 3rd place this year by BYD which has seen EV sales grow from 53K Q1; 98K.Q2; 183K Q3.  Tesla meanwhile has seen China quarterly sales for 2021 flattish at 69K, 62K and 75K.  China will likely sell 3 million EV's this year, half the worlds volume and Tesla sales are flat for the year.  Tesla might sell a lowly 9%.

Tesla dominates the US markets of course, where few EV models are on sale.  EV sales might be 3% of automotive sales.

Whilst investors will assert these stats do not.matter and Tesla's valuation is all about  tech, batteries and robo-taxis, it still does not sell any car related tech beyond its own cars.  Take up of FSD is a lowly 11%.  It still buys it's battery cells.  By its own statements it has a level 2/3 driver assist whilst companies like Waymo are already starting to offer level 4/5 robo-taxis in cities like San Fran (a free trial program has commenced).

With Tesla slipping badly in the two biggest and mature EV markets globally, it's EV mkt share has fallen from near 18% highs in 2019 to 14.7% YTD in 2021.  With Europe and China likely to see 20% EV sales, the Tesla domination of global car mkts story is looking utterly flawed, yet its market capitalisation is now than the entire companies combined that sell 99% of cars and are adding EV's faster.

comment,qspovy,qspovy,,"This book is this random guy's uniquely unusual theories of radio propagation presented as his own Summers' theory of wireless. What makes it interesting is that the theories are Tesla's, and they're explained here in more detail than I've ever seen anywhere else. You can tell it's Tesla's by comparing it to Tesla's statements. The word choices used throughout the text are notably identical to Tesla's. It includes an explanation of Tesla's one-wire power transmission system with details that indicate the author had personal insight into Tesla's work. It mentions Tesla a few times, calling him the Father of Wireless.

If, like me, you have been looking for some key to decipher Tesla's seemingly confusing statements about radio that he never explained adequately, this appears to be it. 

Tesla said he visited Hertz in 1891 to explain an important error, but he never said exactly what it was. This book explains Hertz's error in a specific experiment and its implications for electrodynamics. To summarize, it says radio transmission takes place by two simultaneous processes. The first is air conduction, which it credits David Edward Hughes for discovering in 1879. Summers misspells Hughes. Hughes never published anything about it, but his findings created a sensation among European scientists. The second process, ground conduction, it notes is confined near the surface, which accurately describes surface wave propagation.",4926,True,1636769221.0,2021-11-13 03:07:01,2,0,dalkon,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/qspovy/revolutionary_theories_in_wireless_1920_frank/hkeqx0s/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,hkeqx0s

post,r0m3yh,,I regret buying a Tesla and I haven't driven a single mile yet.,"This isn't a post about charging or the lack of physical buttons. 

This is a post about a complete lack of customer service. 

I preordered a Model 3 LR three months ago. I was given a delivery window of Mid November to mid December. I got a message last week saying it was my turn to pick up my car. Sweet. They give me a choice of three days on their website to pick up the car. November 24, 25, 26. I find it a bit odd that thanksgiving they are open but I'm working on the 24th and the 26th and on such short notice I can't get out of work. So I put down delivery for the 25th. After all other stores are open on thanksgiving and the site blacked out other dates. 

I get messages from Tesla that I need to get my car insurance and pay the down payment or I won't be able to get the car. No problem. 

I pay the down payment via their app and get the insurance. I upload the proof to their app. All good. 

Then yesterday on 11/22/2021 I get a phone call at 3 pm saying that I can no longer pick up the car on 11/25 because they aren't actually open. 

Uh ok. So you tell me this after I put down the down payment and pay for the insurance. I'm a little pissed at this point but I get it. Let me pick it up another day then. And why didn't you tell me sooner?

They would only let me pick the 24th or 26th. That's it. I asked them can I pick up the car on December 2nd because I have work and can't reschedule or get someone to cover me on such short notice. Their response is ""no, we can't hold the car that long. We will give your car to someone else and you can wait another 3-4 weeks for another car to come in.""

The heck? They made the mistake. Took my money. Made me buy insurance for a car that I don't actually have and then they try to bully me into a specific delivery date on short notice? That's not fair. 

To make matters worse I try to post my story to r/teslamotors and it gets automatically deleted.

They are a popular type of pump today in specific applications, but as far as I've seen, the companies that make them never acknowledge Tesla in any way. 

Tesla wanted to use them for a type of fan jet engine for his flying machines, which he described in minimal detail in his flying machine patents. Tesla's flying machine concept was advanced further after his death by someone who looks like he probably got info from Tesla. I could post about that some time if anyone is interested. 

A Tesla turbine can also be used as a turbomolecular vacuum pump. Tesla patented that idea in 1921 only in the UK. [GB179043](https://patents.google.com/patent/GB179043)

Tesla said his cryogenic resonant transformer allowed him to attain much more powerful currents than he could before. He patented his cryogenic resonator a decade before Heike Kamerlingh Onnes discovered superconductivity in 1911.

Looking at his electronic inventions Plauson obviously worked with Tesla. Besides Tesla's idea of atmospheric energy harvesting, Plauson also patented the resonant induction motor, the underlying principle of which Tesla had first demonstrated in 1892. Tesla demonstrated the principle but never explained how to make practical use of it, and neither did anyone else until Plauson patented it in 1919. Plauson also included the idea for citywide wireless power in his patent. The coil around a city for energy harvesting would also provide wireless power transmission with very high transmission efficiency. Induction is normally only thought of as a very short range transmission method, but everywhere within a huge coil, the transmission distance is zero, so induction is very efficient. There's a lot more they have in common too if you look.

comment,qspovy,qspovy,,"**26—Work of Hertz.** It was about the year 1888 when a German physicist, Heinrich Hertz, made some experiments that were of untold value to science by confirming in an experimental way the theories of Maxwell, that wireless waves and light were similar. While he thought these wireless waves, when detected at a distance from an induction coil was by electromagnetic induction alone. Science quickly accepted this theory and here was the beginning of the system of electro-static oscillations as used today for the transmission and reception of intelligence around the world. Prof. Hertz used a coil of wire, and when placed in a conductor of strong invisible electric currents, enough electricity was conducted to the coil to produce a visible spark when the two ends of the coil were close together. When this coil was close to the spark gap of the induction coil electro-static and magnetic induction was no doubt the cause of part of the current in the Hertz coil. But the air acting as a conductor for the invisible electric waves was by far the greater and dominating cause. But this electro-static and magnetic field only exist a very short distance from the induction coil of wireless transmitting station and the electro-static currents travelling by conduction through the air are the sole cause of our wireless detectors responding to same. The electro-static and magnetic field quickly dies out.

comment,r93ixi,r93ixi,,"I've never heard that. I'm curious where you did. It is an interesting idea. 

A Chicago inventor, Albert G Whitney proposed building a railway around the equator with the trains pulled by tethered satellites. That was probably Tesla's idea or influenced by him. Of course that's probably not practical, but it's still an interesting idea. A coil around the equator could be used to receive current. 

The atmosphere already does absorb electromagnetic energy from space. The process could be manipulated for energy harvesting or to modify the atmosphere. The magnetosphere is made out of huge plasma tubes spanning north to south that rotate by the energy they receive from space. 

The most immediate use for modifying the atmosphere would be to address global warming. The heat of the atmosphere is a function of the pressure of positive ions, which means efficient means to neutralize positive charge could be used to cool the atmosphere. For example, fountains could be used as neutralizer-ionizers to allay urban heat islands. 

Electrostatic atmospheric manipulation is probably complicated by the solar wind. Plasma conductors thru the troposphere would heat the atmosphere by drawing positive ions in. It might be necessary to confine positive charge outside the troposphere to control the charge within it without interfering with the field above.

post,rxqpdy,,How long can a Tesla survive stranded on a freeway in the winter? I did the math to find out.,"After reading the Washington Post article about electric cars being unsuitable when stranded on a freeway in the winter, I decided to do an experiment to find out the truth.

**The Scenario**

* My Model X was fully preconditioned prior to the start of the test
* The battery was charged to 80% prior to the start of the test
* Temperatures here in Michigan today were very uniform.  20 degrees all day.
* After preconditioning, the Model X was parked in my driveway for the test period
* Seat heaters, and steering wheel heaters were activated.  
* Cabin temp set to 70 degrees.  HVAC on Auto mode.
* Camp Mode was started, and the car was left in the driveway for the test period
* Vehicle doors will remain closed during the test period.  Mobile App used to acquire data every hour.
* Test duration:  5 hours

**The Raw Data**

* 79% - 207 miles - 11:45am - **Test Start**
* 76% - 201 miles - 12:53pm
* 74% - 196 miles  - 1:46pm
* 69% - 181 miles - 3:48pm
* 67% - 175 miles - 4:45pm - **Test End**

**The Results**

* Model X used an average of 2.4% of battery per hour throughout the test period
* Range went from 207 miles, to 175 miles at the end of the test.
* 5 hours of Camp mode utilized…
   * 32 miles of range
   * 12 % of range
* 24 hours of Camp Mode would require (extrapolated)…
   * 153 miles of range
   * 58% of range

This data conclusively proves that a Model X can easily keep all passengers in complete comfort during a 24 hour duration event while stranded on the freeway in the winter, using less than half of the maximum battery capacity.  All the while, the passengers have access to Netflix, video games, and plenty of online entertainment.

&#x200B;

Next step - I might re-run this same test tomorrow with my Model S.

**EDIT:**  It's going to be a bit colder on Friday, but I'm thinking about running the test again on the Model X with a 50 degree interior temperature, and running the original test (70 degree interior) on my Model S.",2034,True,1641507810.0,2022-01-06 23:23:30,1181,343,TheGadgetGuy1,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/rxqpdy/how_long_can_a_tesla_survive_stranded_on_a/,True,0.97,2022,tesla,top,False,False,0,

comment,sf20o4,sf20o4,,"I've seen this interview before. It's remarkably dull for how interesting what they're talking about should be. 

Stan Deyo, the interviewer who made that documentary, applied for a patent for an energy harvesting device in 2007. He said it's a version of Tesla's system. It appears to be Tesla's radiant energy concept. It uses high voltage on an aerial unipolar capacitance with a simple resonant circuit to harness electrostatic wave energy particularly 4.5-7 MHz, which is produced by random pressure waves propagated in the troposphere by the impacts of the solar wind and cosmic particles with the ionosphere. He cites Trump's research to describe how it works in the patent, which makes it seem like he got the idea from him.  https://patents.google.com/patent/US20080191580A1

edit: I found Stan Deyo has a YouTube channel where he has this documentary including this interview in better quality. https://youtu.be/KLJMQn4cZPs?t=1524

His first video he uploaded there says what he learned from Dr. Trump during this interview, which is the idea he applied to patent. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwxNTGpM1cQ

I'd seen his patent before, but I didn't think there was much to it because it's brief and more importantly I thought the frequency of the ambient energy must be lower. If there is much energy in the HF band (43-67 m), I reasoned someone would have noticed because radios operate in that range. Looking at it again now has made me reconsider.

comment,uvmhig,uvmhig,,"This is the best biography of Tesla's youth I've ever read. It provides considerable detail about events in Tesla's early life that he mentioned in his autobiography. It reads like an addendum to Tesla's autobiography that fills in the details. 

For instance it explains why as a child he became determined to become a genius before he knew what the word meant and pushed himself so forcefully to that goal. It says what he was doing when he got trapped in the abandoned church and how he was rescued. It says Tesla was so mad at Edison for lying about the promised bonus of $50,000 that he didn't tell anyone he quit. He just walked out without saying anything to anyone and never came back.

Unfortunately the author seems to lose track of everything Tesla did after around 1894-1900. It's clearly wrong about many things after the period it covers well. For instance it says Tesla and JP Morgan were good friends throughout their lives and that Morgan gave Tesla the money for Wardenclyffe without any conditions, but we know that's not true. Tesla sold Morgan the controlling stake in his wireless tech for the $150k he got for Wardenclyffe, which was only half the cost of constructing it. And then Morgan refused to sell it back to Tesla when Tesla subsequently wanted to work with other investors who actually wanted to see it work. Morgan wanted Wardenclyffe to fail and made that happen.",2000,True,1653261816.0,2022-05-23 01:23:36,3,0,dalkon,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/uvmhig/nikola_tesla_electrical_genius_arthur_j_beckhard/i9mdfpq/,True,,2022,tesla,hot,False,False,0,i9mdfpq
comment,uvmhig,uvmhig,,"Hey Dalkon! I love the research man! You always seem to have the best background sources. 

I do have to say though, not to contradict you, but the part about Tesla and JP Morgan is true. Tesla held no I’ll will towards him and the story is all part of the BS fantasy that has been built around Tesla. Check out what Tesla said in his own words about JP Morgan and even the government.

From “MY INVENTIONS V - THE MAGNIFYING TRANSMITTER”

“The tower was destroyed two years ago but my projects are being developed and another one, improved in some features, will be constructed. On this occasion I would contradict the widely circulated report that the structure was demolished by the Government which owing to war conditions, might have created prejudice in the minds of those who may not know that the papers, which thirty years ago conferred upon me the honor of American citizenship, are always kept in a safe, while my orders, diplomas, degrees, gold medals and other distinctions are packed away in old trunks. If this report had a foundation I would have been refunded a large sum of money which I expended in the construction of the tower. On the contrary it was in the interest of the Government to preserve it, particularly as it would have made possible — to mention just one valuable result — the location of a submarine in any part of the world.",3136,True,1653300550.0,2022-05-23 12:09:10,2,0,TesTurEnergy,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/uvmhig/nikola_tesla_electrical_genius_arthur_j_beckhard/i9o0igh/,True,,2022,tesla,hot,False,False,0,i9o0igh
comment,uvmhig,uvmhig,,"Thank you for the kind words and also pointing that out. 

That doesn't mean it's true either. That only means Tesla said it was true too. Tesla was apparently always much nicer to Morgan than he ever had any known reason to be. All that means is Tesla never wanted the public appearance of not getting along with Morgan. 

I don't believe the nice things Tesla said about Morgan are true, but that is another way that this book agrees with everything Tesla said to such an extent it seems like it could have been written by Tesla. It's possible Tesla wrote this book or most of it. Maybe he intended for it to be published for his centennial in 1956, but Beckhard didn't manage to get through editing and publishing in time for that. 

Despite the nice things Tesla said about Morgan publicly, the truth was finally revealed when the Tesla Museum released his telegrams. That's how we know Tesla was lying by saying his relationship with Morgan was always good. We can only speculate why—most likely out of misplaced hope Morgan would return the kindness. 

It's also worth noting Morgan was the money behind Edison and Marconi and everyone else who ever wronged Tesla and Westinghouse. And most importantly, Morgan intentionally stymied Wardenclyffe and Tesla's wireless power plans and stole the invention of radio from him for Marconi. Morgan gave Tesla every reason to hate him.

I mean, not really. Delaware Chancery Court is going to force him to go through with the sale at the $54.20 price specifically for all of the reasons you just said. Elon has *every financial incentive* not to do what he's doing, but he's got an addictive personality and, right now, he's addicted to shitposting.

He's going to instantly lose billions of dollars by spending $44B on a company that's worth, at most, about $20–30B. Not only that, but as his debt financing expires, he may be compelled to sell huge quantities of TSLA shares at a significant discount just to complete the purchase. 

On top of the billions he's going to lose in the sale, the SEC is also likely to fine him a giant amount of money or ban him from serving as an officer of any publicly traded company.

Elon's sitting comfortably in the ""fuck around"" phase right now, but the ""find out"" phase is coming. He can save face by following through on the $54.20 deal without forcing it through court.

comment,vn01fj,vn01fj,,"This patent describes simple apparatus that consists of a Tesla lightning protector positioned over a spark gap that is used to collect atmospheric energy. A Tesla lightning protector is an ultra high voltage terminal. The spark discharge is used as an antenna to collect both atmospheric charge and ambient thermal energy. The author says the electric thermal energy of the atmosphere is much greater than the energy of atmospheric electric charge. 

Among other inventors Hermann Plauson and Ewald Rasch patented similar concepts in 1920. Rasch used an arc discharge from a kite: [GB179967](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/010335657/publication/GB179967A?q=pn%3DGB179967A). Plauson used radioactive metal balloons flying over spark gaps hanging beneath the balloons and also at ground level: [US1540998](https://www.google.com/patent/US1540998). Apparently they also explained this same electric thermal energy concept, but their explanations were not as clear. Serafino Orlando explained the thermal energy more clearly in 1924: [GB231247](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/009699504/publication/GB231247A?q=pn%3DGB231247A).

comment,ws330d,ws330d,,"Al Hubbard was not known to be a protege of Tesla, but he must have been because he invented something Tesla had invented, a nuclear reactor so simple that it doesn't appear to be a nuclear reactor. It was a more advanced form of the same reactor first patented in 1896 by Tesla protege Nathan Stubblefield. 

This type of reactor is so simple that it's not much more than an electromagnet or array of electromagnets. It is a type of breeder reactor that requires only a tiny amount of highly radioactive material. Most of the material it uses is unenriched thorium and uranium crude ore. The small amount of enriched material may be as little as 50-100 mg of radium, enriched uranium, polonium, radon or pretty much any alpha emitter. Radon has the advantage of being an abundant byproduct of nuclear energy production and nuclear waste storage. As a gas it is unwieldy, but it could be used in a permanently sealed ampoule. 

Apparently Stubblefield's patent prevented Hubbard from obtaining a patent for his version of it. The Pittsburgh-based Radium Corporation of America bought the rights to Hubbard's invention and shelved it. That was the fate of all of Tesla's most powerful inventions. 

Tesla mentioned he discovered atomic radiation before anyone else a number of times, but he never tried to take credit for the true extent of his contributions. Tesla was the unsung true father of nuclear physics.

comment,x94ecz,x94ecz,,"Hello, Dr. Seifer. I hope you have a good response to your AMA.

I think Tesla occupies a unique position in the mind of America. I have not yet read your book, but as an example, let me site Spider Robinson, the Canadian author of the Callahan Cross-Time Saloon novels. In Callahan's Key, Tesla plays a pivotal role and he's a fantastical character with mastery over electrical knowledge that mere mortals cannot fathom.

My question: how do you think your book will address the popular idea that Tesla was, for lack of a better term, a wizard - considering that you actually named one of your books about him ""Wizard at War""?",627,False,1662657110.0,2022-09-08 19:11:50,8,0,[deleted],Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/x94ecz/im_marc_j_seifer_noted_biographer_of_tesla_who/inm29jt/,True,,2022,tesla,hot,False,False,0,inm29jt

When Hollywood called me to star in the 5-part limited series THE TESLA FILES, I went back to my records and found new recently de-classified documents from the FBI, CIA, OSS and also from, unbelievably, the Soviet Union! and so I honed in on what happened to Teslas secret weaponry papers. And I found to my astonishment that Tesla was actually negotiating with Joseph Stalin himself! and that FDR himself when he was president was trying to meet with Tesla at the height of WWII, so we now had to come up with a title for the new book and because he was the ""w"" word, we wanted to keep it in the title and that's how I came up with TESLA: WIZARD AT WAR.",844,False,1662657955.0,2022-09-08 19:25:55,11,0,Marc-Seifer,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/x94ecz/im_marc_j_seifer_noted_biographer_of_tesla_who/inm4ibe/,True,,2022,tesla,hot,False,False,0,inm4ibe
comment,x94ecz,x94ecz,,"Tesla was a Serb and to understand the Serbian people we need to know and appreciate what is known as the Battle of Kosovo which took place in 1389 (over 600 years ago!).  The Ottoman Empire were a brutal bellicose group who would slay the men, put their heads on stakes, rape the women and convert the children to their way of life. The Ottoman Empire was about to invade the whole of Europe, but to get there, they had to go through Serbia, and as Tesla states, ""Europe can never repay the great debt it owes the Serbians for checking, by the sacrifice of its own liberty, that barbarian influx."" 30,000 Turks died but the Serbs had comparable losses and their great kingdom which had a benevolent king, was destroyed in the process. According to Professor Markovitch who attended one of my lectures, ""It follows us always."" So every Serb knows that their utopian past was shattered on that day. Thus, Tesla set out to try and figure out a way to end all wars. However, for him to do this, he thought if he could come up with a truly horrible weapon, then no nation would be stupid enough to go to war, so he invented drone warfare through a remote controlled torpedo in 1898 during the Spanish American War and then the particle beam weapon, which was also called the death ray in the run-up to World War II. Tesla also billed this weapon as a ""peace ray,"" for that reason. If every nation had a perfect means of defense, war would end.

post,y4xdxo,,"I am kind of ashamed of owning a Tesla, which makes me sad.","First, just the sheer fact that I do not want to post this in a Tesla sub as to avoid backlash is representative of how I feel. Criticism is typically shunned by the Tesla fanboys, even if it is justified and unbiased. 

Second, I went with a Tesla because the technology was way above (IMO) the rest. Very much best in class, even though I feel like the outer design is a little too “different” for my taste. I’ve really enjoyed driving it. But the gap is quickly closing, and some of the design decisions and manufacturing makes me scratch my head.

The “ashamed” part, however, stems from the leader of the organization. He has become so polarizing that I can’t even have a conversation with people I meet regarding my Tesla without his name coming up. It makes me feel like people are looking at me as if I share his views because I own one. I wish he would just fade into obscurity with his billions and call it a win. I cannot wait for something to pop up (maybe the Rivian R1S) that grabs my interest the way Tesla initially did.

comment,z1qfgx,z1qfgx,,"The War of Electric Currents, a historical power struggle between two brilliant inventors - Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla - has shaped the world as we know it today. Supported by George Westinghouse, Tesla championed alternating current (AC) against Edison's direct current (DC), a battle that decided the future of electricity transmission.  
  
Edison, an ardent proponent of DC, held initial sway due to his established reputation. However, Tesla's AC system, more efficient and economical for long-distance transmission, had an inherent advantage. When Westinghouse, a shrewd industrialist, threw his resources behind Tesla's AC system, the tide began to turn.  
  
Westinghouse's win symbolizes a timeless lesson - superior technology often prevails, but not without the right support and resources. Today's electric grid, largely based on AC, stands as a testament to Tesla's foresight and Westinghouse's determination in the face of fierce opposition.",963,False,1687145454.0,2023-06-19 05:30:54,2,0,Maleficent_Soup4017,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/z1qfgx/ac_or_dc_how_nikola_tesla_enabled_george/jonw4hu/,True,,2023,tesla,hot,False,False,0,jonw4hu

post,151kpky,,I’ll never doubt Tesla’s navigation again,Driving from San Diego to Phoenix. The navigation routed me off the interstate and through the mountains saying I’d arrive at the next charger with 10%. Once I hit the point of no return I started realizing that there was no way I could possibly make it with enough battery to the charger. I was down to 3% with nearly 30 miles to go but it was still saying I was going to make it with 10%. Panic set in. AC and music off. Windows down. Wife getting our AAA info ready to have to call a tow truck. We were in the middle of nowhere with nowhere to even pull over off the road. Just as I was about to give up a road sign said “watch for braking downhill next 20 miles” next thing I know regenerative braking had my percentage slowly climbing. I climbed 8% during the downhill portion of the drive and made it with 10% just as it said I would. Tesla is a truly incredible machine.

20 miles south of Blanding there's a restaurant with some Level 2 chargers but that is it until Gallup.

The headwinds were fierce that day. ABRP Pro was picking up on that. The Tesla NAV not so much apparently. 

By the time I got to the restaurants, the arrival charge had dropped from 30 to 20%.

I added 5% more at the restaurant and arrived in Gallup with 10% just about where ABRP predicted and 20% less than the NAV predicted.

Tesla NAV has gotten better over time but it still routinely lowers it's estimated arrival SOC by 10% while you are in the middle of a drive.

www.TesTurEnergy.com 

Crafted with precision, the prototype boasts a robust design featuring an aluminum disc stack enclosed in a high-quality polycarbonate casing.      

The turbine is tailored to accommodate a variety of testing conditions, though currently optimized for compressed air tests.      

From initial trials, the turbine has shown promising potential, generating 1200 watts of power on a Dyno test with 30-40psi and a notable 250 watts electrical load when partnered with an upgrade generator package) on just 15psi of compressed air.  

It is also designed for future upgradeability, with provisions to accommodate a 2-stage upgrade we aim to release soon.      

While this turbine is a working prototype, it’s not a complete, turnkey solution or operational turbine. 

So, what’s the purpose of this unit?      

We’ve designed and are selling this prototype to provide a hands-on, engaging, and informative tool for those interested in our renewable energy systems, and specifically in Tesla turbine technology.

post,1b5o2uy,,Tesla hate is real,"After driving ICE cars that belonged to my parents or relying on public transport for the past years I decided after finishing my studies and getting a job I decided to buy my first own car. After taking into account costs + fun drive + luxury I decided an electric car would be the right option. Settled for a Tesla Model Y and am super happy. 
I obviously told my friends and family and damn  never expected such a negative reaction. 

I know there was a negative stigma around them but  literally from work, friends and family everybody was just criticizing my decision.
Instead of being happy for me or at least only mildly cricising due not having an electric car before I got comments like what a bad decision, never would buy electric, car will be worth 0 in 3 years, laughing about it being stupid, never able to take a long trip, charging on roadrips for hours with no range, etc. 

I couldn’t even argue with them and present my facts everybody just straight up was condescending and didn’t change their opinion. Yesterday another friend found out and said: „A Tesla/electric car driver will not be allowed to step into my car“ lol

Did you experience similar hate too? Really interesting that from my whole environment young or old has still such a big hate for Teslas or electric cars which I just dont understand like you dont have to like them but why hate so much when it doesn’t affect you…

The Caliber study relates specifically to corporate reputation, where Tesla dropped by almost 30 pts in its “Trust & Like” and “Consideration” indexes over the last two years, which measure peoples’ opinion of a brand and if they’d consider buying their product.

They don’t appear to draw a direct line to Musk’s behavior, unclear if there’s a question in their survey directly about that, but it would be a pretty strange thing to have asked *before* Musk started having a higher profile and revealed his controversial political alignment. I also seriously doubt they’d have questions about any other auto executives — could you even name the president of Honda America?

Instead Caliber threads the needle by pointing out their survey does show that 83% of adults know who Musk is and that he runs Tesla.

Not an entirely unreasonable conclusion to jump to, but I’d still rate this a bad use of data.

Personally I would not consider a Tesla because I think they’re generally very good computers wrapped in a very mediocre car.

post,1cltv4n,,I just had a car drive me 45 minutes to meet a client.,"This sub seems to just be overwhelmingly negative, so I thought I would add my real world experience with FSD in my 2024 M3. 

I just had a meeting with a client so I had to drive 45 minutes each way to meetup with them.  From my office I sent the address to the Tesla, so when I went out to the car the navigation was up on the screen read to go. I just confirmed the address and enabled FSD and then the car drove me the entire route with zero intervention. The route included all sorts of roads/highways/etc and it handled it flawlessly. 

If you really take a minute to think about what is happening it’s mind blowing that this is possible. 

FSD isn’t perfect, although I never had to intervene I still kept my hands on the wheel and foot near the gas/brake, just incase.

It shocks me how negative the tone is here about FSD. I live in Los Angeles where city driving can be hectic and the latest FSD v12 is a game changer.

It makes the right decisions (and drives better than I do) 99% of the time. The 1% of the time it makes the wrong decisions are usually very obvious beforehand and it's easy for me to disengage, quickly make the right decision, and fire FSD right back up.

I use it almost exclusively for every drive now and will never drive another car that doesn't offer it. Even despite monitoring the road the entire time, I am no longer making thousands of brain-fatiguing micro decisions every time I'm in the driver's seat and driving is such a pleasure.

comment,1d9r0xw,1d9r0xw,,"It’s critical to have your chief officer at a public company be reliable, stable, and a clear communicator. Elon is none of these things. He’s a liability to the brand at this point because he can’t keep his focus on Tesla consistently. 

He needs to accept that it’s okay to be a startup tycoon and not a lifelong CEO of everything he starts. It’s simply not possible to do well when you spread yourself so thin while running your mouth with incredibly unpopular opinions. Then the guy acts shocked that people don’t like him, and consequently, his brands. He makes emotional decisions that are just stupid, frankly. He then wakes up with a hangover of regret and his supposed delegates have to constantly cover his ass.

The basis of that termination is based on an nda violation. That violation being that I shared the photo that went viral on X confirming YouTube music a few hours before corporate released their video in X.  That said, I hold myself accountable for this and respect their choice.  This also will mark the end of my 20 years in automotive service industry.  

You’re a fantastic community and I will truly miss serving you.  It’s been a blessing these past couple years.  I’ve met some of the most incredible people by working here.

I don’t expect a reply but I know you will see this. Jeff will likely see it first and it’ll make its way to one of you.  It sucks and it hurts. I do love this company but I messed up and I get it.  I enjoyed the ride and would gladly do it again.

Some ideas based on customer feedback 

DMV Test Mode- DMVs around the country are failing young drivers primary due to our exceptional one pedal driving. You could piggy back the brake burnish command with a different UI.  This would force the driver to use the pedal and then the instructors would have less to grip about. 

Drivers Ed Mode- create a program that teaches young drivers the rules of the road through a series of challenges.  In this mode the vehicle will set up routes based on the users progress through the training these routes would become more advanced. Make it into a “simulator” of sorts and they could even practice the basics while parked.  

So folks, let’s have it.  I’m still held to some NDAs but my experiences are mine.  I’ll still gladly help you when and where I can.

post,1eimxw9,,"I tracked the price of 3000 used Teslas, here is what I found","I tracked the price of used cars listed on the Tesla website for the last 4 months. In total, I tracked \~3000 cars. I focused on cars listed in the San Francisco Bay Area. I used a linear regression model to determine what factors influence the price.

**Some insights:**

* Model Y and Model 3 cars are listed for 5 days on average before being removed/sold. Model X and S take a little longer, with an average of 7 days.
* Tesla automatically lowers the price if a car does not sell. On average the price decreased by $200 per day.
* 68% of all cars have basic Autopilot, 29% have FSD, 3% come with Enhanced Autopilot.
* 99% of eligible used cars include the Acceleration Boost option.

***Pricing factor estimates by model:***

**Model 3**

*Price reducing factors*

* $97 per 1000 miles driven
* $127 for each extra month in age
* $860 when previously repaired

*Model variants:*

* $3500 for Long range ($9000 new)
* $2300 performance version (new $7000)

*Premium options:*

* $1400 for EAP
* $2600 for FSD (new $8000)
* $90 for the white interior (new $1000)

Black ($221) and gray ($150) have a better resale value, compared to red (-$142), white (-$93) and blue (-$56).

No difference was found between 18 and 19 inch wheels ($1000 new)

**Model Y**

*Price reducing factors*

* $133 per 1000 miles driven
* $239 for each extra month in age
* $1600 when previously repaired

*Model variants:*

* $5500 for AWD ($3000 new)
* $3100 performance version (new $7000)

*Premium options:*

* $1900 for EAP
* $2800 for FSD (new $8000)
* $120 for the white interior (new $1000)

post,1frg26x,,Rented a Model 3. I get why rental companies are dumping Teslas.,"Preface: I own a Model Y and I love it. Best car I've ever owned.

Had to go to Albuquerque for a short 2-day business trip. Rented a compact car from Budget. Guy asked how far I'd be driving, I said almost none, staying in airport area. He asked if he can give me a Tesla, I said sure. He told me it was a Y, but it was actually a RWD 3 with the LFP pack.

After getting in the car, ALL the settings were jacked up. Screen on Light rather than auto, headlights on rather than auto, climate manual not auto. Random safety features turned off. Autopilot set to TACC-only (although I get that). Sentry on. Bunch of other ones I forget, but I had to fix almost every setting. Luckily battery was at 98% so thats good. Unlike Hertz, Budget does not allow app connectivity, just the card.

I drove away and attended a meeting for a few hours. Came back out to the A/C humming away, I had missed the cabin overheat protection setting, it drained 10% of the battery in the hot New Mexico sun. Luckily I only used 20% of the battery my whole trip because I stayed pretty local. Car was also sort of janky: really bad wind noise/gap in driver window somewhere, and suspension felt a little rattle-y compared to my Y. Car had 21k miles. However I was impressed with the power of the RWD model. It's totally adequate, if not impressive.

Anyway, the ONLY reason I was able to navigate all this is because I own a Tesla and I know all this stuff. I cannot imagine any non-Telsa-owner being able to figure all this out and being happy with the experience. And I didn't even have to figure out how/where to charge it, that would be a whole other ball of wax for a new person. Beyond depreciation, I bet they've gotten tons of user complaints on these.

No problems. Had a couple of recall fixes, and one of the fixes they messed up the trunk seal which then leaked and needed to be repaired.

comment,1g7hhm8,1g7hhm8,,"I think it’s really easy for nuance and details to get lost over text, which is part of why I don’t like everything being handled through the app. There’s a convenience factor for sure, but being there in person with a service advisor (ideally the same one each time) who can physically see the issue and keep track of things is a much better approach for situations like OP’s. 

Tesla’s advisors, from what I can tell, work from a queue and it’s often not the same person you’re interacting with from message to message or day to day (mainly in the app). I also imagine they have time-to-response metrics they’re held to in some way, so it’s super easy for context to get lost when you’re unfamiliar with the situation and jump into the message thread without reading all of the past service history and notes. 

It’s pretty inexcusable for a company of Tesla’s size to handle things this way, especially when dealing with more complex situations. It’s one thing to handle a simple tire rotation like this, but when dealing with a (fairly) complex warranty issue, there are just too opportunities for details to get lost over text. 

I’d agree that showing up in person is the way to go. I’ve always had good experiences with Tesla’s service advisors in person; so if OP has one near by, showing up in person and calmly explaining the situation would be the best place to start.

post,1gxe3oj,,Bedini SG energizer (!motor),"
Aaron murakami wrote a 3-book series on Bedini’s SG energizer. He states the machine’s output is sub 100% efficiency. The magic (which does happen) is IN the battery itself.

In essence, the goal of the motor/generator/energizer/<pick your confusing ambiguity here> is to impulse the battery. The mechanical part just adds noise to the understanding IMO. I made a PBC that generates plain impulses, originally it was a high-side bridge (for negative flyback spikes), but I adapted it for Bedini’s positive impulses.

Currently testing and can’t confirm yet the charging battery charges faster than the primary discharges. But I do see the “h” curve and a the right signals (I’d add a pic but this Reddit is limited)

The theory is that sharp impulses/energy gradients (which are aren’t that sharp once directed to the battery as it behaves as a capacitor widening the signal.) polarize (if that’s the right terminology for surrounding big ions with negative charge) the ions in the battery and they then autonomously migrate to the positive plates (i.e. not being actively pushed by current).

My PCB can run a couple Modes (high voltage impulses, capacitors discharges)
1st pic: high voltage impulses, shorted to the battery above zener BVR, (12V and 24V above secondary battery level). This causes the famous “h curve”

2nd pic: capacitor discharge mode. The h grows taller and thinner until it’s discharged violently on the battery.

3rd: pic schematic impulse PCB abstracted as a MOSFET. 

4th pic: Bedini inspired PCB, Master Ivo inspired impulse PCB, tesla coil, 12V secondary battery. 

I run both batteries with common ground and the primary biased up 6-12V, so the current that normally would be wasted to ground for charging the coil, ends up going to the secondary right before the impulse is caused.

Currently (1st and last pics) pushing secondary to avg 12.83V ; the primary steady at 18.71V ~120mA (started test +1hr ago and it marked 18.",2153,True,1732298635.0,2024-11-22 19:03:55,19,7,juanmf1,Tesla,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gxe3oj,False,0.9,2024,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

The H-1B visa gives an employer complete control over the employee. If the employee loses the job, they lose their visa and are sent back to their home country. This is why the plutocrats want the H-1B visas. In the program employees can be coerced into working 100-hour weeks for below average pay.

Tellingly, Elon Musk runs Tesla as a nonunion shop in the United States. Musk also has ongoing well-publicized disputes with the unions in Germany and Sweden. Musk's just a less interesting version of the 19th century robber barons who hired Pinkertons to fire upon the rank-and-file.

comment,1hq6gib,1hq6gib,,"There's a few factors at play here.

1) the median age of vehicles on the road in the US is over 12 years. Half of then are therefore pretty close to several decades old and in various states of repair.

2) accident rate increases with the age of the vehicle. Older vehicles are therefore over-represented in calls for service by first responders.

3) Older vehicles on average are less safe before you even factor in any age related degradation.


The result is something of a bias that doesn't necessarily reflect the reality of cars built in the last few years. The Model Y has a very strong roof structure. Ioniq 5's roof strength tested within 5% of the Y. Both are demonstrably very safe vehicles.

There is an impact of vehicle geometry to consider though as well. Ioniq 5 has a much closer to vertical rear gate/window which may have resulted in more of a rear collision rather than one that skidded up the Y and landed on the roof. That could be no big deal or it could be worse. There's not really a way for us to know. Oddly enough IIHS does not do any rear impact testing.

Tldr; Modern cars, especially EVs, are all quite safe. Different cars behave differently though so there's no way to really know which is better for a specific accident.",1255,False,1735653908.0,2024-12-31 15:05:08,14,0,zackplanet42,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1hq6gib/the_glass_roof_is_no_joke_a_truck_rear_ended_a/m4oy7xs/,True,,2024,tesla,top,False,False,0,m4oy7xs

What do you think it takes to get a fab running? A couple years, concrete, some low skill workers, and the requisite machines manufactured by ASML in the Netherlands? You would be thoroughly wrong if you said yes to that second question. First, just designing the building needs to take into account the need for near perfect operating conditions for the clean rooms and the other various environments necessary to produce chips from silicon wafers. If expedited, this could destroy entire batches of chips due to mild changes in weather or seismic activity, if not bring down the entire facility for an extended period of time. So that work needs to be perfect. You will note a running theme here that every single aspect of these facilities need to be effectively perfect for them to work. They are producing incredibly complex structures on the order of NANOMETERS. That requires unfathomable precision, which in turn requires eternally, completely stable operating conditions. Taking into account American sign-off processes from a bureaucratic standpoint, and the fact that American construction routinely cuts corners, TSMC would need to constantly oversee their entire building process and additionally lube the gears of the federal and local government to make this process work.",4501,True,1738073186.0,2025-01-28 15:06:26,28,0,homelessness_is_evil,investing,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ic0kp2/trump_announces_chip_tariffs_up_to_100/m9my7gb/,True,,2025,tesla,top,False,False,0,m9my7gb

post,1ie1jty,,Finally did it. Out with the Tesla.,"
Hey Everyone,

I have been a Tesla model y driver the last three years. My lease was up and due to recent developments with Elon and the staleness of having a Tesla (including a model 3 before) for the last 5 years; it was time for a change. 

Last night I made the jump and signed a lease of a 2024 Equinox EV 2RS all black. My lease isn’t up for a month and I just went to look and test drive anyway. I drove it and was blown away. It feels remarkably similar to my Dual Motor model Y but the interior quality was better. Loved every bit of it. It even has super cruise. The only option it’s lacking that I wish it had is the panoramic sunroof. 

I feel like I got a great deal (I negotiated pretty hard). 24 month lease with $315 per month lease with $0 down, 10,000 miles. All in all, spending $120 less per month than my Tesla. Very happy!

post,1iejost,,Tesla: The Company is One Giant Lie,"
Tesla just posted abysmal earnings, and how does Elon respond? With another song and dance about robots and self-driving cars—fairy tales he’s been spinning for years with no real results. Meanwhile, the fundamentals are crumbling: declining margins, demand issues, and brutal price cuts just to move inventory.

This company has been built on hype, not substance. FSD is nowhere near what was promised, Cybertruck is a disaster, and now they’re leaning on AI pipe dreams to distract from the financial mess. 

When a catalyst hits this, downward price action will be the most drastic in history. ",598,False,1738343423.0,2025-01-31 18:10:23,15038,1612,[deleted],stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iejost/tesla_the_company_is_one_giant_lie/,True,0.9,2025,both,top,False,False,0,

Smart fundamental analysts know this. Even Bill Gates a man who basically invented the modern software empire, thought he could out logic the hype train bubble. He shorted Tesla… and boom he lost $1.5 billion. The market didn’t care about fundamentals. It cared about the story and the story is the Elon hype.

And who’s the greatest storyteller of our time? Elon Musk. The man could stand on stage and say, “We’ll have a million robotaxis next year,” and the stock jumps 10%. Do we have robotaxis? Nope. But do we have belief? Absolutely.

Tesla isn’t just a car company it’s a hype engine with wheels.

The adjustable air suspension and real torque vectoring make it handle beautifully. Fit and finish is better. 

Polestar is based in, designed, and engineered Sweden with obvious sharing with Volvo. Geely is their largest investor but from my understanding it is not involved in the day to day operations. They own Lotus as well. The car is built in South Carolina.

post,1j7l0bv,,TSLA being investigated by Transport Canada for cooking their books in Canada to snag EV rebates without selling cars.,"The article notes that **four Tesla dealerships claimed to have sold 8,653 Teslas in 3 days.** Assuming each dealership opens from 9AM-5PM, that's **90 cars sold per hour per dealership**. Worth noting that Canada's EV rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how Tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did...

Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M.

I guess that's one way to maintain revenue while sales drop 90%!

Note: investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation of official wrongdoing yet.

Edit: Since this post got more attention then I expected. Yes I posted this Sunday and TSLA is currently down 13% today. However I do not think this is causing the drop, and rather it’s an overall market pull back from trade wars and from Europe sales declines. The article was published Friday morning and Tesla was up 3% by end of Friday.

Elon had access to angel investors partially because he did an internship at the Bank of Nova Scotia, where he apparently was able to pitch ideas up the chain to the CEO. You know, normal stuff that poor nobodies with no connections get to do when they do an internship. 

So with a bunch of investors, Elon and three co-founders start X(dot)com. Within a few months, Elon fired one of the co-founders and the other two quit as a result. X(dot)com sucked so bad at banking that:

>In January 2000, it was discovered that a security flaw allowed users of X(dot)com who had the account number and bank routing number of any other bank account, even at other banks, could move money from that other account to their own and withdraw it. The problem existed for a month before it was discovered and corrected. 

And they had a competitor company that did know what they were doing, and was going to beat them, so guess what they did. Elon used his rich friends to just buy up the competitor.

comment,1j9jxzj,1j9jxzj,,"So there's two aspects to this:

The first is that all companies are run by people, and it's a completely natural and right that the people in charge of other EV companies would be horrified by Musk and his antics. The proper human response to nascent fascism is revulsion and opposition.

The second though is that companies get anthromorphized by consumers/audiences so that people see communications from that company (like ads and brand-managed social media posts) as coming from a *person*, rather than a company. People can have very personal responses to this - and interestingly, there is a large segment of the human population that is conflict-adverse over all else. Getting involved in a fight, *even if the cause is righteous* is seen as being ""just as bad"" as fighting for an evil cause. It is the *fight* that is wrong, irrespective of the root cause of the fight. 

So there is significant risk of alienating a large portion of your customer base with potential spillover to sales - and as the role of a company is always to make money, there is risk that standing up for what's right will see you punished financially.

This is the heart of ""Go woke, go broke"" (although that phrase is intended to be a threat; it isn't an axiom).

I considered the Ioniq 5, EV9, F150 Lightning, Polestar 3, Mach E, Mercedes EQS.

Some of the other EVs DEFAULT to no regen or low regen. And they never remember your regen settings when you get in, you have to hit the paddles every time! I'm looking at you Kia and Hyundai!

I was not a fan of the software for the F150, Mach E or Mercedes. The layout of the Rivian infotainment is akin to modern tablet OS and has a native spotify app like Tesla. I can even google cast to it, which could arguably be easier than the native youtube app on Tesla. I can cast crunchyroll animes!

The stock is headed for an ninth-straight weekly loss, and now sits 53% below the all-time highs reached in mid-December.

As each day passes, the list of headwinds facing the EV maker seems to grow. In addition to existing pressures, Tesla on Tuesday faced fresh competition from China and an analyst price-target cut.

Below are four forces — two new, two evergreen — driving the acceleration in Tesla’s share-price decline.

1. BYD’s new battery tech

The Chinese firm BYD unveiled an EV-charging station that it claims can deliver up to 400 kilometers driving range after just five minutes of charging. This would be a big step up from current charging technology, with Tesla’s quickest version providing a 275-kilometer range after 15 minutes of charging.

The development creates another headwind for Tesla as it tries to break into Chinese market.

BYD plans to build 4,000 of these chargers across China.

2. Wall Street scaling back forecasts

Though RBC maintains an “outperform” rating on Tesla, it cut its price target to $320 from $440.

The analyst Tom Narayan expects lower pricing on Tesla’s full self-driving technology as autonomous offerings become increasingly standard across the EV industry.

But over the past few months, something shifted. Call it a growing discomfort, or for lack of a better word, the ick.

The final straw? The Rose Garden shoot. A week later, as I sat at a red light, it hit me—I simply couldn’t drive this car anymore, no matter how impressive it was.

And so, today, I say goodbye. I won’t be buying a Tesla again. For those curious, Carvana was about 2K more than Lucid trade in offer and Carmax/KBB. Still sold at a loss, yes, I realize my privilege saying that. Lucid is now offering a 2K Tesla Trade-In bonus on select states that makes it more compelling even if the Carvana price is better but I just went for the simplicity of trading in with them.

comment,1jfw22y,1jfw22y,,"Rivian delivered 51,579 vehicles in 2024. 13,423 were RDVs, so 38,156 R1T and R1S, but mostly R1S. That's 9,539 a quarter on average. 2023 had largely similar numbers (50k total), 2022 had 25k total deliveries. That's somewhere around 90k making some SWAGs about RDVs since it's generally hard to figure out. The biggest problem with all of this is there's several R1Ss sold for every R1T.

Ford sold 33,510 lightnings in 2024 or 8,377 a quarter. Add 2022 (15.6k) and 2023 (24k) sales and about 73k lightnings have been sold on an upward trend.

TL;DR: There are more R1 vehicles than cybertrucks but more cybertrucks than R1Ts. Lightnings appear to generally be the best selling EV truck. Cybertrucks briefly outsold everyone, peaking at a rate of 15k a quarter for at least a month but that seems to have ended.

ETA: using the 1:3 ratio of R1S:R1T from the report linked by SPorterBridges, that's roughly 31k R1Ts, probably the 46k cybertrucks from the recall and. 73k lightnings, and 126k total R1 vehicles.

#Trump’s Aggression Sours Europe on US Cloud Giants

###Companies in the EU are starting to look for ways to ditch Amazon, Google, and Microsoft cloud services amid fears of rising security risks from the US. But cutting ties won’t be easy.

> The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti–Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.

> There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies’ cloud services—including servers, storage, and databases—citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.

> “There’s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,” says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.

> The moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become “more technologically independent” and saying the status quo creates “security and reliability risks.",8585,True,1742802557.0,2025-03-24 08:49:17,10136,641,YourFuture2000,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jilfwg/companies_in_the_eu_are_starting_to_look_for_ways/,True,0.97,2025,both,top,False,False,0,

""Canada has frozen $43 million in payments to Tesla pending a line-by-line investigation into its last-minute surge in EV rebate claims made on the final weekend of the government program.

The American EV maker run by U.S. presidential adviser Elon Musk will also be excluded from all future EV rebate programs as long as tariffs are in place, former transport minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement.

The stop-payment order appears to have been made before the current election was called Sunday, though Freeland only confirmed it Tuesday, while on the campaign trail for her University—Rosedale seat.

“As soon as I became Transport Minister, I asked the department to stop all payments for Tesla vehicles in order to fully examine each claim individually and determine whether all are eligible and valid. No payments will be made until we are confident that the claims are valid,” she said in a statement texted to the Star.

“I also directed my department to change the eligibility criteria for future iZEV programs to ensure that Tesla vehicles will not be eligible for incentive programs so long as the illegitimate and illegal U.S. tariffs are imposed against Canada.”""

For me, I absolutely despise the fact that if I want to go faster, I have to change the behavior to standard or hurry, but then it makes more lane changes. All I want, and probably most everyone, is the ability to have the card drive faster while still keeping lane changes minimal. On top of that, there are times I wanted to stay in the left lane or the right lane, but it will constantly make changes to stay out of those lanes, which is infuriating. No matter how good it gets, we will also have preferences on where we want to be. 

Aside from all that, my commute has one toll I want to take and several I don’t want to take and I’m not able to do this without turning FSD on and off or stop navigating to a certain destination.

post,1jq4hf3,,US Senate passed bill by slim margin in a 51-48 vote to block Trump's tariffs on imports from Canada,"4 Republicans cross the floor to vote with Democrats to pass a bill that would remove import tariffs on Canadian goods.

This still needs to pass the house (which has republican majority), and even if it passes the house, president can still veto. At which point it goes back to the senate and 2/3 need to vote to overturn the veto.

Low chance, but indication that dissent is happening within party lines given the economic downturn of tariff policy.

Interesting to see how many more house reps and senators break from party lines after today's ""liberation"" tariffs have time to impact markets and consumer prices

post,1jqyy5b,,US Equities lost 90%-and took 25 years to recover.,"Everyone is saying ""dip dip dip"" as if we are experiencing an overreaction to a small segment bubble. 

95 years ago the US levied the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, worldwide tariffs that were designed to encourage domestic production and punish ""cheating countries"". This kicked off a trade war that had no small part in causing a world-wide depression. 

The US has not levied global tariffs of this degree since then. Until yesterday.

What happened to US equities?  After a roaring bull run during which wealth was printed and the every-day man flung money in the market it crashed. But not overnight. In fits and starts the DJI lost 90% of its value over a 3 year period. 

It took *25* years for it to return to an ATH. 

Trump has fired 10s of thousands of federal employees. He's spiking unemployment. He's taxing imports to the tune of 50-100%. Other countries will do the same to us. Our companies will start having mass layoffs, crushing economic activity and investment. Domestic production will not return, everyone one will be out of money to buy stuff anyways. The SH tariffs did nothing to encourage domestic manufacturing, it just made everyone poorer. 

Maybe our monetary policy will prevent a Great Depression and we escape with ""only"" 8-10 percent unemployment, mild stagflation and the market takes 3-5 years to recover after a 50% fall.
 
I'd love to hear the thesis of *why* the market will recover or be higher in the next 12-24 months when we have a historical model staring us in the face.

i don't like trump at all and think that his economic model is absolutely stupid. but i also feel like comparing the great depression and the DJI tanking 90% isn't good history... like trump use of mckinley when it comes to tariffs. 

the global market (and regulation too) is far past the point of a great depression happening. while the US is doing it's best to outright gut everything in regulation, in 1930s america there was practically no social net, no digital economy, no FDIC, not even fucking social security lmfao. that is why the smoot-hawley furthered the depression into unimaginable levels.

comment,1jqyy5b,1jqyy5b,,">All these companies are going to see their share of business done outside the United States plummet

I do wonder about this. For the most part, anyone outside the US doing business with Apple and Google and Microsoft aren't trading with those companies' US entities; they're contracting with legal entities in Ireland or elsewhere. There is no part of an iPhone that is made in the US except the IP, and that can be transfer priced in very creative ways. AWS and Microsoft have data centres all over the world. Everything NVIDIA makes is physically produced in Taiwan. And Teslas sold in Australia (rapid sales volume drop notwithstanding) are built in China. 

These companies (except maybe Tesla) aren't stupid. None of them are going to want to go down with the ship, and they will find ways to protect their interests. And customers are mostly rational too: Unless Tim Cook starts doing Musk salutes nobody is setting their iPhone on fire.

comment,1jtlvn7,1jtlvn7,,"From the article: Tesla has made a significant update to its Safety Score, removing one of the most controversial metrics – Forward Collision Warnings (FCW)- from the system’s formula. The removal of FCW comes as the company is dealing with a potential class action lawsuit claiming the metric artificially inflated insurance premiums.

Tesla first introduced its Safety Score system to Tesla Insurance in 2021. The system uses real-time driving telemetry to determine scores for several metrics, such as Hard Braking, Aggressive Turning, and more, all of which combine into one overall Safety Score. This score is then used to determine your monthly Tesla Insurance premiums. If you have a good, or high, Safety Score you get a lower insurance premium than someone who has a low Safety Score.

There was one metric that was particularly controversial, and that was FCW. According to Tesla, FCWs were triggered “in events where a possible collision due to an object in front of the vehicle is considered likely without driver intervention.” However, ask any Tesla owner and they will say the FCW system is far from perfect, often giving out false positives when there was no real danger of a collision.

It was enough of a problem that one owner from Illinois filed a potential class action lawsuit against the company, claiming customers were being overcharged on their monthly insurance premiums based on these false warnings.",1738,True,1744034353.0,2025-04-07 15:59:13,80,0,chrisdh79,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1jtlvn7/tesla_removes_forward_collision_warnings_from/mlv432s/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mlv432s

comment,1jtlvn7,1jtlvn7,,"Good, FCW is worthless for this purpose. Don't get me wrong, as a safety feature it's great, and it SHOULD be generally over-protective.

But if you use it to determine premiums, it has to be near-perfect, and arguably it should err towards false negative rather than false positives, which is what it does today.

In our neighborhood, there are a few lazily-curving streets with parallel parking, and even taking it at/below the 15-25mph speed limit, each day we get 4-5 FCW panic beeps from the Model X as it reliably mistakes a parked car on the side of the road for one it thinks we are going to hit, even though that car is clearly off the projected path.

The last 5% is what took Waymo and others years and years to close that gap. This is one field where the last 5% takes 95% of the time.

If you are experiencing *any* disengagement at all, then it's years away from where it needs to be to be fully autonomous on public roads.

If one day the whole Tesla community are all saying they are not seeing *any* disengagement for months at a time, then we know we are close.

comment,1jtv8dx,1jtv8dx,,"That's incorrect. The accident rate while manually driving is actually much higher than the accident rate while using FSD. Why? Because not only has FSD itself become a much more competent driver over time, but also because you can intervene when necessary, and it effectively becomes like having two sets of eyes and brains driving at the same time, where one can catch the other's mistakes. So if you were truly concerned about your life and other people's lives, you'd want to be using FSD. It is factually safer than manually driving.

Also, you're acting as if you must fully rely on FSD. No, you can take over. Eventually it will be good enough where you can fully rely on it, but we're not there yet. It's called ""FSD (Supervised)"" right now for a reason.",762,False,1744095463.0,2025-04-08 08:57:43,6,0,ChunkyThePotato,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1jtv8dx/tesla_press_fsd_supervised_button_your_tesla/mlzvqvh/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mlzvqvh

This is why. The software is more about owner and driver convenience. All small things but ends up being death by a thousand cuts when you have to use another vehicle. I get a daily reminder of it between my Model Y and my Bolt.


Sentry/dashcam is an obvious one as you mentioned. All cars are wrapped in cameras now, they should have this.


Having unlimited driver profiles is nice. Can keep mirror, seat, and other vehicle settings even for people who only occasionally drive. Saving my vent position is icing on top. Being able to load my profile on any tesla is kinda magical.


A lot of it is app connectivity features, like being able to remotely start seat heaters, open and close windows. Or being able to precondition and auto set navigation based on my calendar.


And simple software stuff like carwash mode that just automates a bunch of checks you'd have to do manually. Or maintenance stuff like being able to automatically sync tire sensors without needing a special tool.


Plus regularly getting new features as software updates. Even just today they added the ability to save how high the trunk opens based on GPS location.",1188,False,1744418903.0,2025-04-12 02:48:23,36,0,iceynyo,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1jx0mud/teslas_us_sales_are_worse_than_what_is_reported/mmnqgcz/,True,,2025,tesla,top,False,False,0,mmnqgcz

post,1jyagqg,,TSM: My Highest Conviction Buy — Despite the Tariff and China Risk,"Hi all, 

I have been following TSMC for years, and it is my highest conviction buy...even in the tariff situation. TSMC has a technical monopoly on the most advanced chips in the world. TSMC has pricing power, and the demand for those chips will explode, driven by the increased demand for AI, cloud services and EV adoption. 

I value the shares at $338, more than double the current price. The opportunity exists because the market is discounting the stock price to account for the China and tariffs risks. The market thinks China taking over Taiwan is a real risk. I believe that the risk is overblown as the US won’t allow China to conquer Taiwan.

Any thoughts?

post,1jyghal,,Tariffs are back on Trump says!,"**Trump on Truth Social**: NOBODY is getting “off the hook” for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst! There was no Tariff “exception” announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff “bucket.” The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER! The Golden Age of America, which includes the upcoming Tax and Regulation Cuts, a substantial amount of which was just approved by the House and Senate, will mean more and better paying Jobs, making products in our Nation, and treating other Countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us. The bottom line is that our Country will be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

This is why you don't believe any news over the weekend unless Trump or the White House covers on it. Tariffs are back on now!

Tire wear will not be inaccurate by a factor of 2.

They also claim that their normal daily drive distance suddenly spiked from 55 miles per day up to like 75 as their warranty was approaching its end.

The claim isn't ""oh noes it's not a physically measured odometer!"". The claim is that it is deliberately inaccurate. If that's true, it could end up being a huge lawsuit. Your insurance rates are often tied to your expected annual driving distance as conveyed by your odometer.

post,1k5g9yj,,Tesla reports disappointing quarterly results as automotive revenue plunges 20%,"Tesla reported a miss on the top and bottom lines in its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday as automotive revenue plunged 20% from a year earlier.

Here are the key numbers compared with LSEG expectations.

* **Earnings per share**: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated
* **Revenue**: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

It’s been a brutal start to the year for Tesla, with CEO Elon Musk spending much of his time in President Donald Trump’s White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. The president’s sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment, automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells.

Tesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday.

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

In its shareholder deck, Tesla cautioned investors that “uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers.",3889,True,1745352789.0,2025-04-22 22:13:09,13947,974,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k5g9yj/tesla_reports_disappointing_quarterly_results_as/,True,0.96,2025,both,top,False,False,0,

But objectively speaking, Waymo is currently driving autonomously, while Tesla is not.

All of this stuff about ""scalability"" is just a momentary distraction.  Sure, tesla has shown they can build factories, and pump out vehicles at scale.  But how many Cybercabs have been mass produced to date?

Maybe the calculus changes in two or three years.

post,1kbesxa,,I talked with a Chinese factory owner to see what’s happening on the ground. TL;DR: China has mobilized tons of resources to exporters but there’s some signs of pain,"I’m an American in China but have been seeing very little foreign reporting about what’s happening in China, which is weird to me because it seems pretty important to get a clear picture of the trade war. So here’s what I learned from him.

**Gov support**

-The local government is helping and giving him low interest rate loans / short term financial support. This type of thing is very common throughout China right now - lots of local govs are mobilizing to support exporters thru the tariff war. Li Qiang, central gov minister, says central government help is probably coming too 

-Guangzhou, and I assume others too, has also organized tons of seminars since Liberation Day with buyers from Europe, Latin America, and Asia. A big source of replacement demand for his factory has been from these

-He’s getting lots of buyers from TikTok shops overseas. It seems like TikTok is helping a lot to mitigate the demand impact 

-The news story of Walmart, Target, Costco, etc. resuming some orders is true, he confirmed it. But the amounts are **very, very** small

**Pain**

-He’s already re-evaluating employees and firing some soon. He said most exporters in Guangzhou are cutting some employees, but extremely US dependent exporters have furloughed most of their workforces until mid May

**Some good news for the U.S?**

-Before Liberation Day he was building a factory in the US and has now fully committed to it. But it’s having issues since the raw materials are sourced from China and they’re getting hit with tariffs

[The full interview is here](https://www.yaphete.com/p/live-from-the-trade-war-2-chinas), I didn’t write everything here. Knowing the relative strength and ability of China or the US to withstand the tariff war is super important to trading right now I believe",1790,False,1746014813.0,2025-04-30 14:06:53,3562,427,TheOneTrueThrowaway1,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kbesxa/i_talked_with_a_chinese_factory_owner_to_see/,True,0.97,2025,tesla,top,False,False,0,

post,1kn8bij,,Why Industry Maps Matter 🗺️ A Closer Look at Gaming 🕹️ - Asking for Feedback,"**tl;dr**

* I'm working on my newsletter and trying to level up the **visual content** around investing.
* I picked the **gaming industry** 🕹️— one of the stronger-performing megatrend pockets in the market.
* I've made a couple of **industry maps** 🗺️ to help make sense of it.
* Personally, I like the depth of **Map 1**, but I also created a **simpler version (Map 2)** for a quick overview.
* **I'd love your feedback** — what's missing, what's overkill, what you'd change.
* I'm also thinking about a benchmarking slide deck: revenue growth, margins, ROIC, and shareholder returns.
* There's a ton of great content out there — deep-dive writeups, podcasts, CEO interviews. I might curate the best stuff — would that be useful?
* What else do you think would help retail or professional investors get a better grip on this space?
* I plan to cover other industries that benefit from secular tailwinds using the same framework, so I want to make sure it's actually useful and relevant.

comment,1kqg2i5,1kqg2i5,,"Retaining 90% capacity after 7000 hours of cycling at 40C would be incredible.

For reference, my 2.5 year old LFP Model 3 is already down to around 94-96% capacity, depending on how you measure, after only 631 hours of driving, which equates to 23.5k miles. So 7000 hours of cycling is probably in the 200k-300k miles ballpark, potentially more if you do mostly highway driving.

Edit: I should note, however, that even for current LFP batteries, most of the degradation seems to be from calendar aging, not cyclical (usage-based) aging, so other LFP Tesla owners with 2.5 year old cars likely have similar remaining capacity to me, regardless of whether they drove 5k miles or 50k miles.

comment,1krw9j8,1krw9j8,,"From the article: Elon Musk says he intends to remain CEO of Tesla for at least the next five years, while saying the company is not experience issues with demand, expect in one market. The comments came during a video interview at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday, where Musk responded to questions about his political involvement, leadership at Tesla, and the company’s recent sales figures.

When asked directly if he saw himself continuing as Tesla’s CEO in five years’ time, Musk answered with a simple “Yes.” Pressed further, he added with a laugh, “I can’t be still here if I’m dead.”

Musk’s statements on his continued leadership comes amid growing scrutiny over his political ties and time commitments to projects beyond Tesla, including the U.S. government’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Along with his involvement in DOGE, Musk has donated at least $250 million in support of Trump’s re-election campaign, but that appears to be over, at least for now. Musk said, “I’ve done enough. If I see a reason to do political spending I will, but I don’t currently see a reason.

I do wonder where Tesla would be now if the Cybertruck carried on the winning formula of the Model 3 - make the most cost efficient decisions to create the best value EV for the mass market.

It's like buying a first edition land cruiser with $23k of dealer accessories and $8k of markup and then complaining about ""depreciation"" a year later when supply has caught up and you can get one OTD for under MSRP, doesn't make it any more or less successful of a truck for toyota.

post,1ktchqb,,The Lamborghini of Nauru's Police Chief?,"Seeking information regarding a Lamborghini reportedly located on the island nation of Nauru near Australia.

During a period of economic prosperity on Nauru, a story emerged about a police chief (or official) who acquired a Lamborghini. This individual was reportedly too large to comfortably operate the vehicle.

Request: Does anyone have factual information regarding this specific Lamborghini? This includes details such as the model year, any known history, or its current status. Photographic evidence would also be of interest.

I was able to find a BBC article mentioning it from 2008 mentioning it, but that was all I was able to find. Does anyone know which model it was, or what ended up happening to it? This would have been late 70's early 80's most likely. So possibly a Countach or Jalpa.

post,1ktfc9f,,"The Doha interview confirmed that car sales are still Tesla's anchor, and Musk is trying hard to blur this anchor.The crisis is coming quiet","The Doha interview confirmed that car sales are still Tesla's anchor, and Musk is trying hard to blur this anchor. He also hopes that investors will look to ten years later.

As an investor, it is very important to look forward to a better future, because this is the basic concept of investment. However, this does not mean that we only look at the future and not the fundamentals of a company, that is, the main business. Not to mention what if this so-called future is unreliable? This interview can confirm that Saudi investors are very dissatisfied with the sales of his cars, which is Musk's most hated topic. After all, he has said that he doesn't like the car business anymore, and he wants to make cooler Robotaxi, robots, and FSD. And these are all far away.

I know that many Tesla fans have been insisting on proving to everyone how great FSD is. But you know, although many people have shown that FSD can travel 300KM, even across the east and west of the United States without human intervention once. But on the NHTSA registration list, it is L2 autonomous driving. I even wonder why NHTSA allows FSD to be approved without holding the steering wheel. After all, it is only L2 instead of L3 or L4. Of course, this is not important. What is important is that the foundation of FSD today is not enough to support Robotaxi.

I have also met Tesla fans who told me, ""If FSD really doesn't work, at most we can add a lidar, which is not a difficult task."" When I used the logic of business school to analyze it for them, when lidar is added, the competitors will become WAYMO, and WAYMO has been leading for 5 years in using lidar and getting L4, so Tesla will have to catch up.

Tesla fans said contemptuously, ""So what, does WAYMO have a rocket? Can it take us to Mars?""

In the past, Musk could always say Next Year, but when Next Year has arrived, what should he do? Forever Mars plan?

Paywall: [https://www.ft.com/content/a9cd130f-f6bf-4750-98cc-19d87394e657](https://www.ft.com/content/a9cd130f-f6bf-4750-98cc-19d87394e657)

Oracle will spend around $40bn on Nvidia’s high-performance computer chips to power OpenAI’s new giant US data centre, as tech groups race to build the vast infrastructure needed to underpin artificial intelligence models.

The site in Abilene, Texas, has been billed as the first US Stargate project, the $500bn data centre scheme spearheaded by OpenAI and SoftBank, and will provide 1.2 gigawatts of power when it is completed next year, making it one of the largest in the world.

Oracle will purchase around 400,000 of Nvidia’s GB200 chips — its latest “superchip” for training and running AI systems — and lease the computing power to OpenAI, according to several people familiar with the matter.

The site’s owners, Crusoe and US investment firm Blue Owl Capital, have raised $15bn in debt and equity to finance the Abilene project, which will encompass eight buildings and first broke ground in June last year.

The data centre is expected to be fully operational by mid-2026. Oracle has agreed to lease the site for 15 years. Stargate, which incorporated earlier this year, has not invested in the site.

post,1kttun7,,BRK.B vs S&P500 after Warren Buffett's retirement?,"As soon as the old man announced his retirement, Berkshire Hathaway collapsed and is still in free fall.  
  
What do you think, is it worth some money left here for 5 years? Or is it safer with SP?  
  
BRK has had a much higher return in recent years.   
The biggest risk is that it currently has a very large amount of uninvested cash. In case that money suddenly withdraws from inside, the price will fall aggressively in my opinion.  
The investment probably presents a little more risk if we take it that way, but it cannot be ignored that frequently while other stocks have collapsed, BRK has continued to grow.  
Many have also trusted this because they usually have wet dreams with Buffett and his direct implication with the company.  
  
Alternatives to these with lower risks if you want faster growth than SP500, I think it would be Amazon which will definitely grow because people keep buying, Tesla with potential but with the risk that it will remain constant and will not go up too much, because their business is going well in the States, but not in Europe at the moment and ... Nvidia which has grown more than it should in the last year, a big collapse is expected in case their AI business does not work out, the only thing that could still lift them.

* **Tesla (TSLA)**: As you mentioned, they’re working on *Optimus*, a humanoid robot. Still early-stage, but backed by Tesla’s capital and vision.
* **Hyundai** (via Boston Dynamics): Although Hyundai is listed in Korea, acquiring Boston Dynamics puts them in a strong position in advanced mobility robots.
* **Figure AI**: Still private, but very promising in humanoid robotics. Backed by Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia.

# 2. Industrial robotics

This is currently the most mature and profitable segment:

* **ABB Ltd (ABB)**: Swiss company with a global presence in automation and industrial robotics.
* **Fanuc (FANUY)**: Japanese leader in industrial robotics, especially factory automation.
* **Yaskawa Electric (YASKY)**: Another major Japanese player focused on automation and industrial robots.
* **KUKA**: German robotics company now owned by China's Midea Group, so not directly listed.
* **Rockwell Automation (ROK)**: More focused on automation but includes key robotics components for smart factories.

# 3. Other related areas

* **Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)**: Leader in medical robotics with its Da Vinci surgical system.
* **iRobot (IRBT)**: Known for Roomba. Less cutting-edge, but still robotics-related.
* **Nvidia (NVDA)**: Doesn’t build robots but provides critical AI and computer vision hardware/software (Jetson, CUDA, etc.).
* **KEYENCE (KYCCF)**: Specializes in sensors and industrial automation—key for robotic systems.

Amazon already has a home robot on the market for $1000 that they can use to train their programming and scale up in cost and functionality. They already have Alexa and ring in people's helping train the AI to work more effectively. 

 To me that makes them the clear front runner. Even if Tesla offers one for $20k, Amazon might be able to offer something comparable for $10,000, have more integration, and have a much better platform to get it to people at a lower cost. 

I'm also not sold on the viability of a $20,000 robot that does dishes and laundry  for 99% of Americans. Its like.

post,1ku94ha,,Trying to Learn – How Do You Short Tesla Smarter?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve taken a few shots at shorting TSLA recently—some decent reads, but I keep getting caught by timing issues or stop-losses. One example: a few days ago I set my sell order at $355, but the stock topped out at $354.99 and never triggered. Then it dropped hard, and I missed the trade completely.

I currently hold small positions in Alphabet-C, Apple, Nvidia, gold, and REITs—so I’m mostly flat now and just watching the market.

Looking to learn and improve.

1. What strategies or indicators do you use when shorting Tesla?

2. How do you avoid getting stop-hunted or missing entries by a few cents?

3. Any good risk-management habits I should adopt?

comment,1ku94ha,1ku94ha,,"Shorting TSLA has been my best investment ever. Here are my tricks.


1) Don't literally short it. Buy ETFs like TSLS, TSLZ, and TSLQ. I prefer the 1x ETFs unless I have extremely high conviction. 


2) Be patient. Really patient. Wait for it to hit overbought areas on the RSI. Don't chase bad days.


3) Take your gains. TSLA always throws out some bullshit eventually so if you are up a decent amount on the day or week just take the win. Do not hold long.


4) Watch the news. Pay attention to macro and micro things that impact the market. If there is an overall bull sentiment, TSLA will go up. Don't fight it. Just wait for it to get overbought. Understand when TSLA sales numbers come out, and when earnings are coming up.


5) Never hold through earnings. At least not your full position. You can trade during ER but don't hold through. TSLA usually sells off slowly ahead of earnings and bad news gets ""priced in"". That's why it bounces back.


6) Pretend like TSLA is in fact a $400 or $500 stock and ignore logic. Everything will make more sense. If it sells off to $200 it will seem like it can go lower (it might), but make your decisions assuming the dumbest and most corrupt rich people in the world think it's a $500 stock.


7) Learn about and follow options max pain. Google it. Tesla options are heavily traded.

BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) -Nvidia will launch a new artificial intelligence chipset for China at a significantly lower price than its recently restricted H20 model and plans to start mass production as early as June, sources familiar with the matter said.

The GPU or graphics processing unit will be part of Nvidia's latest generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors and is expected to be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, well below the $10,000-$12,000 the H20 sold for, according to two of the sources.

The lower price reflects its weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements.

It will be based on Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a server-class graphics processor and will use conventional GDDR7 memory instead of more advanced high bandwidth memory, the two sources said.

They added it would not use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's advanced Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology.

The new chip's price, specifications and production timing have not previously been reported.

The three sources Reuters spoke to for this article declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to media.

An Nvidia spokesperson said the company was still evaluating its ""limited"" options. ""Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China's $50 billion data center market.""

post,1kum63j,,How bad can it get when crypto goes POOF?,"Right now there is about 3 trillion market cap in crypto, which is making a lot of people feel significantly richer than they are. supposing crypto market cap goes to near zero, I do not think there has ever been a wealth destruction event like that ever in the history of markets. I think it could have significant impacts on the global economy, causing a very real financial crisis.

AI is probably in a bubble as well, there are very obvious stocks at the very least which are beyond reason, such as tesla and Palantir.

These seem to be a staple in the modern portfolio, and could contribute to an even greater loss of the wealth effect.

the wealth effect would further deteriorate as multiple compression occurs across the board in a bear market.

A lot of people will probably pile on here saying that crypto wont go to zero, but factually there is only one use for blockchain technology right now and that would be a CBDC. CBDC would not have anything to do with the current coins which are being treated as ponzi schemes, and would not be related to the likes of tether or USDC. As matter of fact tether and USDC would likely stop existing as liquidity for them would dry up in an event where there is no coins to gamble on outside of them.

Is the next great financial crisis going to play out something like this? and when will it occur? Historically in great bubbles they were nearing an end when political figures were stoking the fire for personal gain. It is not hard to see this playing out right now. A lot of people find comfort that there is greater acceptance of crypto, but in fact it is a sign that the party is nearing its end. History rhymes.

A significant majority of the democratic subset won’t buy Tesla while Musk is still involved. A minority of that group, however, will still buy if the car is good and it makes sense economically. 

Republicans aren’t a very EV-friendly group but I suspect those who will buy an EV will look at Tesla very favorably considering Musk’s massive investments in getting Republicans elected. 

The dgaf politically group will buy whatever car makes sense for them. There might be a small % that will hesitate due to the whole “Roman” salute situation but it’s likely a very small subset since the mainstream media basically shrugged it off.

**Key Takeaways**

* Nvidia's scheduled earnings Wednesday highlight the tech financial reports calendar this week, along with quarterly updates from Salesforce, Marvell Technologies, Dell, and HP. Other noteworthy reports expected include retailers Costco, AutoZone, and Dick’s Sporting Goods.
* Friday’s PCE inflation report will provide insight into price pressure in April, while investors will also be following updates to first-quarter GDP, the U.S. trade balance, and consumer confidence.
* Federal Reserve officials set to speak this week include Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller and New York Fed President John Williams, coming as the Fed is scheduled to release the minutes from its May meeting.

Nvidia (NVDA) earnings and a key inflation report highlight this week’s holiday-shortened calendar as investors continue to evaluate the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and economic policies.

Tech companies Salesforce (CRM), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Dell Technologies (DELL), and HP (HPQ) are expected to deliver earnings this week. Market watchers will also be looking for reports from retailers Costco Wholesale (COST), AutoZone (AZO), Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS), and Temu parent PDD Holdings (PDD).

The reports are set to arrive after a down week for stocks, which was punctuated Friday by a revival of trade-related uncertainty. You can recap last week's trading here.

In addition to Friday's personal consumption expenditures inflation report on Friday, investors will also be tuned into first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) updates and the latest data on the U.S. trade balance and retail inventories. Consumer confidence and sentiment surveys also will be in focus.

Several Fed officials are on the speaking calendar, including Federal Reserve Gov.",7347,True,1748178984.0,2025-05-25 15:16:24,71,4,callsonreddit,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kv2as8/what_to_expect_in_the_markets_this_week_may_2730/,True,0.92,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kv2htl,,Elon says he's back to work 24/7; bullish on TSLA,"So obviously after Elon hurt his reputation/brand after extremely unpopular political activities, it took a major outage at X dot com to result in this:

> “Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms,” Musk wrote in a post on X on Saturday replying to news of outages on the platform. “I must be super focused on X/xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.”

For me this is extremely bullish as his involvement with TSLA was the main driver for its success & stock price. 

Having Elon back to work at Tesla is going to get those products out the door, especially robi taxi & those dancing robots.. I know it sounds comical but I see 100s of millions of people buying these robots.

I disable the FSD when it tries to switch lanes, and a minute or two later as soon as I turn it back on, it instantly tries switching lanes again with no cars in front of me yet so many vehicles in the lanes it tries to change to. This might be the most frustrating thing, but I also hate that I can’t use my screen for more than 5 seconds without getting a warning to pay attention. Don’t really see the point of FSD if I basically have to sit like a statue and constantly nudge the steering wheel. How am I supposed to mess with my climate or music or navigation? Even if I look around to double check I’m not cutting someone off, I get a warning.

I'm biased, but I see new C3 footage, I post. TFLclassics has a very base spec early C3, which is an interesting car to look at. It only has a 327ci V8 rated at 300hp gross, mated to a 3-speed manual, which probably gives it acceleration figures comparable to the later gas crisis cars. That being said, definitely still a fun car to cruise around in, and the input points are very positive in these old C3s. Throttle response, shift-feel, steering, braking, etc. actually feel really good in good condition cars. It reminds me of my reaction the first time I used the brakes on my '80.

post,1kvcs9x,,TSLA vs. BYDDY – Which EV Stock Is the Better Bet Right Now?,"Let’s keep it real  Tesla’s got the hype, but BYD is quietly crushing it

Yeah, Tesla’s talking a big game with Full Self-Driving, robotaxis, and household robots. Cool stuff, but it's all *future*. Meanwhile, their core EV business? Slipping. Q1 deliveries were the worst in over two years (337k), and they’re losing global market share. Stock's riding on promises

Then there’s BYD. Not as flashy, but they’re dominating China 34% of the NEV market in 2024, $107B in revenue (more than Tesla!), and some insane charging tech (250 miles in 5 minutes?!). Plus, their cars are affordable. Under $10K for an EV? That’s game-changing

Sure, BYD isn’t as far along with FSD, but they’re investing $14B into making smarter cars. And the stock’s trading at a sane valuation (under 27x earnings). Tesla? Still moon-high

Hey folks, I need some help.  I have searched the Model 3 Service Manual, the EPC, Reddit, and ChatGPT for the name of the part in the picture.  I know the general term is brightwork, and there is plenty of documentation for the upper brightwork piece but not the piece indicated in the picture.

Why do I need to know?  I had an authorized Xpel t.i.n.t installer put t.i.n.t on my ‘21 Model 3, and when I got home I realized that the part in the picture was hitting/rubbing against the similar piece on the front of the LH back door.  It was not doing that prior to the install, so I want to be able to speak intelligently about the issue when I call them on Tuesday.  Not only that, I think it has to be in the Service Manual and/or EPC.

UWB is more accurate, shorter range, and more secure than Bluetooth. It also gave features such as auto boot (trunk) etc. 

Generally their app development teams tend to release updates for iOS before Android.

Another big one is Tesla is natively integrated with shortcuts on iOS so you can set up shortcuts and automations with Tesla from an iPhone, whilst I believe it’s only possible on Android via paid 3rd party apps where you not only have to pay monthly, but also trust the app enough to log into it with your Tesla account.

Next are v3 and v4 250kw Superchargers. These can charge non-Teslas if you have an adapter and Tesla's permission. Jeep does not right now.

The final class are v4 supercharger with an embedded adapter. Any EV can use these.

The final group is the only one that you can use.

The charging universe is not only Tesla. EVGo and electrify America have been on the scene for awhile. Lately I've been using Rivian Adventure Network chargers. Start with a tap of a credit card and super fast.

Just look for other chargers too is my advice. Use plugshare.com to search for chargers in the area where you are going.

post,1kw2152,,"Data after 50,000+ miles across a Bolt EUV and a Tesla Model 3","I have a separate meter for my 2023 Tesla Model 3 RWD that I use to track energy use, efficiency, cost (and cost-savings), etc., and compare back to very detailed data I kept on my previous ICE car. 

Given I've now driven >30,000 miles, it felt like a good time to share the data and because I had it, I also shared comparisons to the Bolt EUV. 

|Measure|2023 Tesla Model 3 RWD|2022 Bolt EUV FWD|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Miles**|30,499|19,912|
|**Total kWh**|9,028|6,547|
|**Wh/Mi; Mi/kWh; MPGe**|296; 3.38; 114|329; 3.04; 103|
|**Average Temp**|49F|52F|
|**Savings ; Tax**\*\*\*|$2,076.44; $437.37|$1,454.89; $279.50|

**SAVINGS**  
*\*I benchmarked the fuel costs associated against my prior car, a Toyota Corolla which got 33.17 mpg over the 100,000+ miles I tracked it, and I also benchmarked against current gas prices, which in my area have been roughly $3/gallon but I am using nuanced* [*monthly averages for my state*](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM_EPMRU_PTE_NUS_DPG&f=W)*. I also bake in a $30 oil change per 5,000 miles as ""fuel"".* 

*\*\*I also calculated the portion of my savings that is due to taxes I'm not paying at the pump (0.285+0.184 per gallon) - which is relevant politically given we can expect a $250/year EV surcharge to attempt to ""close that loophole"", which for me, looks to be ""fair"" if it were state + federal, but just being federal and* combine*d with my state's surcharge ($75), it is not.* 

I have insurance, tabs, depreciation, maintenance, as well but wanted to focus on ""fuel"". Those costs are all higher than the Corolla due to the Tesla (and Bolt) being much newer cars (and fully insured instead of minimally insured) and the heightened costs do offset the fuel-savings for now. I'll be curious to see over 100,000+ miles how the total cost to own tightens up and I expect the Tesla to win out.

I plan on getting a model s 2022LR this coming fall from Tesla or a local dealership and then eventually a model x and I am by no means a speed performance guy or really care about the looks of the rims. That’s why Idgaf about the plaid trims

Trying to find some rims and wheels not breaking the bank/or atleast are reasonably priced but provide the best efficiency but also provide the rim protection or at least overlap to help prevent cracking the rim or road rash. Pros and cons to the sizing of wheels are appreciated too, but I’d imaging I’m pretty onset for 19” for the model s. 

(I’ll go to a model x refresh once it drops down to high 30’s/low 40’s hopefully) 
With this it’ll be my daily driver, but once we move this model s will go to my fiancée and she is sometimes a curb monster and I don’t want to have to worry about it. 

Anyone got any recommendations? 
Model s and x references are appreciated!

But the type of tire doesn't matter for your purposes, I'd recommend looking for a Model S that comes with the 19"" wheels, those wheels a) have plastic covers that actually go over the wheels, they're easily replaceable so no need to worry about curb rash and b) have lots of affordable tires that can be slightly oversized from the factory tires.  Example, the 19s are OEM size 255/45/19 in the front. When I bought my car I got winter tires that were sized 265/45/19 (fronts), this was a little wider and gave PLENTY of protection of the rim.

All in all, if I were you, I just would stick with the factory wheels, put aside ~$500 for wheel rash repair, and stick with factory tire sizes.

post,1kwjdmm,,TSLA: Why I'm still bullish despite the EPS nosedive,"Been holding TSLA since 2021 and just watched their recent earnings with mixed feelings. While everyone's freaking out about the 53% EPS drop, I've been trying to make sense of why the stock is still up 37% over the same period. Either I'm missing something or the market is.

My position: 120 shares @ $187 average (up about 81% total)

The Q1 earnings were objectively bad

EPS of $0.27 vs expected $0.41 (missed by 34%)

Factory changeovers for Model Y killed production numbers

Automotive margins down to 19% from previous highs in the mid-20s

Musk sounding increasingly distracted on the call

Yet I'm still holding and even added 15 shares on the post-earnings dip. Here's why:

The energy business is quietly becoming a monster

While everyone obsesses over car deliveries, Tesla's energy storage business hit record gross profit with 26% margins. My brother works in commercial solar, and he says Megapack orders are backlogged for months. The margins here are substantially better than automotive, and it's growing faster.

The robotaxi bet could pay off big

I was skeptical about the robotaxi timeline until I saw the Austin test videos. If they actually launch paid rides next month as planned, it changes everything about the valuation model. Even if it's limited geographically, proving the technology works would be massive.

Optimus robot could be the sleeper hit

comment,1kwi8a9,1kwi8a9,,"There's really no way out of this mess for Tesla.

It's not like Musk was always running on all cylinders, and while he didn't lose all his marbles initially, there was certainly a hole in the bag. 

By coupling their brand with Elon they've brought this on themselves. Even if they remove him as CEO, people will still associate him with the company, and the hate in Europe is personal. Nobody likes Nazis there, so Musk, Vance and others are not very well liked.

People dislike Elon, and because he is CEO of Tesla, \*\*and\*\* owns Tesla stock, people won't buy Teslas. Because nobody buys them, resale value has also tanked, meaning people are even more reluctant to purchase one.

Removing Elon and buying him out might be the only solution, and follow up with a massive marketing campaign informing people of just that, and still knowing full well that he can tank them again any time he likes by just buying stock. 

The stain on Elon isn't going away anytime soon. It took the better part of 80 years for people to ""forgive and forget"" the Nazis from WW2.

post,1kwrt8l,,New 3-row EV comparison,"Below is the summary by Google NotebookLM

* **Kia EV9**
   * **Price:** Starts at $54,900, or basically $55,000, making it the cheapest and best value vehicle in the three-row segment. The as-tested price of the specific model shown was just over $70,000, around $72,000. You can get the Land trim with a large battery pack and dual motor for this price. Leasing is also mentioned as very cheap, around $299 per month with about $2500 down (taxes included in Colorado).
   * **Range:** The video mentions the EPA rated range is put up. The large battery pack is almost 100 kilowatt hours. The range is described as ""not all that much,"" just under 100 kilowatt hours, but considered an ""easy justification"" for the price.
   * **Charging Performance:** Charging performance is noted as being good due to its EGMP platform. The peak charging speed is about 220 kW briefly, but most of the time it's about 200 kW, and it holds this speed deep into the pack, sitting at just about 200 kW up to 80%. This makes it an amazing charging vehicle for road trips. However, it's the only vehicle in the comparison that doesn't natively interface well with the Tesla Supercharger network, getting a maximum of 84 kW currently, though this is expected to increase to 125 kW for model year 2026. It uses an onboard booster for Supercharging and can be buggy.
* **Cadillac Vistic**
   * **Price:** Described as ""quite a bit more money than the Kia,"" starting around $80,000 base, with the as-tested model around $84,000. Higher trims can go up to $100,000.
   * **Range:** Shares the Lyric battery, which GM quotes as 102 kilowatt hours capacity, though it's closer to 105-106 kWh.

I originally ordered a 2026 Model Y with AWD, then later changed my configuration to the RWD version after it was released. My account reflects the updated pricing and specs for RWD.

However, I was recently assigned a vehicle that (based on public lookup tools) may correspond to an AWD build. I’m wondering if this has happened to anyone else — maybe during a config change or transition period?

Did the issue eventually get corrected? Or did you receive the different drivetrain?

Appreciate any insight!

Have insurance companies, contrarian bets, mix of mid cap growth companies which have proven themselves with continuously strong earnings reports, and few crazy growth stories.

**The Rules**: DCA daily, when fear and greed index dumps below 25 then aggressively DCA even lump sum. If a company has more than 2 bad earnings more-so guidance than they're out.

**Good Time To Buy?**: I believe they're all overpriced right now. Will hedge with UVXY calls buying monthlies, selling against the position creating diagonals at various strikes when there's an upcoming binary event which could be negative catalyst.

comment,1kwulr6,1kwulr6,,"People are giving you incomplete answers here.

What you noticed probably isn't magic or a placebo.

On Teslas, if the alignment data is reset in the service menu, the car ""forgets"" where the center point of the alignment ""actually physically is"", and sets back to 0 degrees relative to the steering column. Over the next 5, 10, 20, 50 miles, the car keeps track of the position of the steering wheel when the car is driving straight and applies an offset to the value, which adjusts where the car sees it's home/base steering position value. This affects the pull of the steering wheel. This is so that if the steering wheel is off by 1 or 2 degrees, the car won't forever ""pull"" to straighten the wheel out. It'll learn exactly what position the steering wheel must be in for the car to go perfectly straight, and will pull toward that position.

Let's say your tesla had a learned steering offset of -2 degrees. You might not even realize. Car drives perfectly straight with no pull left or right. Then you hit a pothole and bend something or mess something up, and now the ""real center point"" of the steering in order to go down the road straight is more like PLUS 2 degrees instead of minus 2 degrees. The steering wheel is going to be pulling to one side when you let go of the wheel. If somebody went in and RESET that learned steering offset value, now it's back to ""0"" and the steering wheel is going to be pulling to that side HALF as badly.",2459,True,1748371059.0,2025-05-27 20:37:39,22,0,Douche_Baguette,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kwulr6/could_my_tesla_have_fixed_its_own_alignment/muk8kje/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,muk8kje

post,1kwx3a7,,Headrest Question,"
Hi everyone,

I noticed yesterday that my passenger headrest in my 2021 Model Y. From my research, this appears to be a common issue.

I sent in a service request and received an invoice for $205. Looking on third-party sites, I can find OEM headrests for ~$50 and can easily replace it myself. However, this OEM number is 1623801-00-A. The OEM part for the headrest that Tesla quoted me was 1623798-91-C.

Again doing research, I cannot find much difference between these OEM parts. Both appear to fit my 2021 MY. It appears the Tesla quoted OEM would include abilities for “special features”? I am not sure what special features would be included in my headrest. 

Would anyone be able to guide me in the right direction here?",729,False,1748375823.0,2025-05-27 21:57:03,1,7,ImmediateMajor4337,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwx3a7,False,0.6,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kx07eb,,FSD AI halucinating / lying just like regular AI?," I have an exit I prefer to use that is one prior to the direct exit due to that street having lots of pot holes and construction. I have tried and can not permanently edit the route.  When I am on the freeway maybe 10 miles out I will edit the route and select the other route with the exit prior.  Often when I hit accept the map refreshes and then reverts to the original exit so that I have to click the change again.

Since the last update it will accept the change right away and reflect it on the map and also in the turn by turn direction.  The car will start moving to the exit lane and then pass the exit and take the one it wanted in the first place. This morning it passed the exit again and then turned on the signal and wanted to take the emergency lane on the overpass thinking it could still get off.

It will also do this when I get home.  I re-route, it accepts and confirms and I can see the change on the map then it will wait too long to merge and take the next street anyways (the street it initally said it would take)

  
I get the feeling they system will do what I want after asking a few times just to shut me up (such as putting on the signal multiple times before it decides to change lanes) and then just does what it originally wanted anyways.

Now I do notice that I have the cameras active 90% of the drive and once I get to this part of the freeway I have been loosing my cabin camera monitoring and get the streeting wheel nag.  I also sometimes get a buffer on my apple music. I am wondering if this is due to a lack of connectivity in the area?

post,1kx0z93,,Exploring FSD is fun!,"Carrying in on my exploration of the latest FSD release, we got a call from Applebee’s.  My wife left her phone at the restaurant.  I immediately volunteered to retrieve the pink princess phone. My motives weren’t pure of course, I just wanted an excuse to try out FSD again.  I’m sure my OCD ‘drove’ me to this.  From the garage I launched FSD with the parking option.  Maggie (my model Y’s name ‘cause her license plate starts with MGY) obediently backed up, did a 3 corner turn and moved onto the road.  She navigated the entire 4 miles on local roads without fuss including a bridge out (common here in Pennsylvania) and not only got me into Applebees parking lot but pulled straight in to a parking spot.  That flustered me because I thought for sure she’d back in.  Oh well.  I retrieved the errant iPhone and started the voyage back home with FSD from the parking spot.  As I approached a critical intersection that normally goes straight she indicated a turn.  I thought “that’s not right” and overrode and went straight.  Shortly after that I got stuck in a 1/2 mile backup on a two lane road.  After 10 minutes of listening to Audible I decided to turn around and try another path home.  As soon as I made the U-turn I turned over driving to Maggie.  Soon I was back on track (I waved to others stuck in the jam whilst driving to make their own getaway) and Maggie did her magic.  I was back on track enjoying the Audible book (Bobiverse book 3).  From that point on she got me home through a couple more nasties and, yay, she turned into our driveway right up to the house.  Not quite pulling into the garage but close enough.  Damn, I’m REALLY loving this!  Let me know if I’m being way over the top with this experience or if you want me to post more like this.

post,1kx17ua,,Seat position discrepancy between 2026 and 2021(or older versions) Model Y - Anyone else noticing this?,"I recently upgraded from a 2021 Model Y to a 2026 Model Y, and I've noticed something odd when syncing my profile between the two vehicles. When I save my seat position in the 2026 Model Y and then use the same profile in my 2021 Model Y, the seat position in the older model ends up much farther back (the recline) than it is in the new model. 
Has anyone else who has upgraded to a 2026 Model Y while keeping their older Model Y experienced this? I'm wondering if it's due to differences in the seat design or the reclining mechanism between the two. The steering wheel position seems to sync just fine, but the seat position, particularly the recline, feels off way off, this is vice versa because if I change the position in the 2021 it's much closer position to the steering wheel in the 2026.

Doesn’t mean I won’t criticize him, but I do so on things that are real not hoax-based.

He’s definitely been showing his ass a lot more within the past year.  His shilling for Musk and Trump is pathetic.  He’s proven many times over the years he knows better, so the current views are an appeal to cult populism.

The biggest lie abiut him is regarding his returns.  On Wall Street, his performance was legitimately excellent.  He averaged something like 24-27% *after* fees, for over 15 years.  That doesn’t happen by luck.  His major calls since retiring would have made you an 8 figure millionaire.  That’s possibly why he spews such overconfidence in things like TSLA and AAPL.  Put simply, they’ve been major multi-bagger successful stories for him, so from his perspective, why not?

He’s a genius in multiple subject areas which is probably what made him a narcissist.  One such area is market whispering, and that has helped his results through some legendary “sell all” calls in which he’s kept his portfolios from getting whacked down to the average.  

He’s made many big and powerful enemies, and they’re the source of 98% of the criticism you’ve absorbed.

post,1kx4kb9,,Model 3 HW4 FSD Software Crashes and AP Critical Alerts. Any experience or advice?,"I wanted to get some input from you guys related to an issue I've been having with my 2024 Model 3 to see if anyone else has experienced my issue and if so, what did Tesla do to resolve it:

  
Over the past several months, I've had an intermittent issue where I'll be using FSD and the car will start alarming and saying to take over immediately followed by ""Autopilot aborted due to system error"". It then takes 5 or so minutes for it to come back online. At first, I brushed it off as a bug in the software, but it became more frequent and recently went as far as braking to a stop and putting itself in park in the middle of a highway.

  
What's odd is that after it does its reboot, there are no lingering user facing errors or notifications to get the vehicle serviced. In service mode the main alert showing up is APS\_w159\_apbCritical which states ""*Autopilot Processor Secondary (APS) detects that the Autopilot Processor Backup (APB) is not functioning as expected, making Autopilot (AP) features unavailable.""* 

  
I've already made a service appointment, but the Tesla service technician seemed to be dismissive of there being a real problem and scheduled me pretty far out. My concern is that this seems to keep happening on multiple software versions and does not seem to be a common error other drivers are reporting. The most info I can find seems to revolve around the 2024 holiday update bricking model 3s built in the same month mine was, but I had no issue with the update and my car does not completely loose FSD/AP after rebooting like other cars did.

  
If anyone can give any anecdotal experience with a similar issue and/or advice on handling the service appointment, I'd greatly appreciate it!",1723,False,1748395389.0,2025-05-28 03:23:09,1,3,Isotopicgoose,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kx4kb9/model_3_hw4_fsd_software_crashes_and_ap_critical/,True,0.6,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

At my last visit, on Friday, roof was replaced bc it was 6mm off (specs are 1-1.5, so 6 is way off) but now it whistles like an open window. I am at my wit’s end with this car. There is no joy. Just frustration and resentment every time I look at it. Service manager offered me credits or to initiate a buy back, but said the buy back determination is out of his hands. Would love to hear if anyone has been successful with these.

* Yes, the warranty still applies for used through 3rd party. I purchased a used 2023 through the tesla site and received an additional warranty.
* I had to rotate the tires but they were in good shape for 21k miles. I recommend low mileage if it’s in your budget. Long range used tend to have lots of miles. I wanted one but the standard range is doing just fine. I also had to change the filters. The car needs new wipers. That’s it for maintenance. My car had a crack in the sunroof that I missed during delivery. Fortunately Tesla replaced it free.
* I had FSD free for 30 days loved it. It comes with a subscription for all Tesla’s at $99/month plus tax. You can purchase through the car or app. You may also wantbto subscribe to the premium connectivity for internet service it was cheaper to subscribe to a one year term for like $100.
* Do a thorough walk through. Make a list or find one online.
* If this is your first EV consider the costs for charger installation Nema or wall charger. Will the car come with a mobile charger? Mine did not so I paid like $300 for mobile and $515 for wall charger plus install.
* Try to get the $4k tax credit if you can. Tesla offers it at point of sale and so does Carvana.

This is my first EV and during my research 90% of Tesla owners recommended percentage (seems to be consistent with the comments here). That’s what I’m using however it did take some getting used to. 

*Tip: while learning your vehicle, take it on a trip and see how the percentage/mileage changes as you accelerate. Be sure to use GPS. Then try to get to a steady speed and see how consistent it becomes. The percentage/mileage for your trip will become more accurate and you will know that the change/accuracy for the GPS is in your control. Not much different than any other car. Higher RPM’s means you’re buring more gas/mile. The Tesla doesn’t exactly have this gauge, at least not in my model 3.

comment,1kx5c3a,1kx5c3a,,">""In China, we see intense competition and Tesla is no longer seen as the technology leader.""

I think this is the real kicker here. 

While the sales decline worldwide (especially in the US) has *some* to do with Elon's salute and his time at Doge,  I think other factors have contributed much more to it. Tesla's sales have been shrinking for the past two years.

A very limited and aging lineup, 3/5 of which are out of the reach of the average person has played a big role. More people want SUVs over sedans, so Tesla is effectively competing with just one model. I don't think the refresh was significant enough for people to want to upgrade.

I too believe that nobody thinks of them as the technology leader anymore which is why the competition has been able to gain a foothold. 

Their tech is still better than the competition in North America in the sense that everything just works and works seamlessly, lag free, but I don't think that's gonna cut it anymore. Model Y is still the highest selling EV in most places but I doubt it'll be for long.",1057,False,1748402118.0,2025-05-28 05:15:18,30,0,ChickenFlavoredCake,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kx5c3a/byd_xiaomi_overtake_tesla_as_top_ev_brand_choices/mumxrsr/,True,,2025,both,hot,False,False,0,mumxrsr

3. Car has to be only one previous owner. (Ask the dealer for the carmax report...it will tell you if it is only 1-owner or not)
4. The model of the used EV must be 2 years or more older than the current model out.
5. Also must be from a dealer, not a personal sale (not 100% sure on this part)...because the dealer has to register with the IRS in order to give you credit for the used EV.   As a matter of fact, when I bought it, the dealer did the paperwork for me, sent it in and gave me the credit in about 2 weeks and released the car to me.

This is what’s so frustrating. Other car brands have had 10 years to put together a product with an experience like Tesla and they just can’t (or won’t) do it. 

I want an EV that has a big ass screen, has an excellent app with tons of features, works totally lag free, has all of the little niceties Tesla has (no key, automatic start, seats move into position for me, automatic lock when I walk away), has great range and charge speed, *and* starts around $40,000.

comment,1kx7cn7,1kx7cn7,,"In fact, it is true. As an embedded engineer in China, I have always use chips from ST and Ambarella in the past because they have better performance, are cheaper, and have better documentation (which is the most important thing for me because it makes my develop easier).

Although the government encouraged us to use domestic suppliers before, no one in our company paid attention to those bureaucrats. We just purchased some and did some test development, mainly as a technical reserve, and received very little tax subsidies (basically just enough to pay our wages for test development). We will not use it on our products because it will make us not that competitive in the market.



Until Trump came, we had to accept Chinese suppliers (and shitty documents, which greatly increased the difficulty of my development). But from 2019 to now, because of the surge in demand for domestic suppliers, I found that the quality of Chinese chips has begun to get better and better, and the documents have also changed from shitty level at the beginning to piss-level now. I thought this kind of progress would never happen, because from 2012 to 2020, the government continued to subsidize the IC industry, but there are always only scammers in this industry. But in the end, the real demand in the market drove the real progress of China's IC industry, which is more important than any subsidy.

post,1kxf90a,,Suggestion: enable/disable accessory power via App/API,"I love that we can now enable/disable accessory power through the vehicle. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like this is possible via the [vehicle commands API](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/vehicle-commands#charge-max-range) or through the Tesla App itself. My use case: I have a battery-powered (independent of the vehicle HV/LV batteries) Dashcam that charges via the onboard 12V when I'm driving the car. 



Unfortunately, during long absences between driving / very short drives, I'm not able to charge the battery enough to get a reliable 12 - 14 hours of standby recording. I could leave the setting on permanently but this is wasteful and results in significantly higher idle-power usage. 



Ideally, I'd like a setting where I could have 12V power for 1-2 hours (enough to charge the battery, and then shutoff). Rivian has a feature like this and I've found it super helpful. It would also be cool to enable this as an API command and then use Tessie to trigger automations.



Why do I use an external dashcam? The optical quality of Blackvue dashcams is superior to Tesla's cameras and this has allowed me to capture license plate details where Tesla's built-in cameras have failed. I also like the fact that the front lens features a 136 degree wide horizontal capture angle, which allows me to get more of the road. I use a battery so that the dashcam can record even when the vehicle is off.",1428,False,1748433637.0,2025-05-28 14:00:37,4,3,JamMydar,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kxf90a/suggestion_enabledisable_accessory_power_via/,True,0.84,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

We went on multiple road trips and I was just utterly amazed that I didn't have to touch the wheel or pedals no matter if we were on city, windy country, highway, or neighborhood roads. Parked and parallel parked itself. Could summon it over to us. I'm blown away!

However, I saw that the government is looking to get rid of the $7,500 tax credit. If the bill passes, when might be the last we can use it on a new Tesla?

The bottom half of Nova Scotia, Cape Breton Island and the entirety of Newfoundland do not have superchargers. 

It looks like there are some other networks in those areas via Flo and others like it but, I’m not sure how reliable and realistic it is for me to easily get to a charger, be there a reasonable amount of time and head off on the next adventure.  Also unclear about level two chargers. I have a ccs combo 1 adapter but have had experiences where it just won’t work or stay connected to some stations. 

Any tips or experiences you all could share?  

Also am confused about the charge rates for New Brunswick and PEI. Example of a PEI station of 0-60 kWh at $0.44, 60-100kwh at $0.89, 100-180 kWh at $1.39 and 180-250 kWh at $2.33

1. Price. The higher trims hit mid $70K and there are just fewer customers in this segment (irrespective of brand, range etc). 
2. Range. For a car starting mid $60Ks, a range of 230 miles is just not acceptable. It’s off by a 100 miles actually. 
3. No incentives. Since this isn’t made in the U.S. Also no special lease deals in the U.S.  
4. Minivans are just not popular, especially compared to SUVs. Doesn’t matter how novel it looks. 
5. Marketing. Unfortunately, there is almost no effective marketing campaigns to promote the vehicle.

Upon checking the auto report the car is build and sold in sep 2020 without the wireless charhing, heat pump and other 2021 features, I felt betrayed and asked about it and they said it's standard procedure across the Industry, year doesn't mean you get the features - I was like but it says 2021 and I thought it will have the features, they said again ""as per order agreement""

Now I escalated this to used car manager and he says he put a mail to director is what he claims atleast and says got response from director and as per order agreement no refund no transfer if you don't take delivery it will be canceled. I said that is not fair please listen to call logs I gave them date and time too, again ""as per order agreement....

Now I do not know what to do
some friends suggest file bbb complaint or raise a dispute but I want to get a tesla and I will buy a tesla if not this car, so I do not want to be flagged from tesla for the bbb complaint or a chargeback

What option do I have now?
Is there anyway to get my $500 back?

For people who want to see the details, subsection 112002(a) of the bill says:

        (a) In General.--Section 30D is amended--
                (1) by redesignating subsection (h) as subsection (i), and
                (2) in subsection (i), as so redesignated, by striking 
            ``December 31, 2032'' and inserting ``December 31, 2026''

This changes [26 USC Section 30D(h)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&edition=prelim&req=granuleid%3AUSC-2010-title26-section30D&num=0) to read:

>~~(h)~~ **(i)** Termination

>No credit shall be allowed under this section with respect to any vehicle placed in service after ~~December 31, 2032~~ **December 31, 2026**.

The next subsection of the bill goes on to say that for vehicles placed in service during 2026, there is a 200,000 vehicle cap. So, for Tesla, the substantive language can effectively be summarized as: ""No credit shall be allowed under this section with respect to any Tesla vehicle placed in service after December 31, 2025.""

We can then read [26 CFR Section 1.30D-2(b)(36)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-26/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-1/subject-group-ECFRcb39f040b41b74b/section-1.30D-2) for what ""placed in service"" means:

post,1kxrc5b,,"Leno's Law [35 year smog exemption in CA] has passed a major hurdle, but lost some of its teeth.","Around a month ago the 35 year smog exemption was placed in suspense while the appropriations committee spent more time on it. On Friday it successfully made it out of the appropriations committee, and should (hopefully) get a full vote by the CA senate.

But in the appropriations committee they made some modifications that make it somewhat less useful. The important part of the current amended text now reads:

***(c)  For purposes of subdivision (a), a collector motor vehicle, as defined in Section 259 of the Vehicle Code, is exempt from those portions of the test required by subdivision (f) of Section 44012 if the collector motor vehicle meets all of the following criteria:***

* ***(1) Submission of proof that the motor vehicle is insured as a collector motor vehicle, as shall be required by regulation of the bureau.***
* ***(2) The motor vehicle is at least 35 model years old.***
* ***(3) The motor vehicle complies with the exhaust emissions standards for that motor vehicle’s class and model year as prescribed by the department, and the motor vehicle passes a functional inspection of the fuel cap and a visual inspection for liquid fuel leaks.***

Both (1) and (3) represent a significant modification from the previous text. It looks like you'll have to submit some paperwork to do.

(3) Makes it unclear to me what actual benefit this bill will have if it gets passed. This gives the department (DMV) significant leeway to prescribe emissions standards that could really moot the whole point of the bill. We may not have a good idea what those will be until this is actually implemented, but I'm not overwhelmingly hopeful given the history of this kind of thing.

If you take the 20k foundation badging and things out of it i haven’t seen any beasts but the AWD is going for 75k used in a few postings near me with about 10k in accessories thrown in so maybe 65k vs 80k new. It’s not bad but it is more streamlined with average price drop off for new vehicles. 

My take is in a few years the moron flock will be on to something else, the cybertruck was never intended to run beyond a few years as it was more a proof of concept in a lot of manufacturing and electrical technologies that Tesla has patented. It is a cool collectors item to the history of the brand and cars in general so we will see prices start to flatten out. Then maybe a few years after that you will be getting full face value for a foundation series at least. Even if it’s someone who just wants to garage it or museum it in private collections.

post,1kxsby5,,"Tesla targets June 12 launch for robotaxi service in Austin, Bloomberg News reports","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-targets-june-12-launch-204524186.html

(Reuters) -Tesla is poised to begin its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin on June 12, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The date has been discussed internally and could still change, the report added.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Earlier this month, CEO Elon Musk said the EV maker is set to begin a test of its long-promised robotaxi service on schedule in Austin, Texas, by the end of June.

A successful robotaxi trial is crucial for Tesla as Musk has shifted the company's focus away from building a new, cheaper EV platform to launching the robotaxi service and its Optimus humanoid robots. Much of Tesla's valuation hangs on that bet.

Tesla sales have fallen worldwide with rising competition and as Musk faces a backlash for his political views and his role as an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump.

I just picked up a 2025 Model 3 Performance and I’m looking into getting a spare tire setup. I know these don’t come with one, and I’m not super comfortable relying only on the repair foam kit.

I’m fine with buying a full-size aftermarket wheel if needed. (I’ve heard 19"" wheels can work) but I want to make sure whatever I get fits properly, especially with the Performance model’s larger brakes.

Also, I’ve seen a few posts mention something about a locator bolt or retention bolt that might need to be removed for certain aftermarket wheels or spare tires to fit. Can anyone confirm that or explain what I’d need to do?

post,1kxu7oq,,First-Time EV Buyer's Guide,"I often help people on the weekly General Questions and Purchasing Advice thread, and have been thinking about doing something like this to compile my answers to common questions. I'm going to structure it like a guide for each part of the buying process, but it's more like a collection of my thoughts. I'd be happy to add to it if anyone has anything else to contribute! This is also US-centric (sorry). 

#The Starting Line
So you want to buy an EV eh? Awesome! The process is, in general, very similar to buying a standard internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, but with a few key additional areas of research. I'm going to assume you generally know the basics of ICE vehicle ownership, and make this guide as specific as possible the electric portion of the vehicle purchasing. 

# Assess your situation
As always you should buy a car that suits your needs. Trucks for construction work, vans for families, etc. EVs are no different, but you should ask yourself a few additional questions to determine which, if any, EV is right for you: 

* The first, most important question - do you have a place to charge? The main benefit EV owners cite is that the vehicle can ""refuel"" at home, every night. In contrast, the ""worst"" part of the experience is public charging. Even for Superchargers, which are widely considered the most reliable and easiest to use network, charging takes longer than refueling with gas and almost always eliminates any cost savings from getting rid of gas. It's less common, but you can 100% get by if you charge at work or a public area like a shopping center you regularly visit. 
* What's your normal daily mileage? How much battery do you need? Almost all full battery-powered EVs (BEVs) have >200 miles of range at this point.",12114,True,1748470421.0,2025-05-29 00:13:41,68,33,chilidoggo,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kxu7oq/firsttime_ev_buyers_guide/,True,0.95,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kxwjdj,,Tesla investors demand Musk work 40-hour week at EV maker as ‘crisis’ builds,"Elon Musk needs to spend more time at Tesla as his electric vehicle company faces a “crisis,” according to a letter on Wednesday from a group of pension fund leaders who manage investments in the company.

“Tesla’s stock price volatility, declining sales, as well as disconcerting reports regarding the company’s human rights practices, and a plummeting global reputation are cause for serious concern,” the investors wrote in a letter to Robyn Denholm, the company’s board chair. “Moreover, many issues are linked to Mr. Musk’s actions outside of his role as Technoking and Chief Executive Officer at Tesla, including his high-profile role as an architect of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).”

The investors want the Tesla board to require Musk to work a minimum of 40 hours per week at the automaker as a condition of any new compensation plan they may arrange for him. They also want a clear succession plan for management of the EV business, and a policy that would apply to all Tesla directors limiting their outside board commitments at public and private companies.

Early last year, the Delaware Court of Chancery ordered Tesla to rescind Musk’s 2018 CEO pay package, which had been worth around $56 billion, finding that Musk controlled the company, and the board’s compensation committee misled shareholders before seeking their vote to approve the plan.

Musk now says he wants even more shares, amounting to 25% voting control of the company.

Tesla’s brand value and reputation have declined since 2024, due largely to Musk’s incendiary rhetoric and political activities. In addition to pouring nearly $300 million into an effort to get Donald Trump back into the White House, Musk formally endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party ahead of the country’s parliamentary election this year.

At DOGE, Musk has led an initiative by the Trump administration to slash federal agencies.",3951,True,1748476658.0,2025-05-29 01:57:38,151,36,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kxwjdj/tesla_investors_demand_musk_work_40hour_week_at/,True,0.92,2025,both,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kxyf5a,,Model 3 - near disaster with 3 inch hail during update.,"I was waiting for my son to come home with the Model 3 we purchases yesterday. As soon as he got in the door, our phones went crazy. The NWS warned of 3 inch hail being immanent.  Ok, get Tesla into garage. Nope, my son started a software update when he got home.  It would not start, would not go into neutral. We googled for way to do it, but nothing. We saw a post talking about if it said downloading in app we can disconnect wifi.  That did the trick and we were able to drive it in. Of course, the hail missed us.  It is not prompting for the update anymore. We got 2025.14.7.

comment,1kxxgm4,1kxxgm4,,"Let me get this straight:

* Your dad:
   * Intends to buy a used Tesla, 
   * Qualifies for the used EV tax credit,  
   * Wants to get the used EV tax credit, and
   * Does not qualify to get a loan to buy a Tesla.
* You and your brother:
   * Intend to put your names on the loan so your dad can get the loan and 
   * Do not qualify for the used EV tax credit.

Your question is, ""Will putting your name and your brother's name on the loan and (I presume) any title documents cause any problems with your dad getting the tax credit?"" 

Answer: probably not.  

As far as the IRS is concerned, it seems as though only the person the dealer reports to the IRS as the buyer needs to qualify for the used tax credit.  The IRS doesn't exactly say this, but here are the clues:

In [IRS FS-2024-26, page 4, A11](https://www.irs.gov/pub/taxpros/fs-2024-26.pdf#page=4), the IRS mentioned multiple people getting the *new* EV tax credit:

>The name and taxpayer identification number of the owner claiming the New Clean Vehicle Credit should be listed on the seller’s report. See Topic B, FAQ 9. Accordingly, multiple owners of a new clean vehicle should inform the seller which owner will claim the New Clean Vehicle Credit so that the seller can identify that taxpayer on the seller’s report. **The credit would be allowed only on the tax return of the owner listed in the seller’s report.",3559,True,1748482402.0,2025-05-29 03:33:22,1,0,SirMontego,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kxxgm4/cosign_on_used_ev_credit/mut2xr0/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mut2xr0

comment,1kxu7oq,1kxu7oq,,"> Another consideration is to buy used but then we’d lose out on $11k in state+federal incentives. We make too much for the 4k used car rebate

EV sellers are generally aware of this and will price it into the used car price. This is one of the reasons why new EVs depreciate so hard in value (on top of the typical factors and the fact that EVs are improving so fast, each new model year has substantial improvements).

> Downside of used is it would have older tech which could impact charging, range, driver assistance features 

For the Ioniq 5, the 2023 or later will be fine, you'll just need an adapter for supercharger access. The original owner might already have it otherwise it'll run you around $300. You do want the adapter if you do any amount of road tripping - supercharger access + access to CCS is largely what has ""solved"" charger coverage in the last year.

> Some info about me: We drive about 15k miles a year, gas is approx $3.50/gal, and electricity costs $0.12/kwh. Civic is in good shape but I’d assume we’d need to replace it in the next 5-10 with our current usage. We live in the mountains so AWD is a priority.

**Additional Notes**:

I’m driving in Ann Arbor for at least a year, likely two. After that, I’ll either sell or bring the car to NYC — where street parking and crime make a nice car a risk.

# Option 1: Used Tesla Model 3 (2020+, ~$20–25K)

* Pros: Dream car, $4K EV tax credit, tech, fun to drive, could be worth it for 2 years of joy
* Cons: Battery degradation unknown, no home charger (would supercharge every 2 weeks), depreciation, might be overkill if I sell in 2 years or bring it to NYC

# Option 2:  Used Mazda CX-5 (2017+, ~$17-20K)

* Pros: Stylish, reliable, gas is simpler than charging, more peace of mind than Tesla, good resale
* Cons: Still relatively pricey, not EV, higher fuel and maintenance costs than Tesla

# Option 3: 2015 Chevy Cruze (~$4K friend selling for cheap)

* Pros: Cheap, minimal financial risk, but scared of big repair, great for short-term use, low insurance
* Cons: High mileage (\~122K), worried about surprise repair costs, might not enjoy driving...",1729,True,1748502623.0,2025-05-29 09:10:23,1,0,RandomFish1234,cars,https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1kvtshb/what_car_should_i_buy_a_weekly_megathread/muud305/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,muud305

AND. It has to do both, not just an evap system.

That's how it works now. I can register my 30 year old federal emissions vehicle in California because it meets the standard it had to. The only snaffoo is when my cat fails I can't replace it with another federal cat, I must buy the expensive California cat. 

Concession #3 isn't a distinction I give a fuck about, it's expensive or expensiver. So everyone will still register it in Montana because you still have to maintain an expensive emissions system.

post,1ky8r5u,,NY Times: Export Controls Are Endangering the Fragile U.S.-China Truce,"Just two-and-a-half weeks after agreeing to suspend tariffs, both countries are using export controls to disrupt each other’s key industries.

After stepping back this month from an escalating and dangerous war of tariffs, the United States and China are now threatening to undermine their uneasy truce.

On May 12, the countries announced after weekend meetings in Geneva that they would suspend most of their recently imposed tariffs. Since then, however, both governments have shown that they are still prepared to wield controls over critical exports as weapons against one another, with moves that are potentially even more damaging to trade and global supply chains.

China has restricted its exports of rare earth magnets, which are crucial for cars, semiconductors, aircraft and many other applications. Close to 90 percent of the world’s rare earth metals, including magnets, are produced in China.

And the United States on May 13 banned the latest semiconductors from Huawei, a Chinese electronics giant. Then on Wednesday, President Trump suspended the shipment of American semiconductors and some aerospace equipment needed for China’s commercial aircraft, the C919, a signature project in China’s push toward economic self-reliance.

The increasing use of export controls by both countries amounts to supply chain warfare, interrupting the flow of key components that the other country must have to operate huge industries that employ large numbers of workers.

Last week, Ford Motor temporarily closed a factory in Chicago that makes Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles after one of its suppliers ran out of the magnets. In most new cars, the magnets are used in dozens of electric motors that operate brake and steering systems, fuel injectors and even power seats.

post,1kyaiiu,,(05/29) Tariffs and Teslas and Takeovers!,"NVDA is the most interesting stock today.

Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

The court stated they lacked a valid national emergency justification and infringed upon congressional powers. We saw a huge move in the market afterhours yesterday, mainly interested to see if we can continue the move. Is the tariff madness over? Absolutely not, but I'm interested in seeing if we keep momentum upwards. 

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\-NVDA reported Q1 revenue of $44.1B, with data center revenue at $39.1B vs $39.3B exp. The company said that guidance would have been $8B higher except for lost sales from the China restriction on H20 chips. I was mainly interested in the $140 level yesterday and we blew past that afterhours yesterday. Overall, great earnings report with further hopes that China restriction is lifted.

> As of the past week since being out of debt, I’ve invested in a couple Quantum Computing stocks, Tesla, and two cryptos. Is this a good strategy, if not, what would be your strategy be and why?

First step, as more of a /r/personalfinance topic, would be to build up some emergency savings. Something you can rely on if you lose your job or have some unexpected major expense. There are various rules of thumbs on this, but think like, several months worth of essential expenses.

> I am now looking to invest around $400-600 a week for the next 3 years, hard. I will obviously continue but I have a goal of hitting 100k at-least, within the 3 year mark.

If you save $600 a week, every week, for 3 years straight, you will be really close to $100k just on contributions alone.

How much risk are you willing to have with your hard-earned $100k? That's the question you have to ask yourself. Would you be okay with seeing it cut in half, down to $50k, at the 3-year mark? That's the risk of being all in stocks.

If the goal is to have $100k for sure in 3 years, your best bet is probably a high-yield savings account and just hit that $600-ish per week number consistently. 

If you really do want to be invested in stocks, I'd just stick with some sort of index. Crypto, Tesla, and some quantum computing stuff... that's a ""yikes"" from me.",1375,False,1748525434.0,2025-05-29 15:30:34,2,0,therealjerseytom,investing,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kya9pj/out_of_debt_a_week_ago_looking_to_invest_now/muvpgv2/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,muvpgv2
