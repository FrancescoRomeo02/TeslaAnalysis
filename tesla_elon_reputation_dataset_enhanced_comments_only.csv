As this link references, in her biography *Tesla: Man Out of Time*, Margaret Cheney claimed Tesla was antisemitic saying he made an antisemitic comment to a secretary once. There doesn't appear to be any corroborating evidence of Tesla having any prejudice against Jewish people though with the small exception of Tesla making the offhand remark about Jewish people being part of a bad day in a context that suggests humor, irony or potentially even referencing someone else's joke obliquely. Tesla's secretary, George Scherff once made a very mild antisemitic joke in a telegram to Tesla apparently referencing Jewish lawyers being associated with charging high prices in relating Tesla's new Jewish lawyer required a prepaid retainer.

Unlike many American businessmen of the 1930s, Tesla never said anything positive about Hitler.

I don't know if it was the norm, but it was at least so much more common that it wasn't considered unusual.

Besides those alternators he patented, he mentioned building more experimental ones for higher frequencies but only at much low power. 

On the great advance in two-circuit transmission (the transmission half of the four-circuit radio concept), Tesla said,

comment,65at46,65at46,,">This revolving globe generates every moment enough electricity, if it could be stored in batteries, to run all the machinery of the world for the balance of time. At the North Pole this electricity streams off in beautiful red ribbons called the auroras, and we see this phenomenon on account of the highly attenuated condition of the atmosphere. But everywhere, as high as the air reaches, around this earth is this immense wealth of nature, yet man, in his blindness and puniness, continues to manufacture with his little dynamos what nature has placed before him in such abundance. He does not need to manufacture another spark; he needs only to use an infinitesimal fraction of what is already made and the world of intelligence will become a whispering-gallery, and the world of machinery will move in its appointed motion out of forces of the invisible air.

Nernst and colleagues would later develop Tesla's idea that earth's atmosphere contains a lot of energy. Ewald Rasch's [*Electric Arc Phenomena*](https://books.google.com/books?id=Lp8gAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA186&lpg=PA186) (1911) cites a Chwolson who calculated the earth-ionosphere contains 1.3e5 coulombs at 1e9 volts [1 GV] for EJt ≅ 24.7×10²⁴ W⋅s.

First of all, let me say that I am pretty happy with my personal life. Me and my wife frequently go to the movies, hike the mountains, hang at the beach, visit museums and whatnot.

Nevertheless, working at SpaceX (and supposedly the same can be said for Tesla) can be extremely hard, challenging and stressful.

comment,78godk,78godk,,"John G. Trump was an EE professor. Here's his [doctoral thesis on vacuum electrostatics](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/32556) from 1933.

In this report from 1943, he dismissed the military value of Tesla's notes that had been withheld from being released to his family by a wartime government agency, the Office of Alien Property. Part of his reason for this was because, as the report noted at several points, Tesla had already disclosed important ideas to people in relevant industries, military scientists (like his assistant Bloyce Fitzgerald) and physicists like presumably especially Arthur Compton and Alfred Parson. In a 1933 interview, Tesla said he barely slept, so despite people around him saying he was as sharp as ever, you wouldn't expect him to have been doing his best work by that point in his life. His mechanical vibration ideas were probably motivated by having sold all of his electromagnetic wireless power intellectual property to Morgan to fund half of the expense of building Wardenclyffe.

The FBI claims they didn't know what was in the safe or the trunks because the Office of Alien Property collected all the material. In an earlier letter, the FBI says Tesla's nephew was the first to open the safe. The Office of Alien Property just acted on their own, without contacting the FBI, the national security agency at the time? The big glaring fact being squirmed around is why was Office of Alien Property contacted, when Nikola Tesla was a Naturalized US Citizen?

comment,7e2ze2,7e2ze2,,"Bugatti hasn’t even attempted top speed in their car yet. The 261 is just what they limit the car to right now for their customers.

Everyone knows it will be 280mph+, the question is can they find new tires that let them reach 300.

If you read Motor Trend’s review of the Chiron, they said a $180k Turbo S would accelerate as fast in 0-60, but the Chiron feels to accelerate faster from 60-180mph than it does 0-60, that’s where most of the power delivery is.

It’s odd that Tesla only bragged about 0-60 and 0-100mph numbers, for most hyper cars that aim for 250mph+ top speed, they brag about 0-124, 60-150, or 0-200mph time, that’s where the differences lie. 

Actually they mostly brag about lap times around the Nurburgring, since that’s a better indicator of the overall performance of a vehicle.  

One big concern with EV in this context is that due to the nature of EV, a powerful car would require a big battery pack, and current battery technology means it will be a very heavy battery pack. Weight is public enemy number one as far as motor sport engineering is concerned, so the Roadster's track performance is still a big question mark at this point. I personally think if they solve the battery cooling issue, it should be very respectable, but very, very unlikely to be record setting considering some of the [bat shit insane stuff](https://jalopnik.com/the-1000-horsepower-mercedes-amg-project-one-this-is-1803141648) that's coming out right around the same time.",1975,True,1511124011.0,2017-11-19 21:40:11,2668,0,cookingboy,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7e2ze2/tesla_vs_bugatti/dq24dq8/,True,,2017,tesla,top,False,False,0,dq24dq8

comment,7fgglh,7fgglh,,"renewables are cheaper.  To the point that you have to mine an order of magnitude more ore to get enough uranium to produce as much energy as a silicon solar cell- and that is without even considering recycling the solar cells.  Even factoring the cost of batteries in, nuclear just can't compete.  Math:

I'm gonna do the math for one square meter of solar paneling.  That's [186 W of solar cells](http://sinovoltaics.com/learning-center/quality/standard-test-conditions-stc-definition-and-problems/), about [$192 installed](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/68925.pdf), including land cost, taxes, etc etc etc.  A residential system will cost about 3x as much.  Over most of the US, that panel will generate an average of 1 kWh per day (5.5 kWh insolation times 18.6% efficiency).  To a rough approximation you'll need to store about 30% of that power overnight- 300 Wh.  Lets call that $120/kWh for the batteries- that's a reasonable large-scale current cost.  Say it lasts 5000 cycles, same as the Tesla powerwall- 13.7 years.  In reality that could last way, way longer at a slightly higher capacity, but say you just replace it until the panels run out.  That's $192 for the panels and $108 for the batteries, warrantied for at least 41 years.  

That gives you a cost of 2.0 cents per kWh.  Compare to nuclear, where still-unfinished plants are supposed to come in at [9.6 cents per kWh](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf).",1911,True,1511659023.0,2017-11-26 02:17:03,4,0,hwillis,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7fgglh/bernie_sanders_posted_about_teslas_powerpack/dqca7pw/,True,,2017,tesla,top,False,False,0,dqca7pw

It credits Tesla for certain things inaccurately, but fails to credit him for most of what he did. Carlson previously wrote a biography of Elihu Thomson, and his Tesla bio basically calls Tesla a second-rate Elihu Thomson.

I don’t wanna sound like a nay-sayer because I’m far from that, but i also don’t want to fall in the trap of being a blind fan. 

Edit: 

There's been a few replies to this comment and another comment about my ""cautiously optimistic"" statement. I'll try to reply to those comments as well but I wanted to add an edit here to get ahead of the ""you're wrong"" replies. 

My comment here is not meant to say that Tesla will not fulfill their promise, nor am I trying to argue that Tesla is not currently in a good situation. I'm just addressing the comment that the Semi will put Tesla in a good situation. I believe the Semi **can** put Tesla in a good situation but as of right now, it can't do much other than fuel the hype. There are no Tesla's on the road transporting goods, or even Tesla semis in production, it's simply a POC right now and trying to shake up the industry.

Alfred W. Simon patented what looks like Tesla's turbine-powered electrostatic generator in 1933. https://www.google.com/patents/US2004352

Tesla's beam weapon idea could possibly also have been an adapted form of wireless power transmission beam or plasma column.

comment,81xi87,81xi87,,"Your comment had me wondering, how expensive is it really? Obviously the Tesla's are luxury priced, but then again isn't Europe the place where people get taxi'ed in Mercedes? Can the alledged lower running costs of a Tesla Model S make up the cost difference? I dug around and found this

According to [this source](https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/Netherlands/diesel_prices/), the average diesel price in the Netherlands for the past few months has been 1,27 euros per liter, that's $5.9/gallon. Gasoline is even worse, 1.55 euros per liter or $7.22/gallon, but for the sake of the argument let's go with diesel.

According to [this source](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/8/8c/Electricity_prices%2C_first_half_of_year%2C_2015-2017.png), the average **household** price of a kWh of energy in the Netherlands in the 1st semester of last year was 0.156 euros per kWh, non-household is considerably lower, but let's go with worst case scenario.

The first Model S seen in the picture has a 85 kWh battery, according [to this source](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=32557) to be good enough for 265 miles, or 426 km. But let's go with 400 km to round it down, that's 4.7 km per kWh

Now let's find a comparable car to match the Tesla against.

Other audio recording technologies included Edison's 1877 gramophone, and there were also some experimental photographic and photolithographic audio recording methods since the 1890s.

This is interesting considering, in 2018, over 3,000 exoplanets have now been found, several imaged directly. These have been mostly gas giants but the era of finding thousands of small, rocky inner exoplanets is only just starting.  
  
Tesla did go into showman mode during these interviews, so his terminology needs to be understood. He was talking about detecting signals from more than 20 planets, meaning exoplanets. He never claimed to have had two-way communication, he only detected what he thought were communications between these exoplanets. It could be that he was detecting pulsars and not knowing what they were, thought they were communications between star systems.    
  
These are a few areas out of his Colorado Spring testing results that don't get covered because they have been too fringe, until now. He was talking about frequencies up to 10^24 cycles per second. Gamma ray telescopes, which had a Top Secret reason in the 1970's for happening, are now used to monitor stellar events, 10^19 cycles per second.

Jupiter and Mars were close enough in the sky at the time that he mistook one for the other. Unlike Tesla, now we know how that signal is produced and that it is a natural phenomenon that Jupiter and also Saturn can produce that does not indicate an intelligent source.

The additional context raises interesting questions. Was Tesla building ever more powerful radio transmitters in an attempt to communicate with his misinterpreted sign of intelligence? It seems like that may have been the case. His pre-1910 quenched gap radio transmitters were so powerful that quenched gap radio transmitters were banned entirely as one of the first radio regulations. One of Tesla's solutions to the problem of the extreme spectrum limitation imposed by everyone using global-strength radio transmitters was to use complex automatically varied modulation with multiple signals on multiple antennas.

Of course I would complain about the focus being on the War of the Currents period, which was in the 1880s, when everything he did subsequently was a lot more interesting: resonant power transmission, solar energy, cosmic ray energy, x-rays, radioactivity, radio astronomy, wireless power, energy beams for wireless power, robots, electric cars, flying machines and everything else he worked with. Unfortunately much less is known about those later inventions though, so it would be difficult.

Because a movie about his later period is still waiting for someone to write a book about it let alone a screenplay, a book or movie about the group of inventors affiliated with him who were known as ""the Philadelphia crowd"" might be interesting: Harry Shoemaker, Gustav Gehring, Cornelius Ehret, et al.

One inventor affiliated with Tesla already did have a series of successful children's fiction based on him, although not many people know that he was in fact affiliated with Tesla. John Hays Hammond, Jr. was supposed to have inspired Jonny Quest, the 1960s children's animation.

It would probably be easier to make a movie of *Ralph 124C 41+*.

comment,8nsawv,8nsawv,,"The way this script is written, its a bio-pic drama that does touch base on wireless transmission, radio, oscillator technology, remote control, etc. It doesn't focus on the war of the currents as much as most documentaries and fan films have. Although the time period does take place in that period as those were instrumental in the development of his career, this film will focus on many factual events that most neglect to focus on.

In regards to his later years that you mentioned; yes, that would be one amazing aspect to work on, however then it would steer more towards sci-fiction as we simply do not have access to documentation proving what most of us believe to have taken place. The purpose of this movie is to educated while entertaining, and we've found a way around the dry and boring aspects to keep our audience engaged. 

There is a large amount of people in the world, the United States included, that have no idea who Nikola Tesla was or what he did. Most think Tesla is just a car company.

comment,8nsawv,8nsawv,,"The History Channel has a new Tesla series focused on trying to find the Lost Trunks. Tesla had laboratories all over New York, which he was eventually kicked out of for not paying the rent. In the 1930's, he ended up at the Hotel New Yorker where he also had laboratories on a few floors.  
  
Since Tesla was robbed from continuously after Wardenclyffe, he became much more secretive about what he was working on. In a later interview, he mentioned he had 80 large steamer trunks with his research papers. After his death, 50 were found and turned over to the Belgrade museum. That left the question of where the lost trunks went and what was in them. That is what the new series is focused on. They are finding out many things about the New Yorker. It is the same height as the Wardenclyffe tower and had mysterious changes made to its architecture not long before Tesla moved in.

Yes, because the physics of it are fundamentally and unchangeably inefficient.  Power deceases by the square of the distance.  Not to mention that pumping that much electrical energy into the air would turn practically every exposed peice of metal into a live wire.

Intel can't fix that, either.  What they're trying to do is direct beams towards whatever it is they're trying to power, instead of transmitting in all directions.

It has taken over 100 years to find out Wardenclyffe wasn't a Tesla coil, and was not for transmitting power through air. The power was coming out of the air and being transmitted deep underground. It would be similar to burying a Tesla coil upside down into the ground. The legs on the Wardenclyffe tower had solid copper bars in them that were imbedded in giant granite blocks at the base. Granite is an excellent insulator.  

The ""death ray"", which Tesla hated, and called a charged particle beam weapon also has nothing to do with a Tesla coil other than being for the individual microwave beam barrels. A Tesla turbine was being used to produce gigantic electrostatic voltages.

It's bombarded too deep in the glass to be accessible even if it did not also react. The ionized gas might even be able to be bombarded through the glass to the exterior of the bulb. Ionized dust fireballs can be passed through glass, and gas molecules are much smaller. If the bulb absorbs a lot of ions or electrons at a point, it can be heated and pressurized sufficiently to form a tiny bubble of molten glass that bulges from the surface. Tesla described this phenomenon at some point.

The most important step to minimize bombardment hardening to maintain a static vacuum pressure is to use smoother more sinusoidal waves. Tesla developed his 11 kHz 2 KW alternator in 1891 for smoother and better tuned waves than the spark gap oscillators he started with. Apparently preferred a quenched spark gap for maximum efficiency despite noise, but in subsequent decades leading radio engineers developed more powerful higher frequency alternators for early AM radio.

In this patent, Moore uses what he called a very high frequency alternator, but he might only mean as little as around 1-2 kHz by that.

comment,9hmh08,9hmh08,,"This is a pretty simple little concept and sub-component wave responsive device like a coherer. It's an electrometer with hinged plates that move with low inertia. Tesla used it as an electrostatic sensor-switch. Shoemaker used it as a sensor to convert surface waves signals to audio signals. In the terms of the day, this wave responsive device would be called *self-restoring* because unlike a coherer, it doesn't need a decoherer to kick it off again after being switched on.

In later patents, Shoemaker continued to develop this concept into a selective frequency responsive electromagnetically adjustable vibrating switch.

Perhaps more notably, Shoemaker was one of a number of inventors who was also using the ground surface wave model Tesla used, which probably does more to suggest Tesla was working with Shoemaker in some capacity. Shoemaker's patent describes ground surface waves like this, ""The nature of the energy transmitted is principally electrostatic, though there may be some slight component of electromagnetic.""

comment,9m97q7,9m97q7,,"Hmm? Are you exhausting from around the axis of the rotor or from the other input port? The unused input port is only for reversing rotation. Whichever port is unused should be closed instead of being an output port. The air flow of a Tesla turbine is centripetal to the center of the disks, so this looks almost identical to a Tesla turbine, but it's operating very differently. 

One of the neat things about the centripetal flow design is that efficiency increases with rotor speed because the increasing centrifugal force increases resistance to the centripetal flow.

comment,9o8iku,9o8iku,,"Tesla first showed spherical aerial terminals in patents in 1897 (US645576 and US649621), and he was using a spherical aerial at Colorado Springs in 1899, which shows that spherical aerials were originally his idea. 

Spherical aerials don't make sense from a conventional Hertz wave standpoint. This is because they are designed for ground surface wave signaling rather than radiating Hertz waves. For Hertz wave wireless, they don't make as much sense as the more common wire antennas that most other inventors used. With ground surface wave signaling, the aerial isn't an antenna. Instead it is a capacitive waveguide probe that launches surface waves that are bound to the surface(s) of the waveguide. 

Tesla had a complicated relationship with Reginald Fessenden. Like Marconi, Fessenden worked for Edison. And apparently also like Marconi, Fessenden was taking ideas from Tesla without permission. Fessenden once played a sneaky trick on Tesla. He sent a lawyer to Tesla to offer to represent Tesla in a lawsuit that Tesla was not yet even aware had been filed against him (by a third party over an invention), but that lawyer was secretly collecting information from Tesla in order to represent Fessenden to try to claim credit for certain inventions from Tesla. This information only became available from some of Tesla's telegrams that were not released until the past decade.

comment,9o8iku,9o8iku,,"That's a good point. Tesla was using megavolts when everyone else was using kilovolts, which was a very important reason for the shape of the terminal. In [US645576](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/645576.pdf), his first patent with spherical terminals from 1897, he mentioned producing potentials of 2-4 megavolts. In 1899, I believe he mentioned reaching around 15 MV at Colorado Springs. And by the 1920s, he was talking about using 100 MV for power transmission. If he used a pointier terminal that leaked ions, it would take a lot more power to attain those voltages if it would be possible at all. 

He first depicted a segmented aerial terminal like those in your link in [US1119732](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/1119732.pdf), his 1907 magnifying transmitter patent.

Tesla board member, Steve Jurvetson called it ""the most extraordinary act of entrepreneurial zeal and commitment I've ever seen.""

&#x200B;

The financing round was falling apart because the entire global economy appeared to be on brink of collapse, and investors were extremely skittish about investing in a car startup that was on the verge of bankruptcy. At the last hour, Elon essentially said, ""screw it, I'll personally finance the entire round."" Elon was willing to go net negative on his net worth to save Tesla. This changed the mood in the room and the round closed.

comment,ad2w07,ad2w07,,"It is just a plain, simple fact that this planet, Earth, has a gigantic electrostatic field, that increases to thousands and thousands of volts, the higher the altitude. The problem with street-level popular history is that it has to take significant discovery events and trivialize them, making them more prurient for layman consumption. This is what happened with Benjamin Franklin and his kite in a lightning storm, using a silk string as the electrostatic conductor. It wasn't the fact there was lightning that was significant. It was that Franklin discovered he could acquire thousands of volts with his kite, and that would conduct to the key he had as the collector. What history didn't note is that was in 1752. The Leyden jar was invented in 1745. Franklin found he could charge banks of Leydon jars (capacitors) with his simple kite and key collector. Franklin goes to France in 1774, to lobby for French support against the British, and promptly forgets what he is doing, spending most of his time with French royalty and their almost daily partying, and orgies. One of the novelties he introduced was getting a shock from a Leyden jar as a therapeutic and titillating jolt.  
  
The factors to note, one, is the Leyden jar is a capacitor with a solid dielectric.

comment,ad2w07,ad2w07,,"Yeah, there are a lot of popular misconceptions about what Franklin did. His kite was not struck by lightning like many people think. He would have been injured and probably would not have survived if it had been struck. And while he was primarily trying to prove that lightning was a manifestation of static electric, as you say, his more momentous feat may have been in discovering the high strength of atmospheric electrostatic charge.

The power of atmospheric electric was brought to the fore again by European scientists in the 1920s. Looking for megavolts for nuclear research they turned to suspending large nets high in the air to collect potentials as high as 5-30 megavolts. https://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Electrical-Experimenter/SI-1928-06.pdf

Telluric currents in Earth are incredibly large but the potential is very low. If we reinforce and strengthen Martian telluric currents, maybe we could cause Mars to accumulate an atmosphere. Or closer to home, if we disturb Earth's telluric currents sufficiently, maybe we could dangerously impair the conditions that make life possible on earth including retaining our atmosphere.

I think it's too bad that you are not getting the support you want. However, I think the answer to why this is happening is hidden in this reply right here. It may well be that Tesla (or their advisers) have come to the conclusion that if they start creating solutions for the Turkish market, the will have ""entered that market"", and therefore be obliged to provide additional support to Turkish Tesla owners, follow specific Turkish regulations etc. 

In other words, fixing a small issue in relation to Turkey might bring other consequences with it for the company. Not saying I agree with that stance, and of course I think it'd be really good if Tesla entered all markets to help move everyone to a sustainable mode of transport, but it may be the explanation.

Wardenclyffe had a coal-fired power plant with boiler, steam turbine and generators. Most of it was from Westinghouse. Tesla apparently considered it a payment or gift, but Westinghouse eventually repossessed it years later saying he had never paid.

Tesla apparently intended to use two different wireless transmission methods simultaneously. One was a ground component, and the other was a sky component. It's possible one component automatically produced the other. It's not clear.

Moray's new nuclear technology has confused a lot of people over the years because for a long time he used an antenna to generate power by amplifying an ambient noise signal. That lead many to believe that he must be receiving a large amount of radio power somehow. The way that he talked about receiving energy in his book contributed to that misunderstanding.

Instead of receiving a huge amount of radio energy, which is impossible, his device worked by converting mass to particle energy in some nuclear reaction and then converting particle energy into electric charge. The radio noise input might not be anything besides a convenient arbitrary AC signal to amplify. The way that Moray said that it received external power appears to have been related to Tesla's theory that radioactivity is caused by some external radiation disturbing the mass energy in radioactive matter.

Westinghouse only owned Westinghouse Electric for 21 years after starting it in 1886.

comment,b4f7mf,b4f7mf,,"Watched this on Netflix. A lot of people don't know, or don't realize, Edison's greatest invention was the Mercenary Corporation, that is the model of all corporations today. There are several aspects to the mercenary corporation but the main one is the workers, and their intellectual property, are owned by the corporation.  
  
Westinghouse also invented a corporation but it was a more benevolent corporation, where the workers were more like a family, growing the corporation while the corporation took care of the workers and their families. It never caught on and died out with the passing of Westinghouse.    
  
Anyway, it is too late. What's done is done. We are all living in the Henry Ford - internal combustion engine, Thomas Edison - metered electric utilities and mercenary corporations, J.P. Morgan - utility and corporate vulture banking, and  Albert Einstein - matter before energy. In this timeline, the CO2 and CH4 emissions from ICE (internal combustion engines) for all transportation and farming, and corporate scale farming and cattle ranch clearing of forests, is starting to increase geometrically. The Point Of No Return (PONR) is around 2040, when Zero Emissions must be achieved. This isn't going to happen.

Thomas Edison was America's most famous and successful patent troll.

He did start out as a real inventor but by around 1880 he didn't invent anything after including most of the things he's known for. He commercialized preexisting inventions without licensing intellectual property, which is what most people would call stealing including the British courts who awarded Joseph Swan priority in inventing the light bulb. He took credit for everything his employees did. He didn't invent the phonograph. He read an article about a French invention and copied it. (The accidental genius in that invention was creating a successful new medium makes others create a library of media for it.) Edison invented the story about Marconi inventing radio in order to take inventions from Tesla and the people Tesla was working with like John Stone Stone.

For absolutely sure. For the record, steering out of the way like that should not be a human's gut reaction because if you steer into oncoming traffic (particularly a highway) it could lead to a significantly worse crash, and on top of that you would be 100% liable for any crash/damage that occurred as a result of that maneuver. If the autopilot was able to reliably determine there was no oncoming car and steer out of the way to avoid the front end collision, that is a really good outcome!

The interior is bigger than my Audi A4 was and the baby carrier was a tight fight with my tall self in front of it.  So you should have no problems.  Added bonus being able to turn on the heat or AC from the app is great especially with kids involved.

No idea about noise, this is the quietest vehicle I’ve ever been in. The only annoying part is if anything in the car makes noise you’ll hear.  For instance thought something was rattling with the car, was my damn garage door opener.

As for charging it’s not as cold where I live. I scheduled my charges to start earlier since it’s slow to charge when cold, but the bonus is that the battery will warm up and you’ll have regenerative braking when you go to leave in the morning (because when the battery is cold it’s diminished).",912,False,1558359902.0,2019-05-20 15:45:02,21,0,[deleted],teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/bqui49/my_model_3_1_year_old_28000km_22_updates_only_300/eo87zyf/,True,,2019,tesla,top,False,False,0,eo87zyf

comment,c0bt9b,c0bt9b,,"This is the other Tesla coil and coil winding method that time seems to have forgotten about because it was overshadowed by the iconic high voltage Tesla coil. This is essentially the idea of using the distributed capacitance of a coil and especially using distributed capacitance to move current through a coil without normal impedance. Neutralizing impedance increases quality factor, increases the peak magnetic field strength of current, and can be used to widely broaden the bandwidth of resonance (at least with two conductors or with more conductors or sections the resonant bandwidth can be sharper for better filtering). 

The leftmost inventions show preceding ideas where two coils in proximity are wound oppositely. That is kind of similar but it's not the same idea. And before Elihu Thomson patented that as a lightning transient filter, Charles J. Van Depoele patented that slightly different winding for use on a motor in the 1880s. 

Richard Varley patented the idea in Canada for an induction coil in 1892, the year before Tesla patented it in the US, but Tesla once said ""the Varley coil"" was his idea. In fact if I'm remembering correctly, Tesla said Roentgen was using an induction coil he got from Varley when Roentgen discovered x-rays. 

""The Varley coil"" as it's described later is an x-ray transformer a little different from the 1892 patent.

When the cops arrived I just told the cop(s) that I had a video when he needed it and was let go (the cops didn't want us to stay for fear of another accident).  When the police called me I had this clip ready (I only noticed the White Model 3 getting hit when I pulled the video).

The Cop did ask how I was able to provide all the footage so I told him its standard on Teslas.

Filming capabilities: What I showed is a standard option* on all Model 3s. You have to set up the ability to record using a formatted USB drive (FAT32) and a folder on the drive called TeslaCam.

comment,c0bt9b,c0bt9b,,"Tesla didn't invent coil windings, that was Oersted that did that. It became standard to wind them as stacked spirals. The flat coil winding that Tesla developed was unlike anything before because it only works with High Voltage High Frequency Alternating Current. Tesla was not the inventor of AC but he most certainly was the inventor of High Voltage High Frequency Alternating Current (HVHFAC).  
  
Tesla claimed he visualized his designs on the back of his head, in a 2-inch square box, completely finished. He completely designed the entire electrical power grid, even to the point of using aluminum wire for the HVHFAC power transmission, down to every component. But, as soon as he was done with that, he basically saw it as obsolete, and developed the wireless transmission of electric power. There is massive historical confusion there. Wardenclyffe was not a Tesla coil, although it had one in it to act as a ""pump"", it was an electric energy harvester, and the power transmission was through the ground. He demonstrated the use of the flat winding resonant coil to the US Patent Office, with a working model. This air transmission of electric power is a different method, but Tesla said it would send large amounts of power around the globe, as easy as he was demonstrating to the patent office.

comment,c0bt9b,c0bt9b,,"> Tesla didn't invent coil windings, that was Oersted that did that. 

Oersted discovered the magnetic field of current and that looping wire increased the magnetic field, but he's not associated with any particular winding or coil, is he? 

Maxwell and Helmholtz invented certain coils that bear their names. Both their coils are designed to produce a uniform field within an interior space.

Tesla patented a coil winding for electromagnets in 1893 using multiple windings or multifilar wire wound in parallel and wired in series, [US512340](https://patents.google.com/patent/US512340). And that is the idea all these inventions except Thomson's share. 

And as I wrote in the previous comment, I believe at some point he said the Varley coil first patented in Canada in 1892 was also his idea. The Varley coil is the same idea in the form of a multifilar solenoid induction coil, which Tesla mentioned in his patent. People patenting Tesla's ideas for ignition coils and magnetos for internal combustion engines include Richard Varley, Richard Cunningham, James Seeley, Leon Jules Le Pontois, George H. Ennis, Frank Conrad, Edward B. Jacobson, John Heany, August R Luschka, Justus Entz, Harold P. Donle, Homer C. Snook, Alfons H. Neuland, Vincent G. Apple, Arthur Atwater Kent and Charles Kettering. Kettering is usually credited for inventing spark ignition, but Tesla patented disruptive discharge ignition 10 years before him.

comment,d5ejm2,d5ejm2,,"I have to say a 7:23 Nürburgring lap time with the 2020 Model S Plaid pre-production version is pretty darn impressive: the Taycan's pre-production version lap record was done a month ago, in August with 10-20 degrees higher temperatures, when the density of air was 3-6% lower.

For example in the Nürburgring straights when cars can reach their top speeds, top speed is in a roughly linear relationship with drag. I.e. if for example if Tesla top speed in yesterday's run was 290 kmh, then in August it would have been somewhere around 300 kmh, depending on exact air temperature on the track.

This is why most (EV) Nürburgring records are best set in warm weather.

Another thing is that the Taycan is not made in real volumes yet and there's a pre-order list, so if you order the Taycan today you likely will only receive it in about a year, when the Tesla Model S Plaid version is expected to be released.

This is why I believe Tesla is publicly showcasing track performance of next year's Model S Plaid, to reduce ~~cannibalization~~ any lost sales to the Porsche Taycan.

Regarding the lack of a SuperCharger at the Nürburgring and the use of a DC generator: should Tesla indeed officially beat the Taycan's 7:42 lap time I'm pretty sure a new Nürburgring SuperCharger is secured! 🤠

comment,davluw,davluw,,"I doubt a decent compressed air engine can be 3D printed.

This video seemed to imply Tesla only produced one reciprocating steam/air engine patent, but he produced several. One purpose of his reciprocating engines was to produce sinusoidal high frequency AC for lighting, wireless signaling and wireless power transmission. Another purpose was to produce a clock timing device. Another purpose was apparently to produce a vibrating engine for powering a shaking table for processing mining ores. A shaking table prototype is apparently the device that made Mark Twain suddenly need to use the bathroom in that one story. 

The way that the reciprocating engine worked as an earthquake machine is also very interesting. As Tesla described it, it was designed to operate with so little friction that it could respond to the minute sympathetic vibration of the structure to which it was attached, so it would begin oscillating at a very, very low rate and only speed up as the vibration built up in the attached object.

comment,dij9tx,dij9tx,,"Tesla said he originally thought of his bladeless turbine idea as a pump for pumping mercury while he was working for Edison in 1884. Edison's vacuum light bulbs were made using a mercury-column vacuum pump.

Geissler had used a mercury-column vacuum pump that was later named a [Sprengel pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprengel_pump) to make his discharge tubes.

William Crookes made his own copies of Geissler's tubes to study them to discover that while electrified, the gas inside was a different state of matter that he termed radiant matter in his 1879 treatise. Today we call Crooke's radiant matter plasma.

Crookes's experiments inspired Joseph Swan to invent the carbon filament vacuum incandescent light bulb. Edison copied Swan's idea from a scientific magazine and falsely claimed it as his own original invention.

Edison committed intellectual property theft like this repeatedly. He was an unscrupulous man devoid of honor, but he was wealthy enough to buy journalists to say what he wanted people to think about him and project the false image of himself as legendary that the poorly-informed majority of people still believe today.

Edison didn't invent the light bulb, he stole the idea, but he did mass produce it to sell at a lower price than Swan. As he achieved great financial success, he improved on Swan's idea. He used a stronger vacuum pump, so the bulbs lasted longer. He produced a stronger vacuum by using a vacuum pump with a taller column of mercury.",2213,True,1571718796.0,2019-10-22 06:33:16,3,0,dalkon,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/dij9tx/so_i_built_this_tesla_turbine/f4p7tq8/,True,,2019,tesla,top,False,False,0,f4p7tq8

Morgan, Sr. causing the Knickerbocker Crisis (Panic of 1907) by starting the rumor that the Knickerbocker Bank was insolvent in order to takeover multiple banks and other large companies including taking Westinghouse Electric from George Westinghouse, then it's historically inaccurate propaganda.

comment,epf1o0,epf1o0,,"You're making assumptions instead of reading original sources to learn what Tesla was talking about. Tesla repeatedly said that his wireless power methods didn't use radio waves. He agreed the inverse square law dispersion of radio waves made it impossible to use radiated waves to transmit power efficiently over meaningful distances. It is apparently possible to transmit large amounts of power over distances of up to about one mile with low frequency radio waves, but the efficiency is low. Surface waves are more efficient than radio waves because they only disperse in two dimensions instead of three, but the methods Tesla intended to use were non-dispersive.

Tesla had multiple efficient wireless power transmission systems. One method used plasma columns or filaments to transmit power through the air and the other method transmitted current through the earth as a rotating magnetic field. 

Daniel Watts Troy and August Kloneck patented the lower efficiency radio wave and surface wave methods. John Hettinger and Conrad Reno patented wireless power transmission by plasma conductors. And Charles Roe patented the earth current method. I've posted the patents here before.

Tesla said Hettinger's idea of using UV light to create the plasma conductor wouldn't work because it was too easily affected by wind.

3. plasma columns or filaments for point-to-point transmission  
4. rotating magnetic field transmission through earth. This method could possibly be an alternative method of transmitting and receiving surface waves.

Notably all those methods can be accomplished without a giant tower. Wardenclyffe was probably a giant tower because it was also intended to harness power using the same concepts as Hermann Plauson's later work with atmospheric power that used towers or tethered balloons to collect power from the atmosphere and solar wind. https://patents.google.com/patent/US1540998",828,False,1583536268.0,2020-03-07 00:11:08,1,0,dalkon,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/epf1o0/nikola_tesla_predicted_the_modern_day_smart_phone/fjowh77/,True,,2020,tesla,hot,False,False,0,fjowh77

comment,ftf878,ftf878,,"Tesla obtained several patents on reciprocating engines and engine-generators, which is what his mechanical oscillators were.  
・[Tesla reciprocating generator 1893 US511916](https://patents.google.com/patent/US511916)  
・[Tesla reciprocating engine 1893 US514169](https://patents.google.com/patent/US514169)  
・[Tesla reciprocating engine 1894 US517900](https://patents.google.com/patent/US517900)  

The main idea of the invention was reducing a steam engine and dynamo combination to the least complicated form possible by using reciprocating linear motion instead of rotary motion. Tesla said he used it to power the lights in his lab for a number of years after inventing it.

https://teslaresearch.jimdofree.com/oscilators/mechanical-oscilator/  
https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/articles/teslas-oscillator

As I understand it, the main concept behind using a mechanical oscillator to cause destructive mechanical resonance—which Tesla would later say could be used to demolish a building—is active friction reduction so the oscillator responds to the extremely feint sympathetic vibration that it creates in the object it vibrates.

---

Tesla did more with his reciprocating engines than I first remembered. He said it's possible to use a reciprocating engine to transmit vibrational energy through the ground for a mechanical form of wireless power transmission, and he pointed to great possibilities for using them for prospecting. He called this work the art of telegeodynamics.

comment,gv6tjx,gv6tjx,,"To correct a small point in this, Tesla didn't think Marconi could signal across the Atlantic using only the single-tuned circuit radio transmitter and receiver that Marconi had patented, which is accurate. Marconi had to use Tesla's four-circuit system to succeed. The four-circuit/multi-stage resonance concept is necessary for sharp tuning at the transmitter and selective tuning at the receiver. Without the multi-stage resonant circuit concept, it requires impossibly huge amounts of power to overcome noise. 

Tesla first patented the two-stage resonant oscillator in 1896 ([US568178](https://www.google.com/patent/US568178)). He subsequently patented its use specifically for single-wire power transmission in 1897 ([US593138](https://www.google.com/patent/US593138)) and in 1899, surface wave power transmission and high-altitude plasma power transmission ([US649621](https://www.google.com/patent/US649621), [US645576](https://www.google.com/patent/US645576)). 

John Stone Stone patented the circuit for radio and he credited Tesla as the originator of the concept. 

Marconi used the four-circuit concept in violation of Tesla's patents, which was what the Supreme Court decided in 1943. http://www.mercurians.org/1999_Spring/rereading.htm

Unfortunately, they didn't know that Marconi was lying; that he'd been using Tesla's ""unproven"" ideas in order to broadcast across the Atlantic.   Soon Marconi company was selling Tesla coils, even selling Tesla's ""Extra Coil"" or ""magnifier.""   But he called them ""oscillation transformers"" and ""loading coils.""

Another bit: William Preece of the UK govt. was working with Marconi, and they range-tested the Tesla transmitter.  They found that its range far exceeded Marconi's patented transmitter invention.  Preece insisted that Marconi license Tesla's technology.  Marconi refused.   Then (by pure coincidence?) Preece and the UK government suddenly broke ties to Marconi.  Why?  It's a mystery.  Marconi had to scramble to create a new company.

A couple of online history articles say that the UK suddenly dropped Marconi because of Marconi's overtly-planned idea-theft of Tesla's technology.

comment,i83fts,i83fts,,"Tesla or possibly Hugo Gernsback commissioned this sketch. ~~It appears to depict some type of plasma beams connecting to the ground or upper atmosphere from the power receivers. Tesla said that transmitting power by at least one of his wireless power methods would create an artificial aurora in the vicinity of the power receiver. Where this sketch shows beams with straight edges, they might really be more like snaking plasma streamers.~~ People who lived in the neighborhood of his Long Island tower said it made incredible light shows at night.

The title of this post says it uses radio waves, but that's incorrect. It's easy to tell if someone doesn't know what they're talking about if they say Tesla wanted to transmit power by radio waves. Tesla repeatedly said radio waves couldn't transmit power efficiently because they are too dispersive. He had at least two wireless methods: point-to-point plasma conductors and surface waves. The method depicted here might be a hybrid of the two. He patented point-to-point plasma power transmission in 1897 (US645576) and surface wave power transmission in 1900 (US649621).

Books are disappointing too. None of the many biographies of him has covered his business, which was selling inventions to other inventors. No one has told that story yet, so it's very unlikely this film would. 

The villains of Tesla's story at least up to around 1915 are J.P. Morgan (first and foremost), Thomas Edison, Mihajlo Pupin, Elihu Thomson and Guglielmo Marconi. And they are heroes to too many other people, so it's unlikely the true story about what they did to Tesla will be told. 

J.P. Morgan caused the Panic of 1907 by spreading rumors about the Knickerbocker Trust (a large bank) in order to take control of Westinghouse Electric after Westinghouse refused to sell his company to him. Morgan already owned General Electric, and his business model was monopoly. 

The real story of Tesla is also not quite as tragic as biographies relate. For a long time, he earned a good income selling inventions.

Lightning is DC, direct current. Lightning bolts are due to direct current.  
  
The sparks from a Tesla coil are not DC, they are AC, alternating current at a very high voltage and high frequency.  
  
Tesla's Wardenclyffe tower was not a Tesla coil (flyback transformer) although it did have one inside that acted as a pump. The Wardenclyffe tower didn't have giant sparks, it was illuminated by the pulsing glow of ionized air. What Tesla was doing was ""pumping"" the static E-field into oscillation, like continuously throwing rocks in the middle of a pond, at a very high frequency. The aircraft are like a toy boat in the pond, being rocked by the waves. They are electric aircraft, not needing batteries. The finished Wardenclyffe tower is an Energy Harvester, pulling electricity from the air and transmitting it deep underground.

You can't convince me that Meyl is a hack based on reputation bashing. I've studied his work and it's not jibberish. I also accept all other known Maxwell equations and they are testable and we use them in a practical way every day with our current understanding.

comment,ikcdb7,ikcdb7,,"Tesla's last patent is for a VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) biplane in 1928.  
  
He did talk about communicating with other planets (noting he left out any reference to planets in this stellar system but thought they were from the direction of Mars).  
1901: http://www.teslacollection.com/tesla_articles/1901/colorado_springs_gazette/nikola_tesla/nikola_tesla_and_his_talk_with_other_worlds  
  
He never filed patents for any disk aircraft. However, he spoke about an Electric Stratocruiser in 1911, along with a 3-view sketch, no wings, no propellers, later, in 1925 and the illustration of it is in the upper right corner of the magazine issue cover art. That is not a dirigible or blimp. That is an Electric Stratocruiser hovering, and it could then go supersonic once reaching the stratosphere. No batteries but did need operating energy harvester towers producing high voltage, high frequency energy waves in the Earth's electric field. 
The link below appears to be the original sketch he did for his interview during 1911. As everybody knows the lore, Tesla could hand draw extremely detailed engineering drawings but they were all the size of a large postage stamp, with his explanation that was how he saw things and the only way he could bring them out. He had a lifelong partnership with a machinist and mechanical engineer, and he is the one that did all the final drawings and model building.

Tesla kept a safe in his room. He was dead for 3 days before the hotel maid found him, because he had put a Do Not Disturb sign on his door. Tesla would not have done this, because he required a huge stack of linens each morning. Neither she or the hotel clerk noticed if the safe was open or not. The hotel clerk immediately informed the FBI of Tesla's death, since he was under FBI surveillance, and there were 2 FBI agents living on the same floor. The FBI says when they entered his room, the safe was already opened. The story is the hotel informed Tesla's nearest next of kin, his nephew, of his death, and the nephew hired a locksmith to open the safe. The nephew said the safe was already open and he had hired the locksmith to change the lock.    
  
The FBI chose Dr. John Trump to go through all the trunks they had collected. John Trump wrote a summary at the end, with the conclusion being ""nothing of significance and mostly self-serving and promotional material"".

Tesla just doesn't make quality products and industry experts freely pointed the issues out early on, there was one expert who described how inefficient the whole process was (I believe it was just one rear quarter panel that was done in 28+ steps as opposed to 3 step industry standard. There were also random pieces of rubber glued on because they couldn't identify the source of leaks. Not to mention how Tesla quietly swaps out entire motors and drivetrain components without consumer being made aware of it during routine physical service or updates. They don't even actually know whether their cars are reliable or not, all of this is very bad).

comment,ipp3e9,ipp3e9,,"I think your framework is correct, but your analysis is wrong. Here are some inconsistencies I noticed in your theory:

When you say:

>**Catalysts**: These are are things required to trigger a bubble collapse. Almost every bubble has had some notable catalyst(s) to trigger the rapid decline. As mentioned in Profit Taking, **we've had three catalysts occur so far that triggered panic selling. New Tesla shares, secondary Tesla offloading, and Softbank.** They are the big one and who I will focus on for a minute.

Why do you think Tesla stock split + dilution is a catalyst for the market crash? I don't think that makes sense. As for Softbank, they bought calls in mainly the FAANG stocks, they didn't buy Calls on the whole market. Could Tech stocks crashing back to say, April levels, bring us back to SPY under 300? Sure. But re-test and breach the March lows? No way, not with the amount of liquidity sloshing around out there with 0% Interest Rates.

>Market cap to GDP was 2:1 at peak. The dotcom crash was 1.4 and the recession was 1.1. Currently 1.77:1.

The Wilshire Index (AKA the ""Buffet Indicator"") is outdated and no longer relevant in my opinion. It's supposed to be a measure of US domiciled publicly traded companies Market Cap vs the GDP of the US. What it doesn't take into account however, is that most US business do business overseas, and not just in the US.

It's very interesting that the bull and bear traps look exactly the same and they exist very close to each other on the spectrums (the bear trap basically leads right into the bull trap, post blow-off.). That's totally where my issue lies in my own argument. I wasn't sure if this was another violent shake-off leading into the last phase or if it was the crash itself. I'm still not entirely convinced it's not the crash though. Like you said, there needs to be confirmation one way or another.

It really doesn't take much to start a bubble crashing. One thing can cause others to compound on each other. Catalysts don't all have to be covid level to trigger a collapse. Looking into the dotcom bust, the catalyst was money managers urging their clients to rebalance their portfolios. That looks awfully similar to Tesla's second largest stockholder doing the same. Nothing is ever the same twice, and it's totally ridiculous to count Tesla as the main driver of this, but at the same time, they represent the emotional sentiment of this market as a whole.

In my opinion, Tesla paint is not “crap”. There’s irregularities from a QC standpoint, so 1 out of every X vehicles might have uneven paint applied, or something along those lines. The rarity of that variable for X is probably much higher than you would be lead to believe. Although it might not be on par with the rest of the auto industry on average, and some customers are justifiably upset, the vast majority of owners probably don’t think twice about it, and experience no issues. I know 3 people who own model 3’s, all for 2+ years. Their paint looks great, nothing off about it, and they have no complaints. So, the upset minority speaks the loudest, and over-represents these types of issues. I’m not saying it isn’t an issue, people should expect better QC on the whole when purchasing a $50K car.

comment,kpeffw,kpeffw,,"Perhaps we are indeed due for a dramatic correction. I think the difference for this ""bubble"" is in the quality/quantity of the underlying companies behind the securities.

In the dotcom bubble, there was a plethora of companies for every problem -- and they all promised to be the end-all, be-all.

Today, there are only a few companies for every problem -- and the reason the companies are worth so much is because there is no doubt that they deserve the faith bestowed upon then.

If I believe in online retail as an industry worth investing in, wouldn't a wise investment be Amazon? Would you say I'm being unwise to put money in Facebook if I want to invest in social media and marketing? Sure, there are other players that cover bases that the biggest companies don't do well enough -- but they are niche cases.

Even Tesla, which is arguably overvalued, is a company with great promise. If I had to put my eggs in the basket of a company that I believe will solve our transportation needs for the foreseeable future, it's them. Really, the main thing that's going to cause their valuation to pop is if they prove themselves to be unworthy of our faith.

Perhaps a good analogy would be: *In the 90s, we had a million Nikolas. Today, it’s a million Tesla shareholders.*

comment,kpeffw,kpeffw,,"The investment thesis *isn’t* that we will all be driving EVs tomorrow, or in 5 years.

The investment thesis is that Tesla will be on the forefront of the EVs that we are driving. They will hold patents and intellectual property that will influence the entire auto industry in terms of decades.

Their battery technology will reinvent the way we think about every electronic device. Their solar innovations, everything we thought about power generation.

Think about it: Plenty of companies are trying to make a good EV. Plenty are trying to develop autonomous vehicles. Tesla isn’t trying to get us all in an EV in 5 years — they *fully anticipate* that our cars will drop us off for work, and then go transport other people before picking us up at the end of the day.

I really think that Musk is the Steve Jobs of transportation. If there’s a better way to do things entirely, he can see it, and he heads straight for it. He doesn’t chip away at incremental improvements to an unsatisfactory model; he makes the incremental improvements necessary to achieve the ideal solution.

Now, Tesla has plenty of wood to chop to get there. But is an investor’s faith misguided? Is there another company that is a wiser choice?

comment,l7fw2f,l7fw2f,,"First of all, I'll note that I'm not an expert in this, but here's my understanding. I'm sure someone will correct me quickly enough if I'm wrong (the fastest way to find something out on the internet: say it wrong, and someone will rapidly scream at you how much of an idiot you are)

Unfortunately there's no nice easy ""story time"" analogy like short selling to help explain it super simply. But Puts and Calls are fairly easy concepts anyway, with ways to over-complicate them. The simple version, in both cases, is you're paying a premium/fee now, in order to be able to buy (call) or sell (put) at a fixed price in future.

You pay the fee either way, and it's non-refundable. In return, you are given an ""option"" (choice) of whether you want to execute your put/call in future. That's where the name ""Option"" comes from - you're buying an option to buy/sell at a fixed price in future.

For example I might think TSLA is going to rise in price in the next year, but I want to limit my losses to 20% of my current holding in case I'm wrong. I can buy a Put Option on TSLA at, say, 90% of the current price, and pay a fee of about 10% of the current price. Then in a year, I have an option to sell my TSLA shares at 90% of the current price. I'm down my fee and the 10% loss, but if the price has dropped to 50% in a year, I've massively reduced my risk. The downside being that if the price goes up 20% in a year, I'm only actually up 10% because I've paid a fee for my Option.",2531,True,1611893728.0,2021-01-29 05:15:28,144,0,audigex,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/l7fw2f/elon_burn_ouch/gl6ydp8/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,gl6ydp8

comment,l7qlfh,l7qlfh,,"Yeah... So I've found a pretty massive wrench in everyone's thesis.

The short interest results that were posted 1/27 were actually settled 1/15. There has been enough volatility in the past 2 weeks for shorts to easily close out without anyone noticing. If that's true, it would make sense for them (or anyone) to short again while above 300, especially if they knew the original 61 million shorts were already cleared.

People also keep saying ""Days to Cover is still 2.5!"" Yeah, that doesn't mean anything in a volatile market like this. Days to Cover, aka Short Interest, is a function of (Shares Shorted) / (Avg Volume). Avg volume is over the past 30 days. The first 15 of the past 30 days saw much lower volume. Current Short Ratio is closer to 0.5-1. If they could cover their entire positions in 1 day (causing a spike obviously), who's to say they didn't clear over a 10 day period (causing the spikes we saw), then, knowing they lost $4 billion (if cleared around the $62 price range, which I suspect), why not take out new short positions around $300? The price can't go up any more if there's no short squeeze coming.

Just my 2 cents. I get downvoted for this on WSB, so it's apparent no one wants to objectively discuss this very real possibility.

Gamestop on the other hand, anyone with half a brain and an internet account knows doesn't have much of a business model anymore (certainly not something to justify current valuation levels) so sooner or later people (even the amateurs) are going to realize that its in a price bubble unrelated to its fundamentals.

This was back in 2015 so the exact details are foggy, but my buddy hit a curb in his Tesla and caused an issue in the suspension. The fix for it requires Tesla to remove the whole ass battery to get to some screw.

comment,lg54b5,lg54b5,,"I'm far more of an Elon skeptic than an Elon fan, but as someone who got in early on the Starlink Beta, I've been impressed. 

I think there *are* advantages to having someone like Elon at the helm, who just ""gets things done."" 

I was thinking about this in relation to the [beta invite](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/27/spacex-starlink-service-priced-at-99-a-month-public-beta-test-begins.html) I got.   Any other company would have had it go through a marketing department, get corporate colors applied, and be A/B tested through like 12 rounds of revisions. 

It was obvious that someone at SpaceX was just like, ""This is funny send it out!""  

And you know what?  It worked well.  All those designs and revisions and everything else would have slowed down the process, and cost money and not actually added any value. 

If you think about those types of operations happening thousands of ways throughout an Elon company, you begin to see why they can get things to market faster than their competitors, and be more efficient. 

The actual beta experience has been really good.  Took us from ~8mbps to 150mbps.  Early on it had pretty regular downtime (about a few minutes every hour), but it's been improving regularly.  

It'll be interesting to see if speeds/performance suffer as more users are added, but if they can keep delivering the experience we've had, I have no doubt it'll be a long term success, at least from a demand standpoint.",1723,True,1612891039.0,2021-02-09 18:17:19,209,0,AtOurGates,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lg54b5/spacex_begins_accepting_99_preorders_for_its/gmptuxq/,True,,2021,elon,top,False,False,0,gmptuxq

Model 3 is no slouch when it comes to handling but it's not close to that level.

Plus the Taycan it's a lot faster and has a way more comparable range to the Model 3 than it looks on paper.

All of this is to say that, even the fact that you could compare the two is crazy, I'll agree with you.

The real comparisons that are ridiculously skewed to Model 3's favor are the ones that compare it to other luxury performance sedans at the same point, though. Like the Model 3 Performance is so much above those in terms of speed, practicality, and features, that one wonders why the hell would anybody buy anything else.

Yields are going up because inflation is going up. If you are buying debt, and inflation is rising faster than the interest rate, then you're essentially _paying_ the borrower for access to your money. So bond buyers are demanding higher interest rates right now, causing yields to increase as well.

Then your super safe index investor begins to look at historically high bond yields compared to SPY and it's risks, and decides to invest in bond indexes. This outflow causes SPY and it's components to go lower. Someone that was invested in TSLA will look at how low SPY is and it's relative security, and invest into that. This will lower the price of TSLA, making it attractive to the CCIV holder, etc. 

The whole thing is a feedback loop because this shift into bonds really does make stocks go down, _and_ at the same time feel more risky, causing people to but ""safe"" bonds.

comment,lt7oop,lt7oop,,"> As reported by Bloomberg, JPM strategists Joyce Chang and Amy Ho opined that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against fluctuations from traditional assets like bonds, stocks, and commodities. 

I don't think bitcoin works as a hedge against market fluctuations. It appears that, when the stock market crashes, bitcoin crashes even more.  Compare the graphs of March 2020 between bitcoin, and a stock market index to see for yourself. 

Further, due to the massive amount of electricity bitcoin wastes (A lot of it is from coal power.) bitcoin doesn't belong in a world worried about global warming.  All of this massive computing power is being wasted solving pointless problems.  There are far less wasteful cryptocurrencies like XRP and ADA.",743,False,1614381517.0,2021-02-27 00:18:37,19,0,remorseless_skeptic,investing,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lt7oop/jpmorgan_advises_clients_to_expose_1_of_their/gownw7y/,True,,2021,elon,top,False,False,0,gownw7y

[Latest Update!](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/m8ac8v/130am_update_still_trapped_at_a_supercharger/grji3sv)

EDIT:

FINAL UPDATE - Apologies for taking so long to give an update here, I just wanted to wait to confirm whether this was an ongoing issue or not. Once Tesla got engaged, they were great about getting the car in quickly and doing all the diagnostic work they could think of. They had even seen my Reddit posts, so they were up to date on the situation without having to explain anything.

The weren’t able to replicate the issue, but wound up replacing the charge port anyway to be safe. The data from the car suggested a voltage spike during charging which caused the charge port to enter a fault  state and shut off. It’s unclear why the cord would not disengage, but I’m assuming it was able to do so once that fault cleared itself overnight. This makes some sense as it was pouring rain a few minutes prior to us charging, which I was told is the main culprit for this voltage spike fault.

Since then, we’ve had no issues with charging (knock on wood).",1585,True,1616133469.0,2021-03-19 06:57:49,1709,0,SeaEnergy,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/m8ac8v/130am_update_still_trapped_at_a_supercharger/grgbbix/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,grgbbix
comment,m8ac8v,m8ac8v,,"This will sound stupid but I didn’t see it happen in the video nor have I read all of the suggestions and in your other post I saw almost entirely only mentions of pulling on it as hard as you can so might I suggest pushing it back in? This is something I’ve seen happen before with even the mobile charger and wall connector as the latch can get stuck in the channel just like pins in a lock when attempting a lock pick (for lack of a better example). And again I am basing this purely off the video as it seems there is only outward force being applied to it so maybe you already do this and have done this for this case, BUT, I would suggest always lightly “jerking” the plug both in and out after and even a little before pressing the button. You can feel and hear the plug give a little as it slides in and out ever so slightly and hits the limits of the lock and the channel (which is another reason I am suggesting this is because I did not hear that in the video). This basically ensures that the channel is lined up and not pressed on the locking pin which is holding it in either by the angle it is pushing the locking pin or friction between the mechanism and the cable insert itself.

comment,m8ac8v,m8ac8v,,"Last Update for Now:

I got a call this morning around 11:30am from someone at Tesla Service. She had already seen this Reddit post, had read all of the updates, and had someone on their way to inspect the charging station.

I then dropped off the car this afternoon at the service center. Everyone there had seen this post as well and knew what was going on as soon as I arrived. They said they’re going to take a few days to run some tests, look at the error logs, and try to recreate the issue. Probably won’t have an update on that until early next week.

I should mention that I’m not upset with any individual for what happened. Every single Tesla employee I’ve spoken to has been professional and (I think) did everything they can to help resolve this. The larger concern I have is around the organization and staffing decisions. If the future is in electric cars, we need to know that they won’t leave us stranded somewhere for 15+ hours while we wait for support.

comment,kv41b2,kv41b2,,"Tesla's atmospheric energy harvesting ideas appear to be disclosed in the 1921 patent of Hermann Plauson. It says a large Tesla coil (like Tesla built at Colorado Springs, 40-100 m diameter) can harness power from thunderstorms, but to receive significant power, the coil needs to be huge (1-100 km diameter). Gernsback's artwork for Plauson's work depicted a coil made of powerline. Plauson also used magnesium aluminum alloy balloons covered with tiny spikes electropolished and coated with amalgamated zinc doped with thorium or polonium. He elevated these balloons as high as 3 km. It's possible there could be a nuclear reaction between the aluminum, magnesium, zinc, mercury, thorium/polonium, plasma and powerful electric fields that increases efficiency that was not disclosed. Here's the 1921 American patent. https://patents.google.com/patent/US1540998

In a 1922 editorial Gernsback wrote Plauson got 720 W (400 V, 1.8 A) with a single balloon at 300 yards (270 m) and 3.4 kW (500 V, 6.8 A) using two balloons. He said one hundred balloons, 100 yards apart, will generate at least 200 horsepower (150 KW), up to 400 during winter (300 KW). Plauson published a book about atmospheric energy harvesting in German, *Gewinnung und Verwertung der Atmosphatischen Elecktrizitat* (1922).

comment,kv41b2,kv41b2,,">Apparently Tesla wanted to combine atmospheric energy harvesting with wireless power transmission. His World Wireless System was intended to be a system of towers around the world for global wireless power transmission using very low frequency (4-12 kHz) surface waves.

We already have this in the form of VLF radio which, when you start getting into how it actually works, explains why Tesla's power transmission ideas wouldn't have worked. Even if you have an ideal surface wave you're still looking at 1/r attenuation. You can try this yourself even - set up a receiver for the VLF trasmitter SAQ in Grimeton at a distance of a 10-20 km, see what kind of power you get out of it. Bear in mind the antenna system has about 100 kW going into it, of which around 11% is actually radiated.

There are plenty of ways of harvesting energy at VLF frequencies and down. The problem is doing so economically. Like the idea of lofting wires using balloons which, when you run the numbers on it, shows you only get around 1 W out of a 1 km wire.",1039,False,1621247339.0,2021-05-17 12:28:59,2,0,fusion_curious,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/kv41b2/til_fbi_tasked_an_electrical_engineer_from_mit_dr/gyfh342/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,gyfh342
comment,kv41b2,kv41b2,,"Surface waves are not radio. Surface wave energy is conserved in the resonator. It is not radiated. Any radio waves produced are counted as a loss.

One form of Tesla's surface wave method was apparently disclosed in the 1918 patent of Charles Roe. It feeds dephased AC through two ground paths. https://patents.google.com/patent/US1333095

This wave transmission method may explain why Wardenclyffe had a huge and complex grounding system that Tesla said cost as much to construct as the tower itself.

edit: Daniel Watts Troy patented the single-path ground conductor version in 1903. https://patents.google.com/patent/US776876

The way these use resonance to eliminate resistance losses between the transmitter and receiver comes from Tesla's 1897 single-wire power transmission patent. https://patents.google.com/patent/US593138

edit: There is a wireless power patent using radio (unguided waves) that Tesla was probably involved with too. It was issued to August Kloneck in 1920. To use radio waves instead of surface wave conduction, the frequency it suggests is even lower, 15-200 Hz (1,500 km - 20,000 km). https://patents.google.com/patent/US1510624

comment,kv41b2,kv41b2,,">No, surface waves are not radio. Surface wave energy is conserved in the resonator. It is not radiated. Any radio waves produced are counted as a loss.

The words you're looking for are near-field and far-field. Even for 4 kHz the near field only extends to at most 150 km (2λ). Granted this is in free space. The surface wave near field could possibly extend a bit further, much like how you can have reactive components at the far end of a coaxial cable. But this isn't really what the patent is claiming in the end. More on that later.

There are people that experiment with VLF transmission, so-called LowFERs. Some use antenna systems quite similar to this patent. The key to getting them to work reasonably well is low ground conductance, but not so low that the resulting antenna impedance is impractically high. There's practical upper limit on impedance, around 2 kOhm if I remember correctly, where the necessary ratio between the wire separation and wire diameter become physically impossible to achieve. All this can be simulated with FEM software if you like. The amount of reactance you can have in L or C are likewise limited, for similar reasons. Stray capacitance limits how small C can be.

The way the patented system might actually work relies on differences in conductivity. Things must be arranged so that G1-G3 and G2-G4 have much higher conductivity than G1-G2 and G3-G4, and the patent gives examples like utilizing rivers and other geographical features.

Tesla turned to patenting fluidics in 1909 as his big gamble on Wardenclyffe fell through. His main fluidic invention was his bladeless turbine that he said he first conceived while working for Edison, which was 30 years before he patented it. It appears he had already sold or given that invention to others before he patented it himself.

Tesla used his turbine in an electrostatic generator to pump a gas or fluid charge carrier. Apparently Alfred W. Simon patented it in 1933. https://patents.google.com/patent/US2004352

Tesla's bladeless turbine also appeared as the propulsion mechanism of a flying machine patented in 1944, which appears to be Tesla's ""perfect flying machine"" that he said he would give to the League of Nations for peacekeeping purposes. Tesla also had sketches made of what looks like the same flying machine.

But you're mangling the details of his electromagnetic theory. Maxwell theorized the electromagnetic field (""ether"") must be incompressible, but Tesla disagreed. Tesla conceptualized the electromagnetic field as an ultrafine gas that only becomes more or less incompressible by electromagnetic forces acting upon it at the surface of conductors. He disagreed with the relativistic concept of considering space and time to be entities rather than metrics. He called the concept of space curvature illogical.

If anyone is interested I could post more about what Tesla called his ""dynamic theory of gravity"" and some contemporary work that appears to explain what he must have been talking about. I haven't posted it here before because it doesn't look particularly impressive. The contemporary work is all the work of one old engineer, and his papers are all self-published except for one peer-reviewed paper about the pattern of earth's stationary atmospheric electric field oscillations.

Instead of posting about it, here are links to it. It's interesting but weird. He built an ultraprecise electrometer and did a lot of simple experiments with it to reach very unconventional conclusions about gravity.

comment,nqs5v0,nqs5v0,,"On the highway, Autopilot depends more on the forward radar than the cameras. The radar is more accurate for detecting the range to other vehicles and it can ""see"" farther. The problem is that the radar attempts to filter out non-moving objects so that you're not stopping or swerving because of a discarded soda can or overhead sign. 

This is also the source of phantom braking. If we cull out too many non-moving objects, we hit parked emergency vehicles. If we cull out too few, we get phantom braking whenever a random piece of metal debris creates a radar reflection. This is a common problem for *every* auto manufacturer's radar-based TACC, not just Tesla's. Most of them solve it by removing *all* stopped-object radar returns and warn you (in the owner's manual) that it will not reliably detect stopped vehicles. They only activate the brakes when the obstacle is close enough to trigger Automatic Emergency Braking. 

Tesla is trying split the difference and develop a radar algorithm that can detect stopped obstacles yet ignore non-obstacle objects and debris. To do that, they often tweak the software to fine-tune exactly what kinds of radar returns are legitimate. That's why phantom braking seems to come and go depending on the software version.",1541,True,1622658353.0,2021-06-02 20:25:53,445,0,majesticjg,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/nqs5v0/autopilot_didnt_see_a_broken_down_truck_partially/h0cdt1d/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,h0cdt1d

I would have assumed that the cameras' contribution in a Tesla would help overcome that, but maybe you found an edge case where the truck looked too much like one of the rock features in the background for it to recognize it as a truck.  With the haze and color, it does blend in a little.

The only reason I see to buy USDT with usd is if you want to use an exchange that doesn't deal in fiat.

Say I bought 10$ worth of crypto and after the pump it is now worth 100$, before the dump I convert it to USDT (because I don't want to cash out , since I'm waiting for the next pump) , the concern here is whether the extra 90$ that came out of thin air is really backed by usd.

comment,pm19na,pm19na,,"This is a very short range wireless power system for electric trains. It might also be useful for electric vehicles today. Highways could charge your car without stopping or plugging anything in.

It was intended for powering multiple light railcars, which might mean 15-150 kW per vehicle with around a megawatt on a line. That would be enough to charge a lot of cars. It's also enough for power distribution, which means powered streets could replace overhead power lines in some places.

The line could reach higher voltage for the same insulation as an overhead line rather than underground, because air is more insulating than soil, but an overhead line carrying gigawatts of low frequency RF would probably expose people to excessive fields. It would be simpler with the line over the ground rather than in this underground conduit, but that would also expose people to stronger fields.

Tesla had a number of different wireless power ideas. This extremely short range induction power system was one of the first. He also had an idea to encircle a large area in a large 1-100 km diameter coil to supply the enclosed area with wireless power. Those two methods are two forms of induction.

comment,pjh26x,pjh26x,,"The short answer is ""No.""

But here's the more complicated answer: The statement ""possible efficiency"" is doing a lot of work when it comes to a Tesla turbine.

The rotor has been mathematically worked out to be capable of above 90% mechanical efficiency but thus far nobody has demonstrated the ability to solve the outlet losses on the design.

In reality there hasn't been any verifiable examples I've found of the unit much breaking 40% efficiency and this is not the kind of starting point where one wants to be when investing in making one with space-age materials.

Now be that as it may I think the Tesla turbine has some significant value. I think we should table the notion of the Tesla turbine as a super efficient machine and think of it as a mediocre one that has value due to its low cost/easy manufacture.

It belongs in places where robustness is key. I envision sufficiently large diameter Tesla turbines powering synchronous direct-drive generators running on air bearings powered by a run-of-river hydraulic air compressor (trompe).

While other turbine or pseudo-turbine designs would yield better overall outputs the benefit is that is the ability to make a cost-effective direct drive turbine that has no fuel costs, has no point of physical contact (air bearing) and doesn't need to be sharpened or filed down if left unattended.",3427,True,1631825083.0,2021-09-16 22:44:43,2,0,Cheebzsta,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/pjh26x/is_currently_possible_to_use_the_tesla_turbine_in/hd4j6n9/,True,,2021,both,top,False,False,0,hd4j6n9

You should always run the numbers yourself and with your financial planner to see it fit your needs and situation based on age, income, state, other factors, different investment objectives. 

Hell Yeah, put in $100/mo in a safer, simple, and stable S&P500(VOO) first . Keep it for life especially in a maxed out Roth IRA and, HSA. 

 Put an extra $100/mo in a 3X S&P500(UPRO) .  Wait up to 5 years to sell $2k-5k gains tax free( long term capital).  This protects your gains without a 15%-25% tax penalty.  Use the realized gain to buy more S&P500 (VOO) and keep it for a life. 

Investing 2.0 is used if you have extra income, want to support faster VOO growth, and can tax loss harvest. 

VOO 10% annualized returns is only meant as a hedge against 5% future inflation and small retirement. 


The underlining S&P500 index would need to lose 34% in one day to be instantly wiped out in UPRO. Highly unlikely with exchange safe guards and risk management.  UPRO is meant as a short term investing. 

No one is saying puting all money or sufficient amount in UPRO.  $100 or 10% is adequate risk and benefit for UPRO.  

Example #1. Investing 1.0. Put $100/mo in VOO for 30 years returns an  est. $228k.  After  inflation, adjusted purchasing power is $113k in 2051.

Example #2 Investing 2.0. Put $100/mo in UPRO , total return after 30 years is $1.56M, $753k purchasing power in 2051.",1931,True,1635551328.0,2021-10-30 01:48:48,2,0,Food4Lessy,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qi92fg/i_made_500000_trading_stocks_and_options_in_18/hikwiod/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,hikwiod

comment,qspovy,qspovy,,"This book is this random guy's uniquely unusual theories of radio propagation presented as his own Summers' theory of wireless. What makes it interesting is that the theories are Tesla's, and they're explained here in more detail than I've ever seen anywhere else. You can tell it's Tesla's by comparing it to Tesla's statements. The word choices used throughout the text are notably identical to Tesla's. It includes an explanation of Tesla's one-wire power transmission system with details that indicate the author had personal insight into Tesla's work. It mentions Tesla a few times, calling him the Father of Wireless.

If, like me, you have been looking for some key to decipher Tesla's seemingly confusing statements about radio that he never explained adequately, this appears to be it. 

Tesla said he visited Hertz in 1891 to explain an important error, but he never said exactly what it was. This book explains Hertz's error in a specific experiment and its implications for electrodynamics. To summarize, it says radio transmission takes place by two simultaneous processes. The first is air conduction, which it credits David Edward Hughes for discovering in 1879. Summers misspells Hughes. Hughes never published anything about it, but his findings created a sensation among European scientists. The second process, ground conduction, it notes is confined near the surface, which accurately describes surface wave propagation.",4926,True,1636769221.0,2021-11-13 03:07:01,2,0,dalkon,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/qspovy/revolutionary_theories_in_wireless_1920_frank/hkeqx0s/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,hkeqx0s

They are a popular type of pump today in specific applications, but as far as I've seen, the companies that make them never acknowledge Tesla in any way. 

Tesla wanted to use them for a type of fan jet engine for his flying machines, which he described in minimal detail in his flying machine patents. Tesla's flying machine concept was advanced further after his death by someone who looks like he probably got info from Tesla. I could post about that some time if anyone is interested. 

A Tesla turbine can also be used as a turbomolecular vacuum pump. Tesla patented that idea in 1921 only in the UK. [GB179043](https://patents.google.com/patent/GB179043)

Someone patented a silent Tesla turbine fan that uses a rotor made of stiff fabric disks or other odd materials such as sand paper. 

A Tesla turbine can also be adapted for nautical propulsion especially with a pair of counterrotating rotors.

Tesla said his cryogenic resonant transformer allowed him to attain much more powerful currents than he could before. He patented his cryogenic resonator a decade before Heike Kamerlingh Onnes discovered superconductivity in 1911.

Looking at his electronic inventions Plauson obviously worked with Tesla. Besides Tesla's idea of atmospheric energy harvesting, Plauson also patented the resonant induction motor, the underlying principle of which Tesla had first demonstrated in 1892. Tesla demonstrated the principle but never explained how to make practical use of it, and neither did anyone else until Plauson patented it in 1919. Plauson also included the idea for citywide wireless power in his patent. The coil around a city for energy harvesting would also provide wireless power transmission with very high transmission efficiency. Induction is normally only thought of as a very short range transmission method, but everywhere within a huge coil, the transmission distance is zero, so induction is very efficient. There's a lot more they have in common too if you look.

comment,qspovy,qspovy,,"**26—Work of Hertz.** It was about the year 1888 when a German physicist, Heinrich Hertz, made some experiments that were of untold value to science by confirming in an experimental way the theories of Maxwell, that wireless waves and light were similar. While he thought these wireless waves, when detected at a distance from an induction coil was by electromagnetic induction alone. Science quickly accepted this theory and here was the beginning of the system of electro-static oscillations as used today for the transmission and reception of intelligence around the world. Prof. Hertz used a coil of wire, and when placed in a conductor of strong invisible electric currents, enough electricity was conducted to the coil to produce a visible spark when the two ends of the coil were close together. When this coil was close to the spark gap of the induction coil electro-static and magnetic induction was no doubt the cause of part of the current in the Hertz coil. But the air acting as a conductor for the invisible electric waves was by far the greater and dominating cause. But this electro-static and magnetic field only exist a very short distance from the induction coil of wireless transmitting station and the electro-static currents travelling by conduction through the air are the sole cause of our wireless detectors responding to same. The electro-static and magnetic field quickly dies out.

comment,r93ixi,r93ixi,,"I've never heard that. I'm curious where you did. It is an interesting idea. 

A Chicago inventor, Albert G Whitney proposed building a railway around the equator with the trains pulled by tethered satellites. That was probably Tesla's idea or influenced by him. Of course that's probably not practical, but it's still an interesting idea. A coil around the equator could be used to receive current. 

The atmosphere already does absorb electromagnetic energy from space. The process could be manipulated for energy harvesting or to modify the atmosphere. The magnetosphere is made out of huge plasma tubes spanning north to south that rotate by the energy they receive from space. 

The most immediate use for modifying the atmosphere would be to address global warming. The heat of the atmosphere is a function of the pressure of positive ions, which means efficient means to neutralize positive charge could be used to cool the atmosphere. For example, fountains could be used as neutralizer-ionizers to allay urban heat islands. 

Electrostatic atmospheric manipulation is probably complicated by the solar wind. Plasma conductors thru the troposphere would heat the atmosphere by drawing positive ions in. It might be necessary to confine positive charge outside the troposphere to control the charge within it without interfering with the field above.

comment,sf20o4,sf20o4,,"I've seen this interview before. It's remarkably dull for how interesting what they're talking about should be. 

Stan Deyo, the interviewer who made that documentary, applied for a patent for an energy harvesting device in 2007. He said it's a version of Tesla's system. It appears to be Tesla's radiant energy concept. It uses high voltage on an aerial unipolar capacitance with a simple resonant circuit to harness electrostatic wave energy particularly 4.5-7 MHz, which is produced by random pressure waves propagated in the troposphere by the impacts of the solar wind and cosmic particles with the ionosphere. He cites Trump's research to describe how it works in the patent, which makes it seem like he got the idea from him.  https://patents.google.com/patent/US20080191580A1

edit: I found Stan Deyo has a YouTube channel where he has this documentary including this interview in better quality. https://youtu.be/KLJMQn4cZPs?t=1524

His first video he uploaded there says what he learned from Dr. Trump during this interview, which is the idea he applied to patent. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwxNTGpM1cQ

I'd seen his patent before, but I didn't think there was much to it because it's brief and more importantly I thought the frequency of the ambient energy must be lower. If there is much energy in the HF band (43-67 m), I reasoned someone would have noticed because radios operate in that range. Looking at it again now has made me reconsider.

Tesla said a lot of very interesting things about physics and metaphysics, like about the nature of energy, radiation, cosmology, gravity, quantum mechanics, etc. but it's remarkably difficult to find any real information about that on the internet. It is available to read and attempt to interpret, but if you're interested in learning more about his thoughts, you're inundated by thousands of links about this numerology stuff that doesn't actually seem to be connected to Tesla at all. It almost seems like the point of it is to suppress interest in Tesla and consideration of the things he really did say.

One useful thing about this is that it makes it easy to identify people who actually care about the information enough to know this is not correctly attributed to Tesla.

comment,uvmhig,uvmhig,,"This is the best biography of Tesla's youth I've ever read. It provides considerable detail about events in Tesla's early life that he mentioned in his autobiography. It reads like an addendum to Tesla's autobiography that fills in the details. 

For instance it explains why as a child he became determined to become a genius before he knew what the word meant and pushed himself so forcefully to that goal. It says what he was doing when he got trapped in the abandoned church and how he was rescued. It says Tesla was so mad at Edison for lying about the promised bonus of $50,000 that he didn't tell anyone he quit. He just walked out without saying anything to anyone and never came back.

Unfortunately the author seems to lose track of everything Tesla did after around 1894-1900. It's clearly wrong about many things after the period it covers well. For instance it says Tesla and JP Morgan were good friends throughout their lives and that Morgan gave Tesla the money for Wardenclyffe without any conditions, but we know that's not true. Tesla sold Morgan the controlling stake in his wireless tech for the $150k he got for Wardenclyffe, which was only half the cost of constructing it. And then Morgan refused to sell it back to Tesla when Tesla subsequently wanted to work with other investors who actually wanted to see it work.

From “MY INVENTIONS V - THE MAGNIFYING TRANSMITTER”

“The tower was destroyed two years ago but my projects are being developed and another one, improved in some features, will be constructed. On this occasion I would contradict the widely circulated report that the structure was demolished by the Government which owing to war conditions, might have created prejudice in the minds of those who may not know that the papers, which thirty years ago conferred upon me the honor of American citizenship, are always kept in a safe, while my orders, diplomas, degrees, gold medals and other distinctions are packed away in old trunks. If this report had a foundation I would have been refunded a large sum of money which I expended in the construction of the tower.

comment,uvmhig,uvmhig,,"Thank you for the kind words and also pointing that out. 

That doesn't mean it's true either. That only means Tesla said it was true too. Tesla was apparently always much nicer to Morgan than he ever had any known reason to be. All that means is Tesla never wanted the public appearance of not getting along with Morgan. 

I don't believe the nice things Tesla said about Morgan are true, but that is another way that this book agrees with everything Tesla said to such an extent it seems like it could have been written by Tesla. It's possible Tesla wrote this book or most of it. Maybe he intended for it to be published for his centennial in 1956, but Beckhard didn't manage to get through editing and publishing in time for that. 

Despite the nice things Tesla said about Morgan publicly, the truth was finally revealed when the Tesla Museum released his telegrams. That's how we know Tesla was lying by saying his relationship with Morgan was always good. We can only speculate why—most likely out of misplaced hope Morgan would return the kindness. 

It's also worth noting Morgan was the money behind Edison and Marconi and everyone else who ever wronged Tesla and Westinghouse. And most importantly, Morgan intentionally stymied Wardenclyffe and Tesla's wireless power plans and stole the invention of radio from him for Marconi. Morgan gave Tesla every reason to hate him.

I mean, not really. Delaware Chancery Court is going to force him to go through with the sale at the $54.20 price specifically for all of the reasons you just said. Elon has *every financial incentive* not to do what he's doing, but he's got an addictive personality and, right now, he's addicted to shitposting.

He's going to instantly lose billions of dollars by spending $44B on a company that's worth, at most, about $20–30B. Not only that, but as his debt financing expires, he may be compelled to sell huge quantities of TSLA shares at a significant discount just to complete the purchase. 

On top of the billions he's going to lose in the sale, the SEC is also likely to fine him a giant amount of money or ban him from serving as an officer of any publicly traded company.

Elon's sitting comfortably in the ""fuck around"" phase right now, but the ""find out"" phase is coming. He can save face by following through on the $54.20 deal without forcing it through court.

comment,v1itrt,v1itrt,,"I’m the opposite of a Tesla fanboy, but what large NYSE listed car manufacturers aren’t down significantly? Ford is down 50%, GM 40%, and even Toyota and Ferrari have been down close to 30%.

Tesla gets the headlines because of its overall valuation, but on percentage terms, it’s only down marginally higher than other large car stocks.

Having said that, investors priced Tesla at its peak like it’s the Apple of car stocks. The car industry is vastly different, and I’m of the opinion that the new Toyota EV (the Toyota BZ4X) is going to fly off the shelves. Not because it’s the best EV or has the best performance figures, but because Toyota has some of the most loyal customers in the world. It’s perceived as the most reliable and trustworthy brand, and it’s why the Corolla and RAV4 are the two highest selling cars by volume in the world. The Corolla isn’t the best car in its class, but everyone that buys it knows what they’re getting (reliability, ease of use, build quality, resale value, good capped priced servicing etc).

Tesla don’t even make the best EV in the world. The best EV according to various 2021 car of the year awards is the Kia EV6.

comment,vn01fj,vn01fj,,"This patent describes simple apparatus that consists of a Tesla lightning protector positioned over a spark gap that is used to collect atmospheric energy. A Tesla lightning protector is an ultra high voltage terminal. The spark discharge is used as an antenna to collect both atmospheric charge and ambient thermal energy. The author says the electric thermal energy of the atmosphere is much greater than the energy of atmospheric electric charge. 

Among other inventors Hermann Plauson and Ewald Rasch patented similar concepts in 1920. Rasch used an arc discharge from a kite: [GB179967](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/010335657/publication/GB179967A?q=pn%3DGB179967A). Plauson used radioactive metal balloons flying over spark gaps hanging beneath the balloons and also at ground level: [US1540998](https://www.google.com/patent/US1540998). Apparently they also explained this same electric thermal energy concept, but their explanations were not as clear. Serafino Orlando explained the thermal energy more clearly in 1924: [GB231247](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/009699504/publication/GB231247A?q=pn%3DGB231247A). 

This patent explains the conventional Wilson thunderstorm theory of atmospheric charge (1920) is wrong. It says the thermal electric energy of the atmosphere is the real cause of atmospheric charge. 

It draws this thermal electric energy from the atmosphere by imitating the process of thunderstorms.",3630,True,1656458222.0,2022-06-29 01:17:02,5,0,dalkon,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/vn01fj/active_antenna_to_collect_atmospheric_electricity/ie4a7nq/,True,,2022,tesla,top,False,False,0,ie4a7nq

comment,ws330d,ws330d,,"Al Hubbard was not known to be a protege of Tesla, but he must have been because he invented something Tesla had invented, a nuclear reactor so simple that it doesn't appear to be a nuclear reactor. It was a more advanced form of the same reactor first patented in 1896 by Tesla protege Nathan Stubblefield. 

This type of reactor is so simple that it's not much more than an electromagnet or array of electromagnets. It is a type of breeder reactor that requires only a tiny amount of highly radioactive material. Most of the material it uses is unenriched thorium and uranium crude ore. The small amount of enriched material may be as little as 50-100 mg of radium, enriched uranium, polonium, radon or pretty much any alpha emitter. Radon has the advantage of being an abundant byproduct of nuclear energy production and nuclear waste storage. As a gas it is unwieldy, but it could be used in a permanently sealed ampoule. 

Apparently Stubblefield's patent prevented Hubbard from obtaining a patent for his version of it. The Pittsburgh-based Radium Corporation of America bought the rights to Hubbard's invention and shelved it. That was the fate of all of Tesla's most powerful inventions. 

Tesla mentioned he discovered atomic radiation before anyone else a number of times, but he never tried to take credit for the true extent of his contributions. Tesla was the unsung true father of nuclear physics.

comment,x94ecz,x94ecz,,"Hello, Dr. Seifer. I hope you have a good response to your AMA.

I think Tesla occupies a unique position in the mind of America. I have not yet read your book, but as an example, let me site Spider Robinson, the Canadian author of the Callahan Cross-Time Saloon novels. In Callahan's Key, Tesla plays a pivotal role and he's a fantastical character with mastery over electrical knowledge that mere mortals cannot fathom.

My question: how do you think your book will address the popular idea that Tesla was, for lack of a better term, a wizard - considering that you actually named one of your books about him ""Wizard at War""?",627,False,1662657110.0,2022-09-08 19:11:50,7,0,[deleted],Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/x94ecz/im_marc_j_seifer_noted_biographer_of_tesla_who/inm29jt/,True,,2022,tesla,hot,False,False,0,inm29jt

comment,x94ecz,x94ecz,,"Tesla was the quintessential wizard, and that is why I named the first book WIZARD: THE LIFE & TIMES OF Nikola Tesla. That book was released in 1996 and is still often a #1 book on Amazon. When Hollywood called me to star in the 5-part limited series THE TESLA FILES, I went back to my records and found new recently de-classified documents from the FBI, CIA, OSS and also from, unbelievably, the Soviet Union! and so I honed in on what happened to Teslas secret weaponry papers. And I found to my astonishment that Tesla was actually negotiating with Joseph Stalin himself! and that FDR himself when he was president was trying to meet with Tesla at the height of WWII, so we now had to come up with a title for the new book and because he was the ""w"" word, we wanted to keep it in the title and that's how I came up with TESLA: WIZARD AT WAR.",844,False,1662657955.0,2022-09-08 19:25:55,11,0,Marc-Seifer,Tesla,https://reddit.com/r/Tesla/comments/x94ecz/im_marc_j_seifer_noted_biographer_of_tesla_who/inm4ibe/,True,,2022,tesla,hot,False,False,0,inm4ibe
comment,x94ecz,x94ecz,,"Tesla was a Serb and to understand the Serbian people we need to know and appreciate what is known as the Battle of Kosovo which took place in 1389 (over 600 years ago!).  The Ottoman Empire were a brutal bellicose group who would slay the men, put their heads on stakes, rape the women and convert the children to their way of life. The Ottoman Empire was about to invade the whole of Europe, but to get there, they had to go through Serbia, and as Tesla states, ""Europe can never repay the great debt it owes the Serbians for checking, by the sacrifice of its own liberty, that barbarian influx."" 30,000 Turks died but the Serbs had comparable losses and their great kingdom which had a benevolent king, was destroyed in the process. According to Professor Markovitch who attended one of my lectures, ""It follows us always."" So every Serb knows that their utopian past was shattered on that day. Thus, Tesla set out to try and figure out a way to end all wars. However, for him to do this, he thought if he could come up with a truly horrible weapon, then no nation would be stupid enough to go to war, so he invented drone warfare through a remote controlled torpedo in 1898 during the Spanish American War and then the particle beam weapon, which was also called the death ray in the run-up to World War II. Tesla also billed this weapon as a ""peace ray,"" for that reason. If every nation had a perfect means of defense, war would end.

To keep up with the previous like-minded answers & posts: Not only about the man who in fact was/are a greater mind, going back to the likes of Galllileo and such genius who cannot afford to become more of the outside world, since, what we are told in tender ages o f6 or 7 years  old to the age of your near 20 year old. If you have been believing everything that your teachers & world around has forced you to be is true and so many. You can fall through every solid form or any sign of believing that what other people are saying is true. I guess that is why we live in a world,  robbed of all the things of greater good, without Nikola Tesla wireless world wide free sources of electricity and in a world where oil, gas and the next mass extinction is expected either by nuclear holocaust, weather, or the most likely: a W.W No 3, since fresh water will not dry out on land of Australia size in my lifetime and I'm born in the 80's.

Chappelle responds: “It sounds like some of those people you fired are in the audience.”

Later in the video, Chappelle says: “All these people that are booing, I’m just pointing out the obvious — they have terrible seats in the stadium.” (minimum ticket price here was ~300$ btw)

Edison, an ardent proponent of DC, held initial sway due to his established reputation.

When Westinghouse, a shrewd industrialist, threw his resources behind Tesla's AC system, the tide began to turn.  
  
Westinghouse's win symbolizes a timeless lesson - superior technology often prevails, but not without the right support and resources.

I added 5% more at the restaurant and arrived in Gallup with 10% just about where ABRP predicted and 20% less than the NAV predicted.

Crafted with precision, the prototype boasts a robust design featuring an aluminum disc stack enclosed in a high-quality polycarbonate casing.      

The turbine is tailored to accommodate a variety of testing conditions, though currently optimized for compressed air tests.      

From initial trials, the turbine has shown promising potential, generating 1200 watts of power on a Dyno test with 30-40psi and a notable 250 watts electrical load when partnered with an upgrade generator package) on just 15psi of compressed air.  

It is also designed for future upgradeability, with provisions to accommodate a 2-stage upgrade we aim to release soon.      

While this turbine is a working prototype, it’s not a complete, turnkey solution or operational turbine. 

So, what’s the purpose of this unit?      

We’ve designed and are selling this prototype to provide a hands-on, engaging, and informative tool for those interested in our renewable energy systems, and specifically in Tesla turbine technology.

comment,1b9rxzh,1b9rxzh,,"So, I'm going to be honest, this actually looks remarkably like what's shown on the [website](https://shop.tesla.com/product/cybertruck-basecamp)

I understand what their ""concept drawing"" shows, but when you look at the website, and you look at the customer images, it's basically the same thing.

Only real difference is that the outer ""rain slick"", or whatever you want to call it, appears to be darker in the customer images, and ""looser"", but that might be attributed to the fact that they put it together in the rain and don't have it all secured and such.

I feel like people are judging based off of the *concept* drawing, and not what's actually being sold through the website...

The Caliber study relates specifically to corporate reputation, where Tesla dropped by almost 30 pts in its “Trust & Like” and “Consideration” indexes over the last two years, which measure peoples’ opinion of a brand and if they’d consider buying their product.

They don’t appear to draw a direct line to Musk’s behavior, unclear if there’s a question in their survey directly about that, but it would be a pretty strange thing to have asked *before* Musk started having a higher profile and revealed his controversial political alignment. I also seriously doubt they’d have questions about any other auto executives — could you even name the president of Honda America?

Instead Caliber threads the needle by pointing out their survey does show that 83% of adults know who Musk is and that he runs Tesla.

Not an entirely unreasonable conclusion to jump to, but I’d still rate this a bad use of data.

Personally I would not consider a Tesla because I think they’re generally very good computers wrapped in a very mediocre car.

It shocks me how negative the tone is here about FSD. I live in Los Angeles where city driving can be hectic and the latest FSD v12 is a game changer.

It makes the right decisions (and drives better than I do) 99% of the time. The 1% of the time it makes the wrong decisions are usually very obvious beforehand and it's easy for me to disengage, quickly make the right decision, and fire FSD right back up.

I use it almost exclusively for every drive now and will never drive another car that doesn't offer it. Even despite monitoring the road the entire time, I am no longer making thousands of brain-fatiguing micro decisions every time I'm in the driver's seat and driving is such a pleasure.

It had a few hiccups, but it was a LOT better than I thought it would be. The few times I had to intervene were mostly because I wasn't comfortable with the situation. For example, I didn't like that it didn't seem to pay attention to semi's blind spots, and would just cruise right beside them. My longest trips was 140 miles on a not-so-busy highway and it was nearly perfect. I didn't intervene one time.

For the amount of miles my wife drives, $99 is too much for me. However, if I was going on a long road trip and planned on using a lot in a month, I would pay $99. I think for our amount of usage, $30 would be about right.

  
Everyone I know that tried it a lot, was really impressed. There were a few things that people complained about like accelerating fast at lights, which is more of a preference thing, which I actually enjoyed.

It made me hate AutoPilot even more. There is zero reason that I shouldn't be able to switch lanes without interrupting the cruise control.

I used FSD and the trial reaffirmed that I will never pay for FSD unless it's $2,000 or less. To me FSD still drives too slow and skittish especially at irregular stop signs or intersections. Also city / back roads the constant changing of speed limits puts you back to the speed limit, if I'm not doing 10mph over on the city streets I'll have traffic piling up my ass behind me. Also when the speed limit goes from 35 to 45mph, most human drivers are doing 50-55mph by the time you hit the 45mph sign, so people would ride up my ass and I'd manually have to speed up early.

Tesla wasn't on the list, but as we looked at the price of some relatively new, but un-excitinge ICE cars, we started looking at used Teslas as an option. I have a Rivian R1T (was one of the first in my area, about 1.5 years ago) and love it, but my wife was skeptical of EVs.  Eventually we found a great deal on a 2017 90D S with 40k miles, that was priced well below anything we thought was realistic. We decided (on a whim) to check it out. My wife absolutely fell in love with the car (It was in almost perfect condition, minus some paint chips on the front hood). We bought it, and after we drove away, I realized that the original owner had upgraded the computers and it had FSD. As an software engineer (and someone who has a Rivian), I was always skeptical of FSD...But I find it absolutely mind blowing....We have to tell our kids that it doesn't have it and if they try to enable it, it enables  a subscription and we will be charged (so they don't try)...

We talk for a few minutes as I wait for my next ride request. His wife comes walking out and the guy excitedly recounts his FSD experience. He offered me $100 cash if I could take them for a spin around the corner quick so the wife could experience it.

comment,1g7hhm8,1g7hhm8,,"I think it’s really easy for nuance and details to get lost over text, which is part of why I don’t like everything being handled through the app. There’s a convenience factor for sure, but being there in person with a service advisor (ideally the same one each time) who can physically see the issue and keep track of things is a much better approach for situations like OP’s. 

Tesla’s advisors, from what I can tell, work from a queue and it’s often not the same person you’re interacting with from message to message or day to day (mainly in the app). I also imagine they have time-to-response metrics they’re held to in some way, so it’s super easy for context to get lost when you’re unfamiliar with the situation and jump into the message thread without reading all of the past service history and notes. 

It’s pretty inexcusable for a company of Tesla’s size to handle things this way, especially when dealing with more complex situations. It’s one thing to handle a simple tire rotation like this, but when dealing with a (fairly) complex warranty issue, there are just too opportunities for details to get lost over text. 

I’d agree that showing up in person is the way to go. I’ve always had good experiences with Tesla’s service advisors in person; so if OP has one near by, showing up in person and calmly explaining the situation would be the best place to start. 

I’d avoid mentioning a lawyer to anyone.

comment,1hpsc0u,1hpsc0u,,"Plutocrats like Elon Musk (not a U.S. Service Veteran) want cheap labor they can exploit. Contrary to the ""DOGE"" narrative, the fact is there is currently an oversupply of high-quality domestic tech labor as the U.S. has experienced [major technology layoffs in 2024](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/tech-news/the-state-of-tech-layoffs-in-2024-a-closer-look-at-major-cuts-and-industry-trends#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20the%20tech%20industry%20will%20undergo%20massive,these%20cuts%2C%20as%20are%20hundreds%20of%20smaller%20startups.).

The H-1B visa gives an employer complete control over the employee. If the employee loses the job, they lose their visa and are sent back to their home country. This is why the plutocrats want the H-1B visas. In the program employees can be coerced into working 100-hour weeks for below average pay.

Tellingly, Elon Musk runs Tesla as a nonunion shop in the United States. Musk also has ongoing well-publicized disputes with the unions in Germany and Sweden. Musk's just a less interesting version of the 19th century robber barons who hired Pinkertons to fire upon the rank-and-file.

1) the median age of vehicles on the road in the US is over 12 years. Half of then are therefore pretty close to several decades old and in various states of repair.

2) accident rate increases with the age of the vehicle. Older vehicles are therefore over-represented in calls for service by first responders.

3) Older vehicles on average are less safe before you even factor in any age related degradation.


The result is something of a bias that doesn't necessarily reflect the reality of cars built in the last few years. The Model Y has a very strong roof structure. Ioniq 5's roof strength tested within 5% of the Y. Both are demonstrably very safe vehicles.

There is an impact of vehicle geometry to consider though as well. Ioniq 5 has a much closer to vertical rear gate/window which may have resulted in more of a rear collision rather than one that skidded up the Y and landed on the roof. That could be no big deal or it could be worse. There's not really a way for us to know. Oddly enough IIHS does not do any rear impact testing.

Tldr; Modern cars, especially EVs, are all quite safe. Different cars behave differently though so there's no way to really know which is better for a specific accident.",1255,False,1735653908.0,2024-12-31 15:05:08,13,0,zackplanet42,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1hq6gib/the_glass_roof_is_no_joke_a_truck_rear_ended_a/m4oy7xs/,True,,2024,tesla,top,False,False,0,m4oy7xs

Chargers shouldn't need reviews. They should just work. There should be a reporting function that informs the charge vendor it's offline and that's about it.

What do you think it takes to get a fab running? A couple years, concrete, some low skill workers, and the requisite machines manufactured by ASML in the Netherlands? You would be thoroughly wrong if you said yes to that second question. First, just designing the building needs to take into account the need for near perfect operating conditions for the clean rooms and the other various environments necessary to produce chips from silicon wafers. If expedited, this could destroy entire batches of chips due to mild changes in weather or seismic activity, if not bring down the entire facility for an extended period of time. So that work needs to be perfect. You will note a running theme here that every single aspect of these facilities need to be effectively perfect for them to work. They are producing incredibly complex structures on the order of NANOMETERS. That requires unfathomable precision, which in turn requires eternally, completely stable operating conditions. Taking into account American sign-off processes from a bureaucratic standpoint, and the fact that American construction routinely cuts corners, TSMC would need to constantly oversee their entire building process and additionally lube the gears of the federal and local government to make this process work.",4501,True,1738073186.0,2025-01-28 15:06:26,27,0,homelessness_is_evil,investing,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ic0kp2/trump_announces_chip_tariffs_up_to_100/m9my7gb/,True,,2025,tesla,top,False,False,0,m9my7gb

They are completely different cars. The P3 is more comparable to a Model X, BMW iX, or MB EQE (my opinion). It is dead silent in the cabin, solid, the B&W sound system is ridiculous (and I thought the MY was the best I’d ever had in a car). The adjustable air suspension and real torque vectoring make it handle beautifully. Fit and finish is better. 

Polestar is based in, designed, and engineered Sweden with obvious sharing with Volvo. Geely is their largest investor but from my understanding it is not involved in the day to day operations. They own Lotus as well. The car is built in South Carolina.

comment,1j5z8gn,1j5z8gn,,"More than 200 auto dealers across the country were “stiffed” when Tesla “had a run on the bank,” claiming tens of millions of dollars in EV rebates on the last weekend before the government abruptly shut down the public subsidy program in January.

Now these independently owned dealerships are out of pocket an estimated $10 million, having provided 2,295 rebates to customers and expecting to get reimbursed, according to the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association (CADA).

“These dealers in good faith gave customers the money for a program that is always refunded,” said CADA spokesperson Huw Williams. “They shouldn’t be left making a payment on behalf of the Government of Canada.”

The iZEV EV rebate program offered from $2,500 to $5,000 toward the purchase of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. Dealerships provided the rebate to buyers upfront and expected to be reimbursed by the government.

On Jan. 10, as political turmoil embroiled the federal government, Transport Canada informed dealerships that the EV rebate program would run out of money before its scheduled end in March.

“Due to the high uptake, the iZEV Program will be paused in a few weeks,” stated the email sent to dealerships just before noon on the Friday, obtained by the Star.

But that weekend there was an unprecedented surge in claims from four Tesla outlets, the Star revealed this week. The four Tesla showrooms claimed 8,653 EV sales in 72 hours and filed for $43.",3552,True,1741383519.0,2025-03-07 22:38:39,548,0,FourteenthCylon,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j5z8gn/suspicious_tesla_sales_surge_triggers_canadian/mgkxj49/,True,,2025,both,top,False,False,0,mgkxj49
comment,1j5z8gn,1j5z8gn,,"CADA surveyed its 3,500 dealer members to determine how many rebated EVs were sold that didn’t get inputted into the system before the federal government shut it down. Their numbers, which have not been made public, show 226 dealerships provided rebates on 2,295 electric vehicles and have not been reimbursed. This would total more than $10 million, if the breakdown of battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles mirrored all the rebates given out since 2019. 

Williams said one dealership is out of pocket $690,000. The Star spoke with two dealers in Quebec; both pointed out that most Quebec auto dealers are closed on the weekend and therefore were not only unable to sell EVs during the last weekend the rebate program was open, but also weren’t able to file paperwork when they returned to work on the Monday. One of the dealers said he was out $300,000. The other said he had fronted $410,000, and is considering layoffs because of the financial squeeze. 

Terry Budd, who owns eight car dealerships in the Oakville and Hamilton areas, said there was no notice from the government that the iZEV program was coming to an end. Instead, he received an email from CADA informing him the program was running short on funds and advising him to tell his salespeople and customers.

While they hurried to get as many rebates submitted as possible over the weekend, more than a month later, they still haven’t been paid for the 35 EVs and hybrids they sold that weekend.",1961,True,1741383539.0,2025-03-07 22:38:59,181,0,FourteenthCylon,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j5z8gn/suspicious_tesla_sales_surge_triggers_canadian/mgkxlhe/,True,,2025,tesla,top,False,False,0,mgkxlhe

comment,1j9jxzj,1j9jxzj,,"So there's two aspects to this:

The first is that all companies are run by people, and it's a completely natural and right that the people in charge of other EV companies would be horrified by Musk and his antics. The proper human response to nascent fascism is revulsion and opposition.

The second though is that companies get anthromorphized by consumers/audiences so that people see communications from that company (like ads and brand-managed social media posts) as coming from a *person*, rather than a company. People can have very personal responses to this - and interestingly, there is a large segment of the human population that is conflict-adverse over all else. Getting involved in a fight, *even if the cause is righteous* is seen as being ""just as bad"" as fighting for an evil cause. It is the *fight* that is wrong, irrespective of the root cause of the fight.

comment,1jdbe40,1jdbe40,,"To preface. The last 5 years, I've owned 4 Teslas -- Model 3 SR+, M3 LR, MYP, MYP. I'll be brief, I believe they are good products and I made this decision because I believe it now stands for the wrong thing. Hope my Tesla goes to someone else instead of them buying new. Better to act on your convictions than to not act at all.

I considered the Ioniq 5, EV9, F150 Lightning, Polestar 3, Mach E, Mercedes EQS.

I was looking for something similar to Tesla. I mainly wanted the regen and software to be similar. And from a Tesla owners perspective, the Rivian is very similar, which is great! The regen is even stronger and adjustable.

Some of the other EVs DEFAULT to no regen or low regen. And they never remember your regen settings when you get in, you have to hit the paddles every time! I'm looking at you Kia and Hyundai!

I was not a fan of the software for the F150, Mach E or Mercedes. The layout of the Rivian infotainment is akin to modern tablet OS and has a native spotify app like Tesla. I can even google cast to it, which could arguably be easier than the native youtube app on Tesla. I can cast crunchyroll animes!

And to close this out. It's faster, SOFTER suspension, more versatile, and more luxurious inside.

The Riviain just feels more well built and premium. The automatic frunk is really a game changer too. The Tesla charging network is obviously a big plus for Tesla (although I can use my Rivian at most). The autopilot is also eons better in the Tesla and I'm actually surprised at how poor it is on my Rivian (my wife's Toyota's is actually better).

comment,1je8ms2,1je8ms2,,"“Tesla investors are having another rocky day, with shares down as much as 7%.

The stock is headed for an ninth-straight weekly loss, and now sits 53% below the all-time highs reached in mid-December.

As each day passes, the list of headwinds facing the EV maker seems to grow. In addition to existing pressures, Tesla on Tuesday faced fresh competition from China and an analyst price-target cut.

Below are four forces — two new, two evergreen — driving the acceleration in Tesla’s share-price decline.

1. BYD’s new battery tech

The Chinese firm BYD unveiled an EV-charging station that it claims can deliver up to 400 kilometers driving range after just five minutes of charging. This would be a big step up from current charging technology, with Tesla’s quickest version providing a 275-kilometer range after 15 minutes of charging.

The development creates another headwind for Tesla as it tries to break into Chinese market.

BYD plans to build 4,000 of these chargers across China.

2. Wall Street scaling back forecasts

Though RBC maintains an “outperform” rating on Tesla, it cut its price target to $320 from $440.

The analyst Tom Narayan expects lower pricing on Tesla’s full self-driving technology as autonomous offerings become increasingly standard across the EV industry. Meanwhile, given heightened competition in Europe and China, Narayan lowered robotaxi-penetration assumptions.",3126,True,1742315284.0,2025-03-18 17:28:04,85,0,TheWelshleyArms,business,https://reddit.com/r/business/comments/1je8ms2/4_reasons_why_teslas_53_stock_crash_is/migliis/,True,,2025,both,top,False,False,0,migliis

Ford sold 33,510 lightnings in 2024 or 8,377 a quarter. Add 2022 (15.6k) and 2023 (24k) sales and about 73k lightnings have been sold on an upward trend.

TL;DR: There are more R1 vehicles than cybertrucks but more cybertrucks than R1Ts. Lightnings appear to generally be the best selling EV truck. Cybertrucks briefly outsold everyone, peaking at a rate of 15k a quarter for at least a month but that seems to have ended.

ETA: using the 1:3 ratio of R1S:R1T from the report linked by SPorterBridges, that's roughly 31k R1Ts, probably the 46k cybertrucks from the recall and. 73k lightnings, and 126k total R1 vehicles.

comment,1jk95cu,1jk95cu,,"From the article: The Canadian government has frozen $43 million in electric vehicle (EV) rebate payments owed to Tesla and declared the automaker ineligible for all future iZEV (Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles) programs, citing a combination of trade tensions and concerns over potential misuse of the program.

The decision was confirmed by Chrystia Freeland, who was recently appointed as Transport Minister. According to Freeland, the freeze was ordered before the election was called, and payments will remain suspended until every claim submitted by Tesla is reviewed individually.

“No payments will be made until we are confident that the claims are valid,” said Freeland in a statement to the Tornoto Star. “I also directed my department to change the eligibility criteria for future iZEV programs to ensure that Tesla vehicles will not be eligible for incentives so long as the illegitimate and illegal U.S. tariffs are imposed against Canada.”

The move comes in response to a last-minute surge in rebate claims submitted by Tesla in the final days of the iZEV program. According to government data, Tesla filed thousands of claims in just 72 hours that exhausted the remaining funds in the program nearly overnight. While many are claiming Tesla abused the program, the more likely scenario is that Tesla rushed to file claims for cars it had already sold, but not yet sought the rebate.",1760,True,1742987213.0,2025-03-26 12:06:53,67,0,chrisdh79,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1jk95cu/canada_freezes_43_million_in_tesla_ev_kickbacks/mjtb0bc/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mjtb0bc

Tesla is not a traditional dealership, in that they operate their own stores.  This could be something as simple as ""Tesla had a paperwork backlog and funneled everything through this one store"" or it can be Tesla straight up abusing the rebate system.

The reality is that no one knows what happened, just that it did, and every time another province excludes Tesla, they bring up this story as an ""explanation"" of ""one of the reasons"" why this is happening, but as of yet, we don't know the specifics behind what Tesla was doing with the rebates.

I do wonder about this.

There is no part of an iPhone that is made in the US except the IP, and that can be transfer priced in very creative ways. AWS and Microsoft have data centres all over the world. Everything NVIDIA makes is physically produced in Taiwan. And Teslas sold in Australia (rapid sales volume drop notwithstanding) are built in China. 

These companies (except maybe Tesla) aren't stupid. None of them are going to want to go down with the ship, and they will find ways to protect their interests. And customers are mostly rational too: Unless Tim Cook starts doing Musk salutes nobody is setting their iPhone on fire.

comment,1jtlvn7,1jtlvn7,,"From the article: Tesla has made a significant update to its Safety Score, removing one of the most controversial metrics – Forward Collision Warnings (FCW)- from the system’s formula. The removal of FCW comes as the company is dealing with a potential class action lawsuit claiming the metric artificially inflated insurance premiums.

Tesla first introduced its Safety Score system to Tesla Insurance in 2021. The system uses real-time driving telemetry to determine scores for several metrics, such as Hard Braking, Aggressive Turning, and more, all of which combine into one overall Safety Score. This score is then used to determine your monthly Tesla Insurance premiums. If you have a good, or high, Safety Score you get a lower insurance premium than someone who has a low Safety Score.

There was one metric that was particularly controversial, and that was FCW. According to Tesla, FCWs were triggered “in events where a possible collision due to an object in front of the vehicle is considered likely without driver intervention.” However, ask any Tesla owner and they will say the FCW system is far from perfect, often giving out false positives when there was no real danger of a collision.

It was enough of a problem that one owner from Illinois filed a potential class action lawsuit against the company, claiming customers were being overcharged on their monthly insurance premiums based on these false warnings.",1738,True,1744034353.0,2025-04-07 15:59:13,83,0,chrisdh79,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1jtlvn7/tesla_removes_forward_collision_warnings_from/mlv432s/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mlv432s

comment,1jtlvn7,1jtlvn7,,"Good, FCW is worthless for this purpose. Don't get me wrong, as a safety feature it's great, and it SHOULD be generally over-protective.

But if you use it to determine premiums, it has to be near-perfect, and arguably it should err towards false negative rather than false positives, which is what it does today.

In our neighborhood, there are a few lazily-curving streets with parallel parking, and even taking it at/below the 15-25mph speed limit, each day we get 4-5 FCW panic beeps from the Model X as it reliably mistakes a parked car on the side of the road for one it thinks we are going to hit, even though that car is clearly off the projected path.

The last 5% is what took Waymo and others years and years to close that gap. This is one field where the last 5% takes 95% of the time.

If you are experiencing *any* disengagement at all, then it's years away from where it needs to be to be fully autonomous on public roads.

If one day the whole Tesla community are all saying they are not seeing *any* disengagement for months at a time, then we know we are close.

comment,1jtv8dx,1jtv8dx,,"That's incorrect. The accident rate while manually driving is actually much higher than the accident rate while using FSD. Why? Because not only has FSD itself become a much more competent driver over time, but also because you can intervene when necessary, and it effectively becomes like having two sets of eyes and brains driving at the same time, where one can catch the other's mistakes. So if you were truly concerned about your life and other people's lives, you'd want to be using FSD. It is factually safer than manually driving.

Also, you're acting as if you must fully rely on FSD. No, you can take over. Eventually it will be good enough where you can fully rely on it, but we're not there yet.

Waymo is built around pre-existing, highly detailed map knowledge and localizes itself within that map to execute driving decisions. Tesla FSD is designed to dynamically perceive and respond to the environment without relying on prior mapping.

This difference directly impacts generalization.

* With a system based on pre-mapped environments, deployment becomes slow and expensive because every operational area needs to be mapped, validated, and continuously revalidated.
* A system that dynamically perceives and adapts can theoretically scale indefinitely, which is why FSD has already been deployed broadly, including its expansion into China.

There are pros and cons to each approach:

* Pre-existing map knowledge can provide very strong performance initially within its operational domain.
* Dynamic perception is harder to perfect but ultimately more flexible and scalable.

So while legal and policy constraints do affect Waymo, it’s likely not the only reason they are limited to specific areas. Their core technical approach inherently makes large-scale generalization and rapid deployment much harder.",1190,False,1744668283.0,2025-04-15 00:04:43,3,0,standardphysics,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1jz3t3i/tesla_rt_elonmusk_for_the_first_time_there_will/mn4wqxc/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mn4wqxc

Tire wear will not be inaccurate by a factor of 2.

They also claim that their normal daily drive distance suddenly spiked from 55 miles per day up to like 75 as their warranty was approaching its end.

The claim isn't ""oh noes it's not a physically measured odometer!"". The claim is that it is deliberately inaccurate. If that's true, it could end up being a huge lawsuit. Your insurance rates are often tied to your expected annual driving distance as conveyed by your odometer.

comment,1k7ka6s,1k7ka6s,,"When it comes to Autonomous driving, the only real metric is ""How many miles / KM has the car driven autonomously?""

Waymo says their fleet has driven 25 million miles.  

Tesla has driven zero autonomous miles at SAE Level 3/4.

Look.  I'm a tesla fan.  I've personally owned three teslas.  Thanks to me, my sister, brother-in-law, father all have teslas.  I'm still invested long in the company.  I'm closer to the company than most people you will ever meet.

But objectively speaking, Waymo is currently driving autonomously, while Tesla is not.

All of this stuff about ""scalability"" is just a momentary distraction.  Sure, tesla has shown they can build factories, and pump out vehicles at scale.  But how many Cybercabs have been mass produced to date?

Maybe the calculus changes in two or three years.

This.  As derisive as Tesla is at the moment, you can't argue their charging network.  But even here,  most chargers aren't that near airports. Not knowing how long it'll take to charge or how busy the charger is doesn't help either when there's a flight you need to catch.   

And this is the easiest to use option.  

CCS in North America? 
Deposits that have to be made in an app you have to download with chargers being broken constantly or that have 1 stall that's full.   I wouldn't wish that on anyone.    

I regularly rented Tesla because they were cheap.  They offered me a bolt once and I refused.  Even if the car was excellent the charging network is not, especially since I didn't bring any RFID cards with me.

For reference, my 2.5 year old LFP Model 3 is already down to around 94-96% capacity, depending on how you measure, after only 631 hours of driving, which equates to 23.5k miles. So 7000 hours of cycling is probably in the 200k-300k miles ballpark, potentially more if you do mostly highway driving.

Edit: I should note, however, that even for current LFP batteries, most of the degradation seems to be from calendar aging, not cyclical (usage-based) aging, so other LFP Tesla owners with 2.5 year old cars likely have similar remaining capacity to me, regardless of whether they drove 5k miles or 50k miles.

comment,1krw9j8,1krw9j8,,"From the article: Elon Musk says he intends to remain CEO of Tesla for at least the next five years, while saying the company is not experience issues with demand, expect in one market. The comments came during a video interview at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday, where Musk responded to questions about his political involvement, leadership at Tesla, and the company’s recent sales figures.

When asked directly if he saw himself continuing as Tesla’s CEO in five years’ time, Musk answered with a simple “Yes.” Pressed further, he added with a laugh, “I can’t be still here if I’m dead.”

Musk’s statements on his continued leadership comes amid growing scrutiny over his political ties and time commitments to projects beyond Tesla, including the U.S. government’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Along with his involvement in DOGE, Musk has donated at least $250 million in support of Trump’s re-election campaign, but that appears to be over, at least for now. Musk said, “I’ve done enough.

comment,1kso4c9,1kso4c9,,"I'm too poor for a model S, but if I was a buyer I would want: 

- front bumper camera, interior lighting ( we know it's coming)

- bigger battery: right now the model S has a 90/100 kWh battery, let's put in the CT battery, so a 120-125kwh, so that it also get's ahead of the lucid and a no-compromise 300 mile/500 km range.

It would also help with towing on the model X

- even faster on the plaid trim

Aka I want the specs that Tesla unveiled for the plaid+ in 2021

- more colors, we really need a dark green ( like the Alfa Romeo one, there was also a model 3 wrap that looked stunning)

- self presenting/soft closing doors

- automatic frunk open/close

- elettro-obscurable roof glass, like the taycan.

They are using a foundation series as an example (which is just tesla's version of a markup and idiotic dealer accessories) and trade in value to do the estimate, Tesla removes FSD on the trade in so the value of that (and your markup package) is worthless), and if you lease one today you get $7.5k off as part of the tax credit, which also factors into depreciation.

It's like buying a first edition land cruiser with $23k of dealer accessories and $8k of markup and then complaining about ""depreciation"" a year later when supply has caught up and you can get one OTD for under MSRP, doesn't make it any more or less successful of a truck for toyota.

A significant majority of the democratic subset won’t buy Tesla while Musk is still involved. A minority of that group, however, will still buy if the car is good and it makes sense economically. 

Republicans aren’t a very EV-friendly group but I suspect those who will buy an EV will look at Tesla very favorably considering Musk’s massive investments in getting Republicans elected. 

The dgaf politically group will buy whatever car makes sense for them. There might be a small % that will hesitate due to the whole “Roman” salute situation but it’s likely a very small subset since the mainstream media basically shrugged it off.

comment,1kwulr6,1kwulr6,,"People are giving you incomplete answers here.

What you noticed probably isn't magic or a placebo.

On Teslas, if the alignment data is reset in the service menu, the car ""forgets"" where the center point of the alignment ""actually physically is"", and sets back to 0 degrees relative to the steering column. Over the next 5, 10, 20, 50 miles, the car keeps track of the position of the steering wheel when the car is driving straight and applies an offset to the value, which adjusts where the car sees it's home/base steering position value. This affects the pull of the steering wheel. This is so that if the steering wheel is off by 1 or 2 degrees, the car won't forever ""pull"" to straighten the wheel out. It'll learn exactly what position the steering wheel must be in for the car to go perfectly straight, and will pull toward that position.

Let's say your tesla had a learned steering offset of -2 degrees. You might not even realize. Car drives perfectly straight with no pull left or right. Then you hit a pothole and bend something or mess something up, and now the ""real center point"" of the steering in order to go down the road straight is more like PLUS 2 degrees instead of minus 2 degrees. The steering wheel is going to be pulling to one side when you let go of the wheel. If somebody went in and RESET that learned steering offset value, now it's back to ""0"" and the steering wheel is going to be pulling to that side HALF as badly.",2459,True,1748371059.0,2025-05-27 20:37:39,21,0,Douche_Baguette,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kwulr6/could_my_tesla_have_fixed_its_own_alignment/muk8kje/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,muk8kje

He’s definitely been showing his ass a lot more within the past year.  His shilling for Musk and Trump is pathetic.  He’s proven many times over the years he knows better, so the current views are an appeal to cult populism.

The biggest lie abiut him is regarding his returns.  On Wall Street, his performance was legitimately excellent.  He averaged something like 24-27% *after* fees, for over 15 years.  That doesn’t happen by luck.  His major calls since retiring would have made you an 8 figure millionaire.  That’s possibly why he spews such overconfidence in things like TSLA and AAPL.  Put simply, they’ve been major multi-bagger successful stories for him, so from his perspective, why not?

He’s a genius in multiple subject areas which is probably what made him a narcissist.  One such area is market whispering, and that has helped his results through some legendary “sell all” calls in which he’s kept his portfolios from getting whacked down to the average.  

He’s made many big and powerful enemies, and they’re the source of 98% of the criticism you’ve absorbed.

comment,1kx4q6n,1kx4q6n,,"* For Texas, you may want to consider tint or a sunshade. I went with tint.
* Yes, the warranty still applies for used through 3rd party. I purchased a used 2023 through the tesla site and received an additional warranty.
* I had to rotate the tires but they were in good shape for 21k miles. I recommend low mileage if it’s in your budget. Long range used tend to have lots of miles. I wanted one but the standard range is doing just fine. I also had to change the filters. The car needs new wipers. That’s it for maintenance. My car had a crack in the sunroof that I missed during delivery. Fortunately Tesla replaced it free.
* I had FSD free for 30 days loved it. It comes with a subscription for all Tesla’s at $99/month plus tax. You can purchase through the car or app. You may also wantbto subscribe to the premium connectivity for internet service it was cheaper to subscribe to a one year term for like $100.
* Do a thorough walk through. Make a list or find one online.
* If this is your first EV consider the costs for charger installation Nema or wall charger. Will the car come with a mobile charger? Mine did not so I paid like $300 for mobile and $515 for wall charger plus install.
* Try to get the $4k tax credit if you can. Tesla offers it at point of sale and so does Carvana.

This is my first EV and during my research 90% of Tesla owners recommended percentage (seems to be consistent with the comments here). That’s what I’m using however it did take some getting used to. 

*Tip: while learning your vehicle, take it on a trip and see how the percentage/mileage changes as you accelerate. Be sure to use GPS. Then try to get to a steady speed and see how consistent it becomes. The percentage/mileage for your trip will become more accurate and you will know that the change/accuracy for the GPS is in your control. Not much different than any other car. Higher RPM’s means you’re buring more gas/mile. The Tesla doesn’t exactly have this gauge, at least not in my model 3.

comment,1kx5c3a,1kx5c3a,,">""In China, we see intense competition and Tesla is no longer seen as the technology leader.""

I think this is the real kicker here. 

While the sales decline worldwide (especially in the US) has *some* to do with Elon's salute and his time at Doge,  I think other factors have contributed much more to it. Tesla's sales have been shrinking for the past two years.

A very limited and aging lineup, 3/5 of which are out of the reach of the average person has played a big role. More people want SUVs over sedans, so Tesla is effectively competing with just one model. I don't think the refresh was significant enough for people to want to upgrade.

I too believe that nobody thinks of them as the technology leader anymore which is why the competition has been able to gain a foothold. 

Their tech is still better than the competition in North America in the sense that everything just works and works seamlessly, lag free, but I don't think that's gonna cut it anymore. Model Y is still the highest selling EV in most places but I doubt it'll be for long.",1057,False,1748402118.0,2025-05-28 05:15:18,31,0,ChickenFlavoredCake,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kx5c3a/byd_xiaomi_overtake_tesla_as_top_ev_brand_choices/mumxrsr/,True,,2025,both,hot,False,False,0,mumxrsr

The true competitors are Xpeng, zeekr , Nio and Li auto (and  xiaomi and huawei). The reality is that those companies offer something different or more compared to tesla. Nio does battery swap, xpeng and huawei are seen as a leaders in driverless systems, Li auto does extended range EV and is targeting the roadtrip/outdoors market, xiaomi does performance vehicles for enthusiasts.

comment,1kx7hp9,1kx7hp9,,"This is true.  I just did the used card EV credit.  Here is what you need.
1. Car cannot be more than $25000, not counting tax, title and license (all that other crap counts towards the $25000 limit)
2. Your taxable income for the year you are applying for (you can retro apply it to last year) can't be more than $75000 ($150,000 joint).
3. Car has to be only one previous owner. (Ask the dealer for the carmax report...it will tell you if it is only 1-owner or not)
4. The model of the used EV must be 2 years or more older than the current model out.
5. Also must be from a dealer, not a personal sale (not 100% sure on this part)...because the dealer has to register with the IRS in order to give you credit for the used EV.   As a matter of fact, when I bought it, the dealer did the paperwork for me, sent it in and gave me the credit in about 2 weeks and released the car to me.  Didn't need to wait to wait for a refund to get it back.

SOunds like a lot, but it's worth saving $4000

Also if you can swing it, you can get some great deals on 2023  Model 3 for right at $25000, with very low mileage and still have warranty on it.  I got a 2023 Model 3 at $21000 after the credit.  Had 25K miles on it and still had a year of warranty left.

comment,1kxi4rf,1kxi4rf,,"Yeah also trying to guess Tesla prices is kind of crazy.  I watched for years before snagging my '24 MYLR for $38k after fed rebate back when they had discounts for VINs that sat on the lot too long (*had a small door ding - no paint damage -that Tesla fixed for me with PDR after pickup, that's why it sat around and was discounted in my case).*

You never know when incentives will change.  If you plan on financing a Model Y, the 1.99% APR deal is really amazing and is a huge discount people tend to not realize.  Plus all the extra referral discounts and everything, it's really hard to beat todays price on a Juniper.

But I suppose you are looking at a Model 3, so perhaps there will be another low APR deal on the highland.  Anyway, all I am saying is Tesla will KNOW the discount is going away, and they will advertise the crap out of the fact it no longer will exist, and likely discounts won't be quite as strong in Nov/Dec if I had to guess ...",956,False,1748449480.0,2025-05-28 18:24:40,2,0,abgtw,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kxi4rf/if_the_tax_credits_go_away_when_would_be_the_last/muq31u3/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,muq31u3

For people who want to see the details, subsection 112002(a) of the bill says:

        (a) In General.--Section 30D is amended--
                (1) by redesignating subsection (h) as subsection (i), and
                (2) in subsection (i), as so redesignated, by striking 
            ``December 31, 2032'' and inserting ``December 31, 2026''

This changes [26 USC Section 30D(h)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&edition=prelim&req=granuleid%3AUSC-2010-title26-section30D&num=0) to read:

>~~(h)~~ **(i)** Termination

>No credit shall be allowed under this section with respect to any vehicle placed in service after ~~December 31, 2032~~ **December 31, 2026**.

The next subsection of the bill goes on to say that for vehicles placed in service during 2026, there is a 200,000 vehicle cap. So, for Tesla, the substantive language can effectively be summarized as: ""No credit shall be allowed under this section with respect to any Tesla vehicle placed in service after December 31, 2025.""

We can then read [26 CFR Section 1.30D-2(b)(36)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-26/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-1/subject-group-ECFRcb39f040b41b74b/section-1.30D-2) for what ""placed in service"" means:

Let’s face it: the number of enthusiasts with cars whose model years are between 1976 and 1990, and who want an exemption, is low.

All 1.6-liter (1551cc through 1650cc) engines that are EFI and naturally aspirated have to meet the same standard. All 1.8-liter (1751cc through 1850cc) engines that are EFI and turbocharged have to meet the same standard. Cats are unlimited, but required.

The state has the information from which to build the necessary numbers but doesn’t, because CARB is stupid- necessary and helpful, but stupid.

* Your dad:
   * Intends to buy a used Tesla, 
   * Qualifies for the used EV tax credit,

   * Does not qualify to get a loan to buy a Tesla.
* You and your brother:

Your question is, ""Will putting your name and your brother's name on the loan and (I presume) any title documents cause any problems with your dad getting the tax credit?"" 

Answer: probably not.  

As far as the IRS is concerned, it seems as though only the person the dealer reports to the IRS as the buyer needs to qualify for the used tax credit.  The IRS doesn't exactly say this, but here are the clues:

In [IRS FS-2024-26, page 4, A11](https://www.irs.gov/pub/taxpros/fs-2024-26.pdf#page=4), the IRS mentioned multiple people getting the *new* EV tax credit:

>The name and taxpayer identification number of the owner claiming the New Clean Vehicle Credit should be listed on the seller’s report. See Topic B, FAQ 9. Accordingly, multiple owners of a new clean vehicle should inform the seller which owner will claim the New Clean Vehicle Credit so that the seller can identify that taxpayer on the seller’s report. **The credit would be allowed only on the tax return of the owner listed in the seller’s report.",3559,True,1748482402.0,2025-05-29 03:33:22,3,0,SirMontego,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kxxgm4/cosign_on_used_ev_credit/mut2xr0/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mut2xr0

Tesla's ridiculous share price is based largely on forward looking ""promises""... Cars that drive themselves, robots that do everything for you, trucks that make freight trains seem expensive, battery storage, etc.  Vaporware until it rolls off the lot, forgiven until now because there's been enough money in the meantime from the actual, real world car sales.

And car sales are sliding, yes because of the brand damage.  But as much, if not more so, because there are better, cheaper alternatives.  No more first mover advantage with years of better tech in the pipe.  Just a tired design with old tech.

So unless robo-taxis miraculously appear in huge numbers in American cities and perform better than Waymo, and manage to not kill anyone, then Tesla is toast.

I’m driving in Ann Arbor for at least a year, likely two. After that, I’ll either sell or bring the car to NYC — where street parking and crime make a nice car a risk.

# Option 1: Used Tesla Model 3 (2020+, ~$20–25K)

* Pros: Dream car, $4K EV tax credit, tech, fun to drive, could be worth it for 2 years of joy
* Cons: Battery degradation unknown, no home charger (would supercharge every 2 weeks), depreciation, might be overkill if I sell in 2 years or bring it to NYC

# Option 2:  Used Mazda CX-5 (2017+, ~$17-20K)

* Pros: Stylish, reliable, gas is simpler than charging, more peace of mind than Tesla, good resale
* Cons: Still relatively pricey, not EV, higher fuel and maintenance costs than Tesla

# Option 3: 2015 Chevy Cruze (~$4K friend selling for cheap)

* Pros: Cheap, minimal financial risk, but scared of big repair, great for short-term use, low insurance
* Cons: High mileage (\~122K), worried about surprise repair costs, might not enjoy driving...",1729,True,1748502623.0,2025-05-29 09:10:23,1,0,RandomFish1234,cars,https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1kvtshb/what_car_should_i_buy_a_weekly_megathread/muud305/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,muud305

That's how it works now. I can register my 30 year old federal emissions vehicle in California because it meets the standard it had to. The only snaffoo is when my cat fails I can't replace it with another federal cat, I must buy the expensive California cat. 

Concession #3 isn't a distinction I give a fuck about, it's expensive or expensiver. So everyone will still register it in Montana because you still have to maintain an expensive emissions system.

comment,1ky6ef5,1ky6ef5,,"Continuing our series on California EV sales in the first quarter, we’re now on to overall auto brand rankings. Why spend so much time on California? Well, if it was a country (and the rest of the US was still a country), it would be the 10th largest auto market in the world. Furthermore, it would rank even higher if we were focused on top EV markets. (Though, I don’t have that data on hand — perhaps a story for another day.)

  
Also, being the birthplace of Tesla and being a bastion of progressivism, it’s a fascinating market for examining Tesla sales trends. In fact, if we split the US up into states and combined European countries into one market (I know, now we’re getting weird), California would only trail China (\~135,000) and Europe (\~53,000) in Tesla sales.

Anyway, let’s get on to the trends. As you can see in the chart below, Tesla sales declined by about 7,000 units in the 1st quarter compared to the 1st quarter of 2024. With Honda climbing by about 5,000 sales (and Toyota climbing by about 5,000 sales), that actually meant that Tesla dropped from the second best selling auto brand in the Golden State to the third best selling auto brand in the Golden State.

Used 1st(ish) generation EVs are getting quite affordable. Obviously check the model or brand specific subreddit for common issues, but a used EV is a great value, even with nominal battery degradation. 

As an example, I was shopping for a new commuter car and I wanted an EV. I wanted a small, efficient EV that didn’t look ridiculous. I also didn’t want to spend $25k - $50k for a new car that would depreciate as soon as I signed the paperwork. 

I didn’t need a lot of range, since it’s going back and forth to work and around town. Automated driving was a low priority, because I actually like to drive, though some enhanced safety features are fine. Similarly, have the ability to use DCFC in a pinch was good, but I didn’t need huge max DC speed. 

After looking at leafs, ford focus EVs, miniEVs, and others, I zeroed in on the e-Golf. The 2017-20 versions have DCFC and a “larger” battery that gets over 125mi in EPA and real-life driving in good weather. Some also have heat pumps for HVAC that help mitigate winter losses, though at the cost of a potential failure point.

It’s worked extremely well for me and it’s nice to get a short walk in the neighborhood. As such I’ve never supercharged except in road trips. It’s also a lot cheaper than supercharging.

For road trips I regularly travel out of state and it works extremely well. I prefer the ABRP app for routes though, as I think the car nav isn’t great for time optimization.

comment,1kyld3i,1kyld3i,,"1. If you have a 2007 Prius only getting 35mpg something is wrong. You should be well over 40mpg.  
  
2. L2 will be more efficient than L1 by a few percentage points.  
  
3. Do not use any stated range numbers for EVs they all tend to be over estimates. Remember, the battery will also degrade significantly over time.   
  
ICE EPA figures are pretty accurate nowadays...EV stuff isn't. However, the 32 miles that our Chrysler and BMW were supposed to get was pretty accurate.   
  
4. We've had hybrids (Prius 2005), PHEVs (Chrysler Pacifica and BMW x5), and an EV (Y AWD LR) - For long trips the PHEV is the way to go. Even with Tesla charging stations you're going to add signficant time to your trip and there's no guarantee that the charging station is going to have services nearby...and if they do whether they'll be open.

Of the PHEVs we've driven the Hyunda Santa Fe was pretty nice. The Mazdas were a little rough...especially when the battery was run out. I think they need a bit more time to get them right. The Toyota Rav 4 and Lexus were both really nice. The Lexus TX was the nicest of all...including our BMW x5 45e.

Why do we own a Y...well, we needed a car and at the end of '24 Tesla was offering discounts, rebates, 0% financing, etc. that brought the effective  cost of the car down to around $30k. At that price there really wasn't anything that competes.

comment,1kyld3i,1kyld3i,,"> As a side note, even though we don't want to deal with range anxiety, we notice regular EVs tend to have a far better efficiency rating in this sense. A Tesla Y is 27kWh/100 miles, meaning (at this special PG&E rate plan) our total cost for home charging would be 8.4 cents per mile.

This is not surprising given the specific vehicles you compared. You're looking at larger PHEVs which also are using inefficient parallel hybrid setup (as opposed to much more efficient power-split of Prius/Rav4 which I don't believe has been put in any larger PHEVs yet). And comparing them to Model Y which is smaller and made by a company that really worked hard to get their efficiency/range numbers up (through aerodynamics, an advanced hvac system, and some goofery with EPA test cycles)",780,False,1748554058.0,2025-05-29 23:27:38,2,0,iamtherussianspy,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kyld3i/new_vehicle_purchase_check_my_gaskwh_math_please/muyhn8u/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,muyhn8u

I had the cash so paying 120k for the truck was not a big deal because I was okay with it and wanted it. I didn’t buy it for a future value I bought it because I liked it.

I will say I drive it daily and you are likely to run into haters still so if that is any indication they are doing their best to drive down the price. You can guess it will come down but again it doesn’t really change the fact that if you are okay with 70k for it then it doesn’t matter what it comes down to.

comment,1kyrdrn,1kyrdrn,,"I bought a used one last year. The following factored in:

It felt like FSD was likely to get close in the next 12 months, but was considered almost without value in a used car, making it effectively free. 12 came out a couple months later and I felt validated LOL.

I work in auto and knew Tesla would either have to upgrade cars with insufficient hardware, repay the value, or make very attractive transfers to newer cars.

Once FSD unsupervised comes online, cost will skyrocket on both subscriptions and outright purchase.

Since buying, it's become clear that A) HW3 won't get there, and B) HW4 probably won't either. A transfer to AI5 is the move.
