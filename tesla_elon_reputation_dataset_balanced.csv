post,5lukba,,Q4 Deliveries,"Tesla Q4 2016 Production and Deliveries



PALO ALTO, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 01/03/17 -- Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) produced 24,882 vehicles in Q4, resulting in total 2016 production of 83,922 vehicles. This was an increase of 64% from 2015.

Tesla delivered approximately 22,200 vehicles in Q4, of which 12,700 were Model S and 9,500 were Model X. When added to the rest of the year, total 2016 deliveries were approximately 76,230.Our Q4 delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct.

Because of short-term production challenges starting at the end of October and lasting through early December from the transition to new Autopilot hardware, Q4 vehicle production was weighted more heavily towards the end of the quarter than we had originally planned. We were ultimately able to recover and hit our production goal, but the delay in production resulted in challenges that impacted quarterly deliveries, including, among other things, cars missing shipping cutoffs for Europe and Asia. Although we tried to recover these deliveries and expedite others by the end of the quarter, time ran out before we could deliver all customer cars. In total, about 2,750 vehicles missed being counted as deliveries in Q4 either due to last-minute delays in transport or because the customer was unable to physically take delivery. Even where these customers had already fully paid for their vehicle, we still did not count these as deliveries in Q4.

In addition to Q4 deliveries, about 6,450 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the quarter. These will be counted as deliveries in Q1 2017.

Vehicle demand in Q4 was particularly strong. Q4 net orders for Model S and X, which were an all-time record for us, were 52% higher than Q4 2015 and 24% higher than our previous record quarter in Q3 2016.",2236,True,1483478170.0,2017-01-03 22:16:10,90,89,john_atx,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/5lukba/q4_deliveries/,True,0.94,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,5oshks,,"Tesla's supply chain is highly dependent on high quality Lithium, Cobalt, and Graphite.","Tesla.  Love em or hate em they're building a giant battery factory, maybe you've heard of it.  Here are some commodities that may expand their business or severely limit their supply chain depending on which way the crystal ball reveals the future.

Every now and then someone with insight mentions the various Lithium mining stocks that will help to feed their Gigafactory. Tesla requires the use of high grade lithium to accomplish their goals, and mines will need to step it up in terms of quality and quantity to maintain supplies.  Also, Graphite and Cobalt are critical minerals needed for building other components in EVs. 

The lithium mines alone are a highly contentious market, and not one (or 5) clear dominant forces seem poised to take control in this space.  It is similarly true of Cobalt that many mines produce cobalt, but there isn't one major player that is in control of the supply, finally the major supply of graphite comes from China at the moment, but some high quality mines are in canada.  All of these minerals are not ready for a sudden increase in demand, unless their supply lines are significantly upscaled and also tailored to meet the quality standards of these soon to be completed gigafactories.

Enjoy reading this article.  It's very exciting.

Also, understand that any investment in the mining space for the EV supply line is a long term investment, you won't see any short term gainz within a week, but if you pick the right ponies, you might see a huge gain if the EV market actually does take off in 5-10 years in an appreciable way.",1715,False,1484777209.0,2017-01-18 23:06:49,91,31,Leroy--Brown,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/5oshks/teslas_supply_chain_is_highly_dependent_on_high/,True,0.96,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,
comment,5oshks,5oshks,,"Northern Graphite - NGPHF 

Pure Energy Minerals (Lithium) - PEMIF 

E-cobalt - ECSIF 

These are the most promising cobalt, graphite and lithium junior mining companies in my opinion. See below for a previous post of mine:

Currently 70 to 80% of the world’s graphite is mined in China. The mines are getting very deep and depleted. Production around the world needs to increase to keep up with the demand. If you do the math: There is up to 70 Kgs of graphite in an electric vehicle. That means 100,000 tonnes of graphite is needed for every million EVs (which is 1.5% of the car market). Research shows that if the EV market reached 5% of all vehicles, graphite production would need to double. North America needs to start producing electric vehicle quality spherical graphite to keep up with these predictions.

Lithium is experiencing a similar strain. Demand is expected to be as high as 125% of supply by 2020 due to electric vehicles and grid storage. The price of lithium has increased by 300% since 2003. When it comes to electric vehicles the quality of the lithium is crucial. Pure Energy Minerals has developed an extracting method that results in 90% pure lithium compared to the 30% standard and does it in a fraction of the time. Due to this high purity they have signed a 5 year deal with Tesla.

post,5owhq2,,Tesla Upgraded by Morgan Stanley - enjoy the short squeeze,"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/19/morgan-stanley-upgrades-tesla-giving-4-reasons.html

Price target: $305 by Q4 2017. 

Shares are up ~4% in pre-market on this news. 

Morgan Stanley is the first investment bank to upgrade Tesla this year. I expect many banks to do the same as the Model 3 is launching by H2 2017. 

Of course, there is the possibility that Tesla may delay the release of the Model 3, which may prevent it from reaching Morgan Stanley's current Q4 target price of $305. 

However, I doubt that the Model 3 will be delayed any further than Q1 2018, and that is a conservative estimate. I really do think Tesla will get its act together and deliver the Model 3 on time (with a 5% margin of error which translates to +/- a few weeks). 

In the extra long-term, I expect Tesla to reach $500+. It is a ""bubble stock"", and just like how investors played Amazon back a few years ago, I expect the same thing to happen to Tesla. 

Tesla may look overpriced, but it's more than just an auto company. It is an energy solutions company that is transforming both the auto and energy industries all in one-shot. It's very different from investing in traditional auto companies like GM, which offer good value, a dividend but much lower potential growth. 

GM may be rolling out electric cars, but it is years behind Tesla in terms of charging networks and AI. And before you say that other automakers are on-track to manufacture self-driving cars for cheaper with the same quality, remember Tesla is not just an auto company, it is a energy solutions company that is propagating the next revolution in TWO industries, not just one.

post,5qw8wm,,An infrastructure prediction before we find out what The Boring Company is all about. (x-post r/BoringCompany),"Before ground is broken on whatever this tunnel project turns out to be, I wanted to register a guess as to what Elon's BoringCo Los Angeles tunnel could look like.

I think Elon has a long-term plan to help alleviate California's transport woes, all borne of his daily commute in famous Los Angeles traffic, which is most likely a straight line up and down the 405 between Hawthorne and the Santa Monica Mountains. Pending regulatory approvals (which I know nothing about), Elon could start digging from below or beside the SpaceX campus in Hawthorne, in a NW direction mostly inline with the 405. This would pass just west of the Inglewood Oil Field.

Digging could be performed by some new design of TBM that Elon hasn't shared yet, with perhaps additional machinery to expand the tunnel outwards once the initial tunnel has been bored. If he's serious about this idea, which is tough to gauge, then he's probably got an idea or two about how he's going to accomplish it. Don't ask about timelines, though.

In the short term (BoringCo LA v1), once the initial tunnel has been bored, Elon can completely eliminate his personal commute time. As soon as the v1 tunnel, however narrow, passes through the nice neighborhoods in the mountains, he's home free. He can even justify it as being ""in the best interest of humanity"" due to his rapid iteration on systems that improve our collective quality of life. It wouldn't be the whole point of the exercise, but a nice temporary perk. For science.

In the long term (BoringCo LA v2), however, this first tunnel traveling along the 405 through LA would turn into a multi-lane (8? 10? 12? 14? 16?) freeway reserved for swarm-enabled self-driving vehicles.

post,5sq4h0,,"Check out our Electric Supercharger! - No, Seriously.","Backstory: 

We are a couple of students at Olin College of Engineering who love cars and the pursuit of making them go faster. We are currently involved with [Baja SAE](http://www.olinbaja.com) , [FSAE Electric](https://www.olinelectricmotorsports.com), and an offshoot 24 Hrs of Lemons team. Off season, we work at CyPhy Drones and Tesla. Never willing to leave well enough alone, we think that we may have stumbled upon a newfangled way to reliably increase the output of IC engines.

What have we done?

We’ve developed a supercharger utilizing shaft power from an electric motor capable of delivering a static pressure of at least 5-7 pounds of boost. We are in the process of gathering the resources needed for further test results (such as flow rate vs pressure). Before you dismiss the idea outright and click off to another tab, we know you’ve heard the same story before from items like eBay “superchargers” and whatnot that promise the world and don’t deliver anything more than glorified hairdryer. Just give us a chance and you will not be disappointed.

Our Prototype

In a nutshell, we built a system that mates a high-output (~ 7 horsepower @ 100,000 rpm) permanent magnet motor to compressor side of a turbocharger. Full disclosure: It’s currently re-wound BLDC motor with custom spec’d ceramic bearings capable of handling such an ungodly angular velocity. We took the running gear from a Toyota CT-26 turbocharger and re-machined the compressor-side hardware and fabricated a couple custom designed components to mate and seal the assembly. Now, we’re certainly not the first to have attempted this, but in every previous example we can gather, there a couple critical flaws preventing real gains. 1st: Speed. Turbine powered turbochargers spin well into the 100K range, most motors aren’t going to be so happy providing that (for very long, at least!). Motor selection and modification was a paramount variable to enable this. 2nd: Power.",3806,True,1486522368.0,2017-02-08 03:52:48,83,100,ARCsuperchargers,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/5sq4h0/check_out_our_electric_supercharger_no_seriously/,True,0.83,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

> We’ve developed a supercharger utilizing shaft power from an electric motor capable of delivering a static pressure of at least 5-7 pounds of boost

* Can you please advise what you mean by 'static pressure'? If that's literally what the system will produce in a closed system (Which looks like the case in the video) then it will be very different on an engine. Which leads to my next question...
* What capacity engine do you see this producing 5-7psi on?
* What RPM is this pressure at? As you'd know, maintaining 7psi at 2000rpm is VERY different from 7psi at 6000rpm and the normal question is, if you can do 7psi at 6000rpm, why aren't you doing say 14psi at 2000rpm.
* The above 2 questions can possibly be answered with a single one... How much volume is the system flowing?
* What motor you're using? Most centrifugal type blowers use **at least** 30hp to run, and even that's on the low side. How does your 7hp motor compare?

post,5uijr2,,"I have a question to ask of r/cars in general, it concerns how electric cars are presented or understood, as I am personally skeptical of many pro-EV opinions.","***Edit: Please. read. the. post. before. commenting.*** *This doesn't apply to the majority, but some need to be told.*

Basically, when it comes to how electric vehicles have been presented, there always seems to be a lot of concern that they ""won't charge up to 300/400/500 miles in 2/3/5 minutes"", despite that for such a power-dependent equivalent of ""fuelling"", the power levels required are absurd enough to warrant reliability and cost concerns, **even if the battery chemistry is capable of the lightness, compactness, power, and durability, which we are also assuming in the questions below.**

Just a Tesla-sized 100 kWh (usable) battery pack I am assuming to be capable of between 300-400 miles range at between 3-4 miles/kWh, cruising that is, recharging in 5 minutes, would require a *continuous average* draw of 100 kWh x (60min/5min) = 1,200 kW (or approx. 1,600 hp) eq. of electrical power input, after minor inefficiencies.

So, outside the concept of energy carriers (e.g. hydrogen, synthetic fuels and the largely theoretical sort of metal-air batteries) to offer convenience on a level that would be acceptable to the majority of existing road users whilst minimising the need for education, it would be logical to reduce one of the characteristics to bring things down to a more mundane level: reduce the range so that charging takes less power for the same time, or charge across available larger timescales in certain locales to preserve range.

#So I thought it would be a very good idea to ask the good ol'timers of r/cars to ask this:

*If you couldn't use any other types of car or vehicle for whatever contrived reason, out of the two electrically powered car options, which one of the following three would you choose?*

I realize you calculated for some of these advancements but I think this problem will almost be completely solved by the time EVs inevitably dominate the market. In Tesla's original plan, I don't think they implemented it, but they had the capability to take the battery off the underside and replace it with a fresh one in minutes. Maybe we'll see an evolution of this, where people on long road trips can go to one of the battery swap stations if it would save time and get a fully recharged battery in minutes. That is, of course, if we don't solve this problem in the way we currently are, by quick charging.

You mentioned ""much like Tesla"" which is why I put in that caveat since they only gain about 170 miles of range in half an hour and Superchargers have 2 plugs per circuit and if a second car plugs into your circuit your charging speed will be reduced. Also it should be noted that the advertised combined range of 315 miles for the Model S P100 is based on a 55mph highway speed.

To expand my view about this though none of these options would be ideal in my opinion which is why I'm hoping hydrogen fuel cell cars take off. 5 minutes to a 300-400 mile range is better than any of the pure electrical charging options.

post,5ultvb,,Bought a 2017 Ford Fusion Energi Titanium - Why aren't these everywhere?,"I have been looking for a good deal on a replacement for my 2014 Ford Focus Electric as my lease is coming to an end in a few months--I prefer electric or plug in hybrids because it gives me access to the HOV lanes on my commute, which saves me ~15 minutes a day.  I can also charge at home and at work.  I had a Tesla 3 Reservation but didn't want to spend $40k+ on a car (once I add what I want to it, I'm sure it will be north of 40k.)

I wanted a Fusion Energi and was going to purchase new when my lease was up, but I found what I consider to be a pretty insane deal--I jumped on it.

I ended up with a 2017 Fusion Energi Titanium with every option except adaptive cruise.  The car itself is flawless.  My commute is ~28 miles each way (56miles roundtrip) and I'm getting an average of 92mpg on that commute.  It's kind of nuts.

Original sticker price was $39900.  I paid $21777 for the car and it was a Certified Pre-owned car through ford, which means I get an additional 12k miles and 12 months of warranty stacked on top of the factory 36mo/36k warranty.  That's 45% off sticker on a 6 month old car with 11k miles on it.

How did I do?

I realize this sort of car isn't for everyone, but if you commute a decent distance it's insanely cheap to operate, drives pretty well, and is comfortable as hell.  Has TONS of tech in it--I was surprised to hear it does wi-fi based updates to the infotainment system if you connect it to your home wifi.

post,5vc0ev,,Picked up my dream car at the dealership last night!,"[UPDATED W/ Video] Well, I say dream car, but it wasn't really. My dream car growing up ha d always been the M3 (and more recently, the M2 after it was announced). Those cars just always seemed attainable, even if in some distant future. I loved Jaguars, but never really thought I'd be in able to get one, let alone the F-Type R. It just didn't seem disable, even just a couple of years ago.

Picked it up from the dealership last night after getting the financing settled over the weekend. I was literally giddy on the drive to get it. Like that feeling right before a first date - a little nervous, slightly terrified, but very excited.

A couple of things about the F-Type R that the reviews don't do enough justice to:

1. This thing is fast, and loud. Everyone says those things, but you really just don't get it until you sit down in one and floor it. Like, terrifyingly, squeezed into the back of your seat fast. Not as fast as a Tesla, but the fact that it's screaming at you the whole time makes the experience that much more visceral.
2. Visibility is not nearly as bad as people say it is. Yes, the rear window is tiny, so visibility behind you is mostly non-existent. But the side windows are large and mostly free of obstructions. And besides, anything that's behind you is staying there, anyway.
3. The ride is a little hard, but easily tolerable as a daily driver. South Florida is famous for shitty roads, but I found that it wasn't significantly bumper than my MINI countryman.
4. Did I mention how loud it is?

So the moral of the story is dream big. No, bigger than that. Keep dreaming, and it just might come true.

8. Why drive your car when it drives itself
9. (because it's fun as shit)
10. Why not profit from gov sponsored and commercially breaking orbit and potentially, eventually, mining space minerals. What could possibly be more profitable?
11. *EDIT* why not cut out dealerships, increasing Model 3 (s, x) margin?

Can all of this be priced in already? When so little of it is on the balance sheet? I get model 3 sales are do or die, I get the run up is built on this hype already. I get people don't trust musk. But I'm pissed I didn't buy more this afternoon.

1. What stocks should I keep an eye on
I understand you guys are a big fan of tesla, and I could understand why. Are there any others that would be really interesting to follow?

post,5y0v7t,,TSLA about to make a big move. Maybe the last chance to get in before the real Model 3 bull run,"I just did a technical analysis on TSLA stock and I expect a big move (up or down) in the coming days. Reasons why I think this is going to be a big move (50%+) up. 

1. Model 3 is coming up. When Tesla releases its new models, its stock always skyrockets (e.g. +51% for the Model X). 

2. Oil prices are rising. Tesla stock and oil prices are intimately related according to history. 

3. The popularity of Tesla's Powerwall is only starting to kick in for the company. 

4. I expect the new Tesla ""low"" to be around $210, not $180 anymore. However, I would not take chances, and just buy now. 

5. There is a very high chance that Tesla will reach $310+ by the start of 2018 according to the charts. 

6. According to a new report, Tesla's sales growth in China has just doubled. That makes China Tesla's 2nd largest market after the US.

post,5yptnc,,Best Tech Stocks to Buy in 2017,"Tech stocks record the highest potential of growth, which is natural considering the Internet of Things movement and the continuously spreading wireless cloud.I am going to outline a few of the stocks which are my potential investments in various technology branches for 2017.

* Starting with entertainment, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) seems like a worthy stock to buy this year as analysts predict a growth of 24% during this time. What gives Netflix a reliable backing is the subscribing structure. Not only is it increasing exceedingly, but the customers tend to be long term rather than one time buyers.

* As for automobiles, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) shows numerous proofs that this year the company is going to outperform the market. The underlying idea that ensures Tesla a successful year is their open attitude for innovation and revolution. Their new project, the Autopilot, is one of the reasons why I predict an upside. Additionally, their collaboration with Google makes 2017 even more promising.

* The last entry is Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ: ADBE). As last year performance is a crucial metric, we must not undermine Adobe which had a 5.8 billion total income in 2016. However, i would say that ADBE is even more prolific as a long term investment as it tends to show tiny upside and downside fluctuations during the quarter, but keeps an ascending tendency speaking on long run.


In the final analysis, this year is going to be life changing for most of the companies because of the unprecedented political and financial events. That is why I would like to hear more experienced traders’ opinion on the stocks I have chosen.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known for short bursts of activity on Twitter, oftentimes answering fans and reporters questions on the social media platform.

On Friday, as Musk was on a flight to Cape Canaveral—presumably to attend to business related to SpaceX, the aerospace company he also runs—the billionaire entrepreneur shared a number of new details about the Model 3, a video, and even the solar roof tiles Tesla plans to sell.

Here’s what we learned:

First the basics, Musk wanted to clarify that Model 3 is not simply a next version of a Tesla.

He later got more specific about the Model 3 in response to several questions from the above tweet.

- It will have Autopilot capabilities, which has been shared before.
- It will still be awesome. When asked Musk’s reply was “definitely.”
- Musk then added the Model 3 will be like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. “Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot,” he tweeted.
- It should be able to fit a large cooler in the trunk of the Model 3 (a response a concern about trunk space in sedans).
- It won’t contain any significantly new technology that has yet to be introduced to the S or X. Musk says there’s lots of new tech in the design and production process, but nothing “majorly new that a consumer would notice.”
- The shorter wheelbase of the Model 3 only allows for a 75 kilowatt-hour battery pack in Model 3. But, that doesn’t mean it won’t have a greater range than the Chevy Bolt EV, which can travel 238 miles on a single charge.

The things that will have the largest impact on TSLA stock:

1. Model 3 - whether or not it will launch and deliver to customers on time

2. US economy - the US economy is growing steadily - this is a big positive for auto sales

3. Tesla Energy - I easily see this as being a huge profit-making opportunity to Tesla and it seems to tick all the boxes. Efficiency and scale is everything here. No company can compete here. 

However, it's not just their Solar Roofs or Powerwall business, it's also their Electric Vehicles (EV) business. The short-sellers are betting that companies like GM, Ford, Hyundai, Nissan, and BMW are going to beat Tesla with more affordable EVs. However, the fact of the matter is that none of these companies produce Lithium Ion batteries and most of them are sourced from Samsung SDI, LG Chem and Chinese battery suppliers.

post,631nux,,Q1 2017 Deliveries,"PALO ALTO, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 04/02/17 -- Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) delivered just over 25,000 vehicles in Q1, of which approx 13,450 were Model S and approx 11,550 were Model X. This was a new quarterly record for us and represents a 69% increase over Q1 2016. Our delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct. Final numbers could vary by up to 0.5%.

In addition to Q1 deliveries, about 4,650 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the quarter. These will be counted as deliveries in Q2 2017.

Q1 production totaled 25,418 vehicles. This was also a new quarterly record for us.

Tesla vehicle deliveries represent only one measure of the company's financial performance and should not be relied on as an indicator of quarterly financial results, which depend on a variety of factors, including the cost of sales, foreign exchange movements and mix of directly leased vehicles.

comment,631nux,631nux,,"You can argue it either way.  Obviously Tesla doesn't turn a net profit, but that's not really the argument here.  Ignoring the really stupid and blatantly false arguments (Tesla has negative gross margins, Tesla has the highest gross margins ever, etc.), it basically comes down to what you consider ""losing money"" on each car.

The ""no"" argument is pretty simple: Tesla has ~23% gross margins overall, and ~0.5% higher gross margins on their cars.  That includes parts, labor, manufacturing overhead, shipping, electricity and whatnot for Superchargers, and warranty reserve.  So to build the car, ship it, and warranty it, Tesla is not losing money on each car.

The ""yes"" argument is a bit more complex, but basically comes down to the fact that Tesla has negative operating margins.   That includes CoR but also includes SG&A and R&D, so cost of keeping stores/service centers open, sales costs, marketing expenses, IT, legal expenses, HR, etc, as well as R&D costs (self-explanatory).  So if you include all the costs associated with developing and selling the car (which is common practice in the industry) and cost of the company as a whole actually existing, they do lose money on each car sold.

The obvious counterargument is that R&D and whatnot are artificially inflated because of the Model 3 ramp, but even if you take out all Model 3-related expenses, Tesla's operating margins are still very very slim or negative.",1910,True,1491173278.0,2017-04-03 00:47:58,18,0,jetshockeyfan,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/631nux/q1_2017_deliveries/dfqunx1/,True,,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,dfqunx1

I don't *know* what's going to happen to enough of a degree of certainty to wager my real life money on it.

post,64828o,,Is Trump slowing the release of new EV models?,"The Chevy Bolt still has limited availability. The Hyundai Ioniq EV is now being released only in California. The Trump administration is likely to reduce the EPA's CAFE standards which essentially require some EV sales to meet future average fleet mileage requirements. It is rumored they may rescind the exception that allows California to set more strict vehicle mileage and pollution standards.

EVs are selling better worldwide but growth is slow in the US. Is the likelihood of regulatory change killing the market for new EVs? Tesla enthusiasm is going strong but other carmakers seem to have slowed their pace. I hope I'm wrong about this. What have you heard? 

**EDIT-** Maybe I'm being misunderstood. I worry that this is true. I keep seeing little stories that point towards trouble, but little or no mention of them on EV forums. Yes, EVs are better technology. I love my '11 LEAF, but I want to have options when the time comes to retire it. without government support we never would have gotten this far, but the tide is turning.

post,65vp74,,"Tesla ($TSLA) Units, Revenue, and Stock Price projection thru 2025","Over the last three years I posted two models that attempted to look into the future of Tesla and the correlating price.

I've updated the sheet to include all the different changes/events that have happened in the last 3 years to come up with a more inclusive (and complete) projection of TSLA thru 2025 based on the latest guidance from the company. To summarize:

* Tesla is guiding for 500k car units sold in 2018, 1m by 2020 (model reflects a more conservative approach at 80% of guidance).
* Since 3 years ago along with its purchase of Solar City, Tesla has announced new vehicles and products that it will be adding to its catalog. Including Model 3 (mid-size $35k sedan), these are Model Y (mid-size SUV), a Pick Up truck, a Semi Truck, a ""Mini Bus"", a solar roof, solar panels, battery storage, and a ride sharing business. All of these can be found in Tesla's [Master Plan, Part Deux post](https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux).
* Tesla is projecting its Energy division to be as large as its car/transportation division, with an S curve growth (i.e. exponential) in the coming months.

Based on these, I've create a yearly chart of my projected units sold by category, revenue, and expected GM%. Quick note:

* I'm projecting the Tesla Freight (semi truck) and Bus to be a service model, not one where companies are expected to purchase the truck or bus outright (i.e. Tesla becomes a 3PL provider with fully autonomous trucks). I've modeled these on 100% margin on an expected profit amount that I think they'll be able to draw from each unit on a yearly basis.
* I have no idea what the per-unit price of the storage business extrapolates to, so I attempted to model it based on a % of total business. Don't pay too much attention to the unit figures under the storage business.

I'm setting a price target of $733 using 2021 figure for revenue of $91.7bn. You can use this same exercise for any of the figures on the model (i.e.",2582,True,1492437592.0,2017-04-17 15:59:52,231,174,farzyness,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/65vp74/tesla_tsla_units_revenue_and_stock_price/,True,0.82,2017,both,search,False,False,0,
comment,65vp74,65vp74,,"Here are your problems:

You assume a gross margin of 20% for a mass market car. Honda/Toyota/GM are around 5%, I believe. Tesla won't be better.

Your growth assumptions are waaaaay to fast. No possible way that Model III sells 270k next year, or 30k for this year. Even the most bullish analysts only have like 2k Model III for this year.

You assume 25% GM on grid storage, which is currently negative.

Solar Roofs will not be a $36B market. I doubt there's even that much market for high-end roofs period in the USA. Solar roofs are not comparable to regular roofs, only very expensive slate/Tuscan/what-have-you tile..

No one will buy a Tesla pick-up. The market isn't there. Towing capacity is important for pick-ups (that's what they're for), and towing anything with the Model X drastically decreases range (to about a third or so). No way anyone will try anything with an EV pick-up, like taking a boat to the lake. Simply won't have the energy to make it there and back, unless you're talking a lake ~ 30 mins away.

I think the rest of your projections are WAY too rosy, but those are the few that are indisputably true. I'm not even bringing up the fact that Tesla does not have a lead in autonomous driving (California data, AP 2.0 all confirm), and thus the whole Tesla Freight thing is bunk.",1308,False,1492440780.0,2017-04-17 16:53:00,79,0,[deleted],investing,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/65vp74/tesla_tsla_units_revenue_and_stock_price/dgdknoq/,True,,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,dgdknoq

comment,67dmwy,67dmwy,,"The piece of the puzzle you are missing out about the tech giants is their habits of buying out all the latest trending techs which allows them to continue to grow. And it is at a level that just isn't true for other sectors.

Facebook the website isn't what it used to be but instagram is as big as ever, guess who owns it? Whatsapp is another one they own which took over the text/msging industry. Then Oculus Rift (which at one point was THE virtual reality product) is also owned by Facebook. This trend will always continue with tech, tech industry is well aware of how new tech will make their old tech obsolete (they have witnessed it in action in the 90s/early 2000s). So much so that it is imperative that they change with the time.

Thus we cant treat Tech companies as this one single product selling entity anymore because they always acquire companies (that might not even reflect the initial businesses, i.e. virtual reality in Facebook's case or MSFT owning linkedin)

If not that, then they simply venture out on their own to create new businesses. (i.e Microsoft/Sony making a gaming console. Tesla that was initially a car company is now making solar panels for homes, or my favourite, amazon a distribution company venturing out and making one of the most successful cloud tech, AWS). This makes all of these tech giants of today different from the previous ones like AOL/MySpace who didn't do this.

I agree on Apple though, fuck em.",1509,True,1493126655.0,2017-04-25 15:24:15,5,0,kaezermusik,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/67dmwy/my_longterm_stock_portfolio/dgq5z0s/,True,,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,dgq5z0s

post,689t8c,,Upcoming ways to watch Elon Musk's interview from TED 2017,"X-post from [SpaceXLounge](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/6876oi/upcoming_ways_to_watch_elons_interview_from_ted/) because this sub was instantly deleting my posts for awhile.

So without further ado, from an event organizer I emailed:

> Elon Musk didn't give a talk, but just gave the interview with our CEO Chris Anderson. It covered such a wide range of topics  – really fascinating stuff, and put a cap on the conference's theme, The Future You. The atmosphere in the auditorium was electric!

Anyway these are the possible ways to watch the interview with Elon at TED 2017, soonest to longest from now:

* 1) Someone posts an unofficial version online given Elon's high profile. I think this is somewhat unlikely since TED runs a tight ship but who knows

* 2) [TED Cinema Experience](https://tedcinema.com): **This Sunday**, many theaters will be showing a $17 2-hour highlight reel from TED 2017. The interview with Elon is specifically mentioned in the description and about half of it will be shown. From the description on TED Cinema: *""The program will include a new interview with Elon Musk about what an exciting future looks like, among other inspiring and insightful TED Talks and performances from the week""*

* 3) [TED Live](https://tedlive.ted.com/webcasts/2017): Available for viewing **June 7th**, Pay $25 to watch all of TED 2017 Day 5 including Elon's interview. This is the only thing that I'm sure will definitely be the entire 30 minute interview

* 4) [TED YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/TEDtalksDirector): Wait until it is posted publicly on the TED YouTube channel. This is expected to have a delay of about **5 to 6 months from now** based on the delays of TED 2016 and it's not guaranteed to be the full thing or even be uploaded at all. It's likely but some TED speakers never make it to the channel

Today, the pre-7:1 split equivalent share price is approaching $1,100 each.  So of course, the guy who got in @$500 didn't profit as much as the guy who got in at $200, but even the guy who got in at the then All Time High of $700 has still profited handsomely.

If you like TSLA and believe in its long to super-long term future (like me), get in. When this thing is trading at $500+, you won't care whether you got it @ $287 or $313.  But it is expensive, so unless you're throwing mega cash and buying 1000 shares, your actual dollar profit will probably take a little while to accumulate.  And I would say the 100+% gain in the last 12 months is not likely to occur again.  But that's ludicrous, that will be studied for years to come.

So if you want in for the long haul, watch the stock and wait for a little pullback.  It can't go up every single day, just try to find a deal to make yourself feel good about your investment, and lock it in a time capsule and come back and check on it in 10 years.

If you just want action, try TSLA options if you're up to it.  I've done very well on certain moves, very poor on others.  But it's highly volatile and is a polarizing company, which means people love it or hate it and the stock price moves wildly.

# 1. What's Delphi do?

Delphi Automotive is a global technology company serving the automotive sector. The Company designs and manufactures vehicle components, and provides electrical and electronic, powertrain and active safety technology solutions to the global automotive and commercial vehicle markets. 

If you look at their client list... it's a who's who of the auto market and only one customers is over 10% of sales, GM. For 2016 the split was: GM 14%; Volkswagen 8%; Ford 6%; Fiat Chrysler 5%; GM China 5%; Daimler 5%; Peugeot Citroen 5%; Hyundai 3%; Geely 3%; and Toyota 2%. Though I wonder why there is no Renault, Honda, BMW or Tesla? Suppose you can't serve everyone!

From a sales perspective its 37% North America, 2% South, 35% Europe&MEA and 26% Asia-Pac. So perhaps there's room to grow in Asia?

## How are they doing, number wise?

At first look the data looks nice, but that is partially 'cos of a big acquisition in Dec 2015 and another in Oct 2012. 

|Metric|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|

|EPS | $4.59 | $5.06 | $4.48 | $3.89 | $3.33|

Management themselves are very happy to offer up ""Adjusted"" figures ignoring discontinued operations, papering over restructuring costs, one-off project costs, etc, etc. I hate that...but for now, let's park that concern.

Perhaps I shouldn't be too harsh, dividends are rising.

""If not, then you should consider that other announcement I mentioned: namely, Delphi Automotive PLC's decision to spin off its powertrain business. This division serves the established automotive industry producing vehicles powered by the internal combustion engine. The larger, remaining business will focus on electrification, sensors and software.

In other words, Delphi, a company originally spun out of GM, is now letting go of the old technology so it can focus on its faster-growing business.It doesn't take a hedge-fund manager to work out that Delphi has been looking at Tesla's soaring valuation and hopes the split will inject some exuberance into its own stock -- which jumped by 11 percent on Wednesday.

For those who believe in Musk's vision but not Tesla's valuation, they may want to consider the fact that Delphi's business focused on electrification and autonomy makes $12 billion of revenue and actually turns an operating profit.

**It also, crucially, *serves the entire automotive industry's* efforts to reinvent vehicles,** not just Tesla.

post,6eh8no,,More expensive to use electricity for plug-in hybrid?,"I have a Toyota Prius Prime rental this month and just doing some quick math, I think it's more expensive to run the car on electricity than to just put gas in it from an ***energy consumption standpoint***.

I live in the SF Bay Area and PG&E ranges between $0.17 and $0.50/kWh for residential rates and public charging stations are similar or $1/hour. The Prime takes about 2 hours on a Level 2 charger and 5.5 hours on a Level 1 charger. Based on a battery capacity of 8.8kWh and an average range of 22 miles, it comes out to between $0.068/mile and $0.20/mile depending on where I plug in. Gas is averaging about $3/gallon as we head into summer and assuming hybrid-only average of 50 MPG, it comes out to $0.06/mile. 

I understand that the EV-only mode is much more efficient at 133 MPGe, but what bothers me is that I would be paying more than twice for the same amount energy in terms of [gallon of gasoline equivalent] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline_gallon_equivalent) at $5.678/gallon and up. 

Is there an error in my math or am I overthinking this? I'm excluding free destination charging (e.g. parking garages, etc.) because at this point they seem to be the exception rather than the norm. I have a reservation for Tesla Model 3, but it seems like it might be significantly higher in terms of fuel costs.

In terms of the car itself, the Prime is way better than the regular Gen IV Prius. I took it up to Mount Tamalpais over the weekend with some friends and it handles the curves on Highway 1 surprisingly well, remaining planted even with three people on board. It's definitely not a BMW, but I think the heavier weight of the battery pack helps make it feel more solid. Overall, the reaction I've gotten from a lot of people is more ""wow"" instead of the ""ew' I got from the normal Gen IV Prius.

comment,6g8fje,6g8fje,,"Bullshit.

The math doesn't work. This isn't really feasible except for very lightly used superchargers. It depends on where you are and how well it is oriented, but a solar panel will get about 1kWh per day average across the year. And the panel is about 1.5 square meters. So that's 0.66 kWh per square meter.

A Tesla might take about 60kWh per charge. This is about 3/4 of the full capacity of the car. That means to charge one car per day takes 90 square meters of panels. And that's with 100% conversion efficiency.

If you you have 5 stalls and they each charge 4 cars a day, that's 1800 square meters of panels, almost 2 square kilometers [edit: it isn't 2 square kilometers, see respondents below].

And this is all being somewhat optimistic. It doesn't account for conversion losses (the charger really would be about 93% efficient, not 100). It doesn't account for cloudy days. It doesn't account for the fact that in winter the cells don't produce as much as average so you need even more of them.

It's just not realistic for 'almost all' Superchargers to disconnect from the grid and go solar+battery. Sure, you can do it with lightly used ones in open spaces where you can get space to install a lot of panels. But almost all is not just a pipe dream, it's an out and out lie.

The superchargers are able to charge in 15 minutes bc of the high voltage and high current.

Additionally batteries can not just output massive current like the grid does instantaneously. There's ramp rate that the batteries need.

Isambard Kingdom Brunel FRS (/ˈɪzəmˌbɑːd bruːˈnɛl/; 9 April 1806 – 15 September 1859), was an English mechanical and civil engineer who is considered ""one of the most ingenious and prolific figures in engineering history"", ""one of the 19th century engineering giants"", and ""one of the greatest figures of the Industrial Revolution, [who] changed the face of the English landscape with his groundbreaking designs and ingenious constructions"". Brunel built dockyards, the Great Western Railway, a series of steamships including the first propeller-driven transatlantic steamship, and numerous important bridges and tunnels. His designs revolutionised public transport and modern engineering.

Though Brunel's projects were not always successful, they often contained innovative solutions to long-standing engineering problems. During his career, Brunel achieved many engineering firsts, including assisting in the building of the first tunnel under a navigable river and development of SS Great Britain, the first propeller-driven, ocean-going, iron ship, which, when built in 1843, was the largest ship ever built.

post,6i671g,,Tesla is starting Model 3 battery cell production at Gigafactory 1 ‘right now’,"Tesla has confirmed that it started production of the new Model 3 battery cell at Gigafactory 1 in Nevada over the weekend – an important step toward launching the production of the Model 3.

The new battery cells are believed to be key to Tesla achieving the necessary cost reductions that enable the Model 3’s $35,000 starting price tag before incentive.

comment,6i671g,6i671g,,"Lithium is one of many elements in ""lithium-ion"" batteries. It is actually one of the smaller elements by quantity in the battery. The other elements are the elements that Tesla and others are innovating on which is why the naming emphasizes the different elements that make these batteries unique from other Li-ion batteries. Cobalt for example is hard to get and expensive but needed in batteries. So it makes sense to find ways to use less cobalt. The Alumium Oxide coating is helpful with the energy transfer process and heat management (I think, could be wrong about that last part). 

So basically the new naming is just to emphasize the changes over standard chemistry to distinguish between one version of Li-ion from another.

If they can commercially deliver on their claims of 25-30% price reduction per KW/H I think we will have witnessed a true step forward in energy tech.

Well just think, GM has all the cards in their hand to beat out Tesla if they really focused on it:

* They have enough money to indefinitely take a leader loss on their EVs and beat out Tesla.

* Tesla is having major quality control problems because of their need to save costs. Because they can't take a leader loss like GM can, they're going to have to cheapen their vehicle if they actually expect to sell at 35 k.

* GM can overnight start a multi-million dollar ad campaign to popularize their Bolt. Tesla does have a cult following, but they won't have the cash to out compete GM should GM decide to really throw some advertising behind their EVs/

* Within the year they'll have the capacity to sell as many Bolts as there are orders.

* Tesla's customer service sucks. They are so behind on production people who get into accidents have to wait months to get parts to fix their cars. This will be a huge turn off for the average person and will be a problem GM won't have.

* Tesla can't afford a major recall on their vehicle if they fuck up.

* Tesla is going to have to compete with GM's second, or even third, generation of Bolts. GM will have more time to iron out any problems the Bolt has. If it turns out the Bolt is simply cheaper and more reliable than the M3, the average person will just go for the Bolt.",1423,False,1497907379.0,2017-06-19 23:22:59,9,0,CommunismWillTriumph,investing,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/6i6hif/tesla_is_starting_model_3_battery_cell_production/dj4h9n3/,True,,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,dj4h9n3

China will do what they do to Apple and most other western companies.  Completely steal the tech, design and IP for one generation of vehicles and undercut Tesla.  Not a terrible development but counting on China for growth in the tech space has been a mixed to negative bag in general.  It's very hard to penetrate the Chinese market in a substantial way because the deck is almost always stacked against you.  

It would be far from surprising if in another year or two BYD or some other domestic company starts producing cars 95% similar to the Model S and Model X.

# 1. What do they make?

Magna International is a global automotive supplier, HQed in Canada with over 300 manufacturing plants and sales in 30+ countries.

The Company's products include producing body, chassis, exterior, seating, powertrain, electronic, active driver assistance, vision, closure, and roof systems and modules, as well as vehicle engineering and contract manufacturing. 

* The US and Canada is over 50% of sales where their clients include BMW, Daimler, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai-Kia, Mazda, PACCAR, Renault-Nissan, Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen. 
* Europe's over 30% of sales and there's a similar list of clients, but also includes Geely, PSA Peugeot Citroën, Renault-Nissan, and Tata Motors.
* In Asia they serve the usual suspects, and: Chery Automobile, First Automobile Works, and Great Wall Automobile.

So it's a who's who of the motor industry! 

But let's compare there concentration of sales with global sales:

|Metric|% of Magna sales|% global share|
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|GM | 20% | 8% |
|Ford | 16% | 7% |
|Fiat Chrysler | 15% | 5% |
|Daimler | 12% | 2% |
|Volkswagen | 10% | 11% |
|BMW | 10% | 3% |
|Others | 17% | 63% |

In fact, despite the client list they are way behind in sales to five of the top 10: Toyota, Hyundai, Nissan, Honda and Suzuki. Not a surprise given the small sales % in Asia. Perhaps, here lies the biggest opportunity?

And if we look at the recent performance, the top line's pretty rocky, though that does include a major disposal in 2015.",6245,True,1498590732.0,2017-06-27 21:12:12,47,6,shane_stockflare,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/6juzju/stockaday_is_magna_electric_mga/,True,0.89,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Tesla's overarching goal was to make electric cars affordable, which would be possible (somewhat) with the Model 3. July is when the Model 3 will slowly reach the consumers, but will it be enough to wow us. I believe the reason that the Tesla Model S and X didn't quite hit the analysts' numbers was because people are holding off and waiting for the Model 3. Ultimately, Tesla wants us to love the Model 3 so much that we will buy into the whole Tesla ecosystem. If the reviews rave about the Model 3, stocks are sure to rise.

Tesla is like Apple in a sense where their technologies technically work with third party items but who would risk it? Would you buy a third party macbook or iPhone charger if that charger could potentially kill your product? No, of course you'll buy the manufacturer's chargers. And if Tesla is so good at making electric cars, wouldn't that be the case for their batteries and solar roofs too? I'm sure people will be sold on that idea. Their houses would basically be Tesla branded at that point, with Tesla solar tile roof, Tesla house batteries and a Tesla in the garage. I'm sure it'll sync up nicely, almost like your iPhone on a Mac.

Now what if the Model 3 release failed and was filled with issues? Orders will surely drop, people who have already deposited money will surely back out when they believe it is a poor investment. The idea of the Tesla ecosystem will be ruined (maybe saved by Model Y?), stocks will surely plummet as people lose interest. 

Tesla is the company that made electric cars cool, they shook the automotive industry forcing them to make EV varieties as well. And if the Model 3 surpasses expectations, I'm sure it will replace all other vehicles in that price range. It will be the ""Not your daddy's entry level luxury sedan"".",2300,True,1499325728.0,2017-07-06 09:22:08,3,8,HungryPotatoe,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/6lk733/why_i_believe_july_is_make_or_break_for_tesla/,True,0.57,2017,both,search,False,False,0,
comment,6lk733,6lk733,,"I mentioned this in another post, but Tesla's tough to figure out, buy or short. Too many unknowns for me to make any moves, could be a company that skyrockets to the moon (literally) or just fizzles out - very binary. Competing car companies (on the vehicle end), the solar landscape (for their SCTY subsidiary), and the PowerWall are all industries on the cusp of either massive massive success or utter failure (and will be introduced later). I have a feeling they'll do well since the economics are really getting there (no gas, no maintenance, quick ROI for solar all great).

In any case, Tesia is not going to be showing steadying and predictability anytime soon, so I'm staying out! Would rather hit a 100% upside with 80% certainty than a 1000% upside with 10% certainty. Some investors will probably choose the latter and might come out extremely ""prophetable"" but that success is not clear to me at the moment.",921,False,1499340534.0,2017-07-06 13:28:54,10,0,meeni131,investing,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/6lk733/why_i_believe_july_is_make_or_break_for_tesla/djul2se/,True,,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,djul2se

post,6m9zyi,,"I did the math & was surprised: On the current US grid, P100D is not much greener than a VW Golf","Facts:

1. [VW Golf does 36 miles/gallon on the highway](http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2017-volkswagen-golf-in-depth-model-review-2017-volkswagen-golf-fuel-economy-review-car-and-driver-page-3).
2. [A gallon on petrol produces 20 pounds of CO_2](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/contentIncludes/co2_inc.htm) !!!
3. The means the VW Golf does 0.56 pounds of CO_2 / mile.
4. [Tesla P100D does 315 miles on 100KWh, or 0.32KWh/mile](https://bgr.com/2017/01/20/tesla-model-s-vs-model-x-100d-range/).
5. [The average CO_2 output of US electrical grid is 7.03 × 10^-4 metric tons CO2 / kWh](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gases-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references) or 1.5 pounds/KWh.
6. Therefore the amount of CO_2 equivalent a P100D outputs or 0.49 pounds of CO_2 / mile.

Conclusion:

* VW Golf: 0.56 pounds CO_2/mile

* Tesla P100D: 0.49 pounds CO_2/mile

As the grid gets greener (e.g. replace Coal with Gas, more renewables, etc) the amount of CO_2 equivalent for the Tesla drops. But for now, on average, the big P100D is about as dirty as the small VW Golf, which is way way dirtier than I expected.

If the Model 3 does 215 miles on 50KWh battery (we don't know for sure yet), it'll output 73% of the S' CO_2, or 0.36 pounds CO_2/mile, which is 36% cleaner than the VW Golf. Only 36% cleaner.

Note this calculation neglects the CO_2 ""price"" of collecting and refining petrol, as well as the CO_2 ""price"" of collecting coal & gas for the grid.",1474,False,1499634620.0,2017-07-09 23:10:20,0,21,shaim2,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/6m9zyi/i_did_the_math_was_surprised_on_the_current_us/,True,0.41,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,6n7e3h,,True Value Investing: Dividend Payout Ratio,"The dividend payout ratio (DPR) is the percentage of net income that is paid out as dividends to shareholders.

In order to calculate the true value of a stock, you should examine the dividend payout ratio of the company and industry historically. 

Ex. Apple in 2016. Gross profit, 82.72B. Net profit, 45.69B. Dividends, 12.3B paid out to 5.39B shares; 2.28 per share. That amounts to a dividend payout ratio of about 27%.

Combine your predicted dividend payout ratio with your predicted net earnings of the company to calculate your estimated holding return on the stock. This is where a lower EPS is not so bad if the expected DPR is excellent. Accordingly, a higher EPS on a strong company is not so good if their expected DPR is poor.

Ex. Tesla stands today at a stock price of $323 with an outstanding share count of 164M. Taking Ford Motors' 2016 earnings/dividend performance as a benchmark, suppose that Tesla reaches a similar net profit and dividend payout ratio in 10 years. Then, Tesla's 2026 projected net profit of 4.6B with a 30% DPR yields $8.4 per share (paltry 2.6% true return value).

There do come times where growth companies valuation because so optimistic that is completely unattainable.

Do you expect Telsa to grow even larger than ford?  Are you happy with them reaching a place were you could get a 2.6% dividend?  

One limitation is you should consider share by back in addition to dividend yield.

post,6nrov8,,Open request to the electric vehicle industry: Make us an electric 4wheel drive.,"Hello. 

I am a motoring enthusiast. I fit into a relatively large niche of the motoring enthusiast community in that I am mainly interested in off-road driving. Although I enjoy watching car races; F1's, V8 Supercars, top fuel drag races, drift races, I even geek out a bit on the big street rods and I don't mind going to car shows and show'n'shine events, I don't own a big horsepower car and I probably never will. The main type of motoring I am about is off road driving. I LOVE the sense of freedom you get when you just turn off the side of a road and hook into the bush, or cruising over wide open sand dunes. I love seeing how far I can get. I love conquering mountains, even if it means I have to park up somewhere in the scrub and hike the rest of the way. I love getting stuck and having to pull out the winch. I love off-road touring, to me its the purest form of motoring - taking the freedom that *having* a motor vehicle gives you to the absolute extreme. Club events, hanging out with a bunch of other like minded people/families, cooking up a barbeque somewhere out in the wilderness, a secluded swimming hole that not many people ever get to see. Its really incredible. My point is, I love motoring, but I don't really care about going fast. 

Some of you might have seen the post on the front page recently about the Top Gear crew scripting/manufacturing a breakdown of the Tesla Roadster without even ever having seen or driven it ... As a motoring enthusiast I was not surprised at all by this. Appalled yes, surprised not in the least.. In the community circles of which I am a member, electric vehicles aren't cool. But not only are they not cool, the advent of electric vehicles is seen as somewhat of a threat to our lifestyle. 

Me personally, I don't see EV's as a threat to my lifestyle, because what I'm into is a bit different. I don't care so much about the grunts and rumbles you get when you open up the carby on a big V8.",5451,True,1500278197.0,2017-07-17 09:56:37,21,28,petehehe,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/6nrov8/open_request_to_the_electric_vehicle_industry/,True,0.95,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,6op4w4,,Investing Philosophy,"For the past year, I've been building a new web application that tracks and analyzes my stock portfolio.  I know there are a lot of tools out there, but I've never really loved any of them.  So I set out to build my own.  The thing is, it's based on my investing philosophy, and I'd like to get your feedback on my philosophy because that will help shape the web application as I continue to develop it.  Please read on...

As a personal investor, every time you invest money in the stock market, you essentially choose one of two options:

Option #1 is to find a great company and purchase some stock.  You monitor the company and decide when to sell based on company performance, market conditions, changes in leadership, the company’s financials, and so much more…  Generally, that’s us – we are personal investors.

Option #2 is to simply buy a low-cost index fund or ETF that guarantees a return essentially equal to the market or whatever benchmark you choose (most commonly the S&P 500).

Why do some people choose option #2?  It turns out, those benchmarks outperform most mutual funds and many individual investors, and they don’t require any of the work involved in managing your own portfolio! 

So, here’s the thing: it’s easy to buy shares of an index fund or ETF and match the market’s returns (letting your portfolio grow on autopilot) but it’s quite difficult to actually beat the market. 

Nevertheless, that doesn’t stop us individual investors from finding that diamond in the rough…that next great company that will change the world, crush its competitors, and enrich our personal portfolios.

*My point is this:  Individual investors are not just trying to make money.  The goal is to make more money than what an index fund or ETF would return...the goal is to beat the market.  We want validation that all this hard work is paying off, that we're making the right decisions, and we are indeed outperforming the S&P 500 (or whatever benchmark you prefer).",2393,True,1500655479.0,2017-07-21 18:44:39,2,7,BuckM11,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/6op4w4/investing_philosophy/,True,0.75,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,6qv3oy,,Electric Car Culture,"So, i was wondering what the electric car craze will do to car culture. Personally, i don't drive, but my job involves thinking about car and car culture more or less all day. Since i do not have any real inside experience, i would like to hear the opinion of this subreddit on what car culture will mean when the electric motor finally takes over. 50 years from now, will we marvel at restored classic teslas and will we drive around in Nissan Leaf-Beaters we got off Craigslist for 500 currency? Or will the car just become a commodity that can be disposed of every few years? Depending on answers, i might process various bits into an article.

post,6rcpch,,Tesla Plans to use Mobile Repairs for Vehicle Service,"From the Tesla earnings call, servicing the expected volume of Model 3's in addition to their current offerings was brought up, this is Tesla's solution;

""How does Tesla plan to service the high volume of Model 3s? Mobile Repair Service.

80% of repairs will not require a lift. For these customers, Tesla brings the service to them with mobile service trucks. Tesla will fix their vehicles while they’re at work or at home. This method of service is convenient for the customer and cost efficient for Tesla.""

I wanted to see what everyone thought about this. To me it sounds like Tesla is going to try & avoid physical expansion to cut cost & try to limit cars coming into the location unless a lift is needed. I discussed this in the tesla subreddit & my key concerns are that most repairs will be difficult or impossible depending on where the car is (garages, tight parking, hills, etc) or the weather conditions if outside (rain, snow, cold, etc) & service time will be slower (driving to multiple cars, slower time to repair outside vs in shop).",1053,False,1501771062.0,2017-08-03 16:37:42,2,2,Axxion89,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/6rcpch/tesla_plans_to_use_mobile_repairs_for_vehicle/,True,0.6,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

I have owned a few 911’s so coming down in size isn’t a concern... it’s more about the other finer details.

I am a performance nut though; I had an all-too-brief ownership experience with a B7 Audi RS 4 I took on a number of HDPE trips & autocrosses, and I've loved wrenching on / modifying cars since I was in junior high. I've been trying to convince myself to pick up a used P85 / P85+ for about a year now (with the occasional ""see how far I could stretch the budget"" dream of a P85D), but decided not to pull the trigger until after the Model 3 final reveal - just in case. Many reviews of the P85 / P85+ / P85D all mentioned it was crazy fast in a straight line, and not too shabby in the corners but that the car still felt large and heavy. Test drives I've done confirm this (I've driven a 75D and a P100D Model S, as well as a 100D Model X); while the Model S feels great, it definitely doesn't attempt to hide its heft very well in the corners the way my RS 4 did. 

After reading the glowing Motor Trend first drive review:
""....to mention body roll is to have already said too much about it. Sure, that battery is low, way down under the floor. But unlike the aluminum Model S, the Tesla Model 3 is composed of steel, too, and this car’s glass ceiling can’t be helping the center of gravity’s height. Nearly-nil body roll? Magic, I’m telling you. Magic. And this is the single-motor, rear-wheel-drive starting point. The already boggled mind boggles further at the mention of Dual Motor and Ludicrous.""

Humanity begins to colonize Mars, everyone has neural laces, and we're all whisked around in a combination of self-driving cars, Hyperloops, and electric jets. He becomes the world's richest man and secures a his place in history, beloved by all.

-----

My question is whether his name could catch on as a popular baby name near or after the end of his life. There's been increased popularity from fictional characters (Elsa from Frozen) but I'm not sure any real person has ever caused a *significant* increase in baby name popularity, especially an industrialist or entrepreneur. Maybe I'm just not thinking about it enough but it seems like most names of admirable historic figures are either generic enough that you wouldn't know who they were named after or antiquated.

Elon, though biblical in origin, is short and iconic and I could see it catching on. The only non-celebrity real-life example I can think of is Hitler but that kind of had the opposite effect...

post,6sgrpq,,Tesla S South Carolina Delivery Experience,"I also posted this on TMC, thought it might be useful for anyone in SC since we don't have a dealership and there are some nuances that are different from a traditional car purchase.

I received delivery of my 2017 S75 RWD late last week and wanted to share my experience for anyone in South Carolina that may be looking at purchasing a Tesla. Despite having some large metropolitan areas, South Carolina does not have a Tesla dealer (gallery or service center). I'm not sure why this is but it may be due in part that BMW has a huge manufacturing presence here or it may be about the direct sales model....there are far more educated people on that topic and that isn't the purpose of my post. I am only speculating.

I spent the majority of my adult life begging my wife to let me get the Model S and eventually I won out. She pressed the button to confirm the deposit online, and told me that in her mind she was buying my silence. By that she meant that now that we are actually getting one, I can no longer give her a Tesla fact every chance I get nor can I ""inception"" her by making her watch youtube videos about how awesome they are right before we fall asleep each night. 

Anyways, I have been a Model 3 reservation for over a year but I kept coming back to the Model S. In my own personal opinion, I like the fact that the S has been around for several years and assumed they have worked a lot of the kinks out. I personally believe Tesla will change the world with the Model 3 but there's something to be said for the look and the size of the S as well as its long production history. I initially went with a custom build S 75, red with no PUP black leather and the subzero package. I place the deposit in late June and the delivery date was late July. I was good with this because I know they're trying to focus on the model 3 and what's another month when you've been dying to have one for years?

The odds are stacked against the fact that we’ll be doing in 20 years what we are doing today. Do you remember the days before the internet? It was legit, 20 years ago! When was the last time you saw a horse and buggy or an employed horse shoe maker. We hear the myth of the coal miner, but I know a hell of a lot more opportunities in solar.
Can you imagine the technology we’re going to have in 20 years? We won’t have to drive our own cars. Do you think that is unbelievable? My buddy’s Tesla already drives itself! Tesla is planning to release a semi-truck in the next few years. Are you a professional truck driver? I’d start training for an alternative career now so you are prepared when it happens.
That’s the point I want to address in this article. In order to be prepared for the future, you have to prepare for the future! Coal miners know they are getting regulated out by two factors. The first is that there is a massive consumer shift happening today with the market place demanding more renewable options as the price continues to decrease. The second is that you are digging up a natural resource that there is only a finite amount of. I mean, you are already blowing up mountains to get what you need. How long can we do this before we can’t? In a world where nothing is infinite, we should prepare ourselves in the event that finite happens. We lose a job. Our skillset isn’t one that is required anymore in the marketplace. We’re getting out paid, out played and overstayed by some kid out of school that’s more in touch with what the consumer generation wants and needs.
This is why, the most important skill you can teach yourself in life, is how to learn.

post,6squec,,My electric-car fanboy father is having even more fun driving my fart-canned Honda than I am!,"Last weekend, [I bought a 1993 Honda Prelude SR-V](http://imgur.com/a/3D3QB) as a cheap daily with some character for my upcoming years in school. Insurance was killing me on my 08 Civic despite a perfect record, and the Prelude, being older, is better in that regard.

I was pretty pleased with the purchase, everything seems in order and there doesn't seem to be any major issues considering it's a 24-year old Honda, most of which have lived tough lives. I'm working on an island without use of a car, so it's parked at home for the summer. My dad, however, is even more pleased with my purchase.

See, about 25 years ago he had just graduated from university with a bachelors in computing science and decided to treat himself with an upgrade from his 1979 Pontiac Sunbird. He was comparing the Toyota Celica and the Honda Prelude, and ended up buying a Celica as it was more practical. The Prelude continued to be his ""dream"" for some time.

Fast forward to today. My dad isn't a huge car guy per se, although I am thankful he puts up with my constant drivel about cars. He enjoys alternative energies as a hobby and was one of the first Tesla Model S owners in Canada. [So imagine my surprise when I get this set of images from him.](http://i.imgur.com/LmozdU0.png)

He plans to take my car in to work a few times while I'm away to ""keep the battery charged"" and I feel is just having a blast, making me miss a nice back road even more. [My mom isn't having as much fun on their excursions.](https://streamable.com/drklu)

comment,73w0be,73w0be,,"I've been wrestling with this question for a while. Here is my jumble of thoughts. LONG TERM
-In general, electric engines need far less maintenance than combustion ones so car makers should make far les money on the parts market...in theory. However, as we have seen from the enlightening ""Tesla helps out hurricane evacuation"" situation, it is all but certain car manufacturers will find ways of gaining more money in the same way game developers make money off of DLC.
-There will be an increase in parts compatibility between different models/makes and more parts can be made of cheap materials (plastics/composites) simply due to the dynamic of electric engines, this will decrease production costs of vehicles which in theory will eventually make automobiles far more affordable than at any point in history. Owning a vehicle will be easier for a lot of people on a global scale, especially in the 3rd world (double the convenience if they have electricity but no easy access to a gas station/cheap fuel). 

Overall, in my non-expert analysis, I would say the car industry is approaching a new gold rush...possibly surpassing the significance of the model T. Car manufacturers will find innovative ways of squeezing money out of the consumer in the most modern of ways and more people will have access to vehicles. As soon as electric cars have a standard 400+ mile range (it will happen in 5 years) everyone with a gas vehicle will start mulling over a replacement. Fuck petroleum.

post,74kohb,,IKEA buys startup TaskRabbit : What’s the next BHAG startup deal going to be?,"IKEA, the world’s largest home furnishing retailer recently announced that it plans to acquire 100% of the shares in TaskRabbit, Inc., an on-demand services platform startup.

To some, this merger deal sounded comically counter-intuitive: IKEA, perhaps the largest do-it-yourself store in the world is buying a Silicon Valley startup that offers small tasks to users including lazy folks who don’t want to be Doing-It Yourself !

The synergies in this deal now seem obvious. And the financials of the deal are unclear. However,  one can only begin to imagine Big Hairy Audacious Goal (BHAG) synergies in other areas too; aassuming the deal consultants are able to sell it to corporate executives:

- A hotel giant like Mariott, Wyndham or IHG buying AirBnb?

- Rental car giant like Hertz or Avis buying Uber?
  
- General motors buying Tesla?
  
- IBM buying Google’s cloud division?
  
- others…..?


Q> Is it time to invest in such startups too?

post,76frgb,,My CPO experience and home charging installation,"I placed a deposit on a CPO 2014 Model S 60 late last Friday night (10/6) and took delivery yesterday (10/13). Overall I had a very positive experience and we love the car!

**Specs**

* 2014 60kWh Model S listed for $50,600
* Grey Metallic Paint
* All glass pano roof
* 19” Silver Cyclone Wheels
* 19” Michelin Primacy Tire Upgrade
* Free supercharging
* Smart air suspension
* Subzero weather package
* Black Nappa Leather w/ Piano Black
* Tech Package

Things I didn’t expect but were included on delivery

* Parcel Shelf
* Parking sensors! I thought I read the early 2014s didn’t have these. Mine does

**Ordering**

After last week’s announcement that it would be 6-8 weeks until non-employees could start designing their Model 3s I somewhat impulsively decided to buy a used Model S instead. I found a 2014 S 60 in LA with no transportation fee to San Diego. Upon ordering my sales advisor told me that the car had already completed reconditioning and was ready to be transported to San Diego. After that initial interaction he didn’t respond to any of my questions throughout the week. My delivery specialist was great though.

**Financing and Insurance**

I financed through Tech CU. I got quotes from my local credit union and a few others but their terms were the best. My insurance is going from $60 per month (old Honda with no collision coverage) to $190 per month.

**Fees and Down Payment**

The DMV fees were a little higher than expected. Sales tax and registration fees were an additional 9.2% on the sale price. For the down payment, I was happy to learn I could make multiple payments from a few online savings accounts. I had been saving for my Model 3 in an Ally account with 1.2% APY and recently transferred some money to a CapitalOne 360 account to collect a sign up bonus. Once the delivery appointment was scheduled the payment option was available and I paid on Wednesday.

**Delivery**

I put together a detailed checklist to go through during delivery.",4403,True,1508026234.0,2017-10-15 02:10:34,22,4,GreenBSTRD,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/76frgb/my_cpo_experience_and_home_charging_installation/,True,0.85,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Full text below :
> This was supposed to be Tesla’s moment of triumph. The California electric car company had confidently predicted it would be pumping out 5,000 of its mass market Model 3 vehicles each week by the end of 2017. That volume would allow it to move out of its high-end niche and compete head to head with traditional automakers.

> Instead, Tesla has been beset by a series of production snags — some workers are having to build battery packs by hand, parts have been delayed because of late design changes, and production lines are frequently halted for quality inspections. As a result, it was only able to produce 260 Model 3 vehicles in the third quarter, and has pushed back its 5,000 car per week goal to the end of March. The company also reported a bigger than expected third-quarter loss.

> Tesla insists that these are merely teething problems as it remakes car manufacturing from the ground up. “There are no fundamental issues with Model 3 production or its supply chain, and we are confident in addressing the manufacturing bottleneck issues in the near-term,” a spokesman said.

> The company proudly noted that some of its manufacturing lines — including the seat assembly and paint shop — have “demonstrated a manufacturing ability” to handle 1,000 cars a week, and others have demonstrated “burst builds of about 500 a week”.

> That still puts its factories in California and Nevada a long way from 5,000 cars a week. Although deliveries of the high end Model S and X are up, the company recently removed references to scheduling test drives from its Model 3 information page. That suggests that it will be a long time before ordinary drivers get anywhere near a Tesla electric car.

> Tesla counters that focusing on production numbers misses the point because it is more than “just” a carmaker.",4675,True,1510311701.0,2017-11-10 12:01:41,121,87,quodo1,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/7c0fx6/tesla_risks_being_overtaken_by_the_competition/,True,0.81,2017,both,search,False,False,0,

Originally Tesla was offering something different and exciting: electric cars without compromising performance, cost, or reliability.

Soon electric cars will be standard and Tesla won't be seen as a innovative electric car company, it will just be car company.

I don't think Tesla (at least the car manufacturing part of it) is going to motivate Musk long-term. I think there are things about Tesla that he might remain passionate about such pushing and popularising solar power, but I'm much less certain about Tesla's potential there.

As someone who's been following Musk since 2009 and brought TSLA stock back when it was trading below $50, I don't really see what I used to in Tesla.

comment,7dj9wn,7dj9wn,,"The Semi sounds pretty frigging amazing, not least because it's being proposed with ""500-mile range, at max (80000lb) load, at highway speeds"".

Edit: The interior looks kinda weird, but makes sense.  If the render is correct, it's a central driving position with two rear seats; there'll be dual left and right screens and no central speedometer; in addition to the rear-view mirrors the far left and far right of the screens will have the view from corresponding rear-facing cameras, but no indication if that's permanently-on.

Oh, and there's a frunk, because why not.

Edit 2: Automatic sides that adjust to any trailers to improve aero. Anti-jack-knifing through rear-wheel torque steering. Apparently, lower cost-per mile than diesel semi, though no indication of how much upfront. When convoying with other Tesla Semis, the cost halves. ""Thermonuclear explosion-proof glass""? Riiight. Though the slo-mo shot of a trailer hitch flying towards the window and bouncing off is pretty convincing. Four-wheel drive.

post,7du8rv,,Get me up to speed on investing in TSLA,"I am not super educated on the Tesla-sphere and, I'm not in the shipping industry, so some advice from ""experts"" there would be appreciated. I was doing my research, and noticing the dip in price after I saw the Semi announcement. Now, when I saw that I was stunned as I'm sure many of you were. I immediately think to myself, this will change the world entirely. [Then I saw that Walmart will be ordering 15 units for testing](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/17/wal-mart-says-its-planning-to-test-teslas-new-electric-trucks.html) and got even more interested. I knew I had wished I invested in TSLA long ago before I started investing a little bit of money, and I simply could not afford to. Now with this release, I just wonder how this could NOT be the future? With the benefits listed, I can't imagine why a company wouldn't want this truck, as it is currently today. The cost savings alone seem to ensure that this is not only the best truck you can buy.. but possibly the cheapest truck you can buy. It appears possible that this could reduce shipping costs up to 50% (truck costs).

Ferrari and Lamborghini probably have an eye on Tesla, but they aren't going throw away 60 years of heritage to chase an upstart.

I think I've thought of a solution to this. In response to this (seemingly) last resort criticism of electric cars, when range and speed problems are solved, why don't most automakers like Porsche (for the Mission E) or Tesla (for the new Roadster) do what BMW has done with the i8?

comment,7e406r,7e406r,,"A performance vehicle is a statement. A loud, visible statement that's been moulded by public perception, advertising and nearly a hundred years of power = combustion engine noise.

Slamming through gears, tinkering late at night over your riced-up Honda Civic with an eye towards driving around and impressing your friends, watching cars drift around a track - it's about admiring and mastering that power.

An electric vehicle is also becoming its own statement. It says, I do not want all that. I want zero emissions, no pollution, no smell. I want effortless speed and acceleration. Loud cars are icky. I dislike driving and only want to get from A to B. I have never touched a wrench and I never want to.

The first group of people who see other people do that, well, they'd see just piping in artificial engine noise through a speaker as the final indignity. Oh, they'd change their tune as soon as they got behind the wheel of the new Roadster, but until then it's just a sense of vague unease that covers the unformed fear that all of that is ending.

post,7eb7hg,,Congratulations to Elon for two more successful crowdfunding campaigns. Are they worth it? [Discussion topic],"The Model 3 reveal generated $450 million in interest-free micro-loans from future customers with minimal transaction costs (credit card processing fees, reveal party, Tesla store staffing) and with lenders receiving priority upon delivery of the finished product. 

The biggest difference between that phenomenal outreach and a crowfunding campaign such as those managed by Kickstarter, Indiego or [a few dozen](https://www.inc.com/magazine/201306/eric-markowitz/how-to-choose-a-crowdfunder.html) other sites? No middleman. 

The success of the Model 3 campaign has been repeated with the Powerwall and the Solar Roof.  And now, the recent Semi and Roadster2 reveal came bundled with at least two new crowdfunding campaigns ... three if you count the two Roadster2 options as being distinct.  At $5K per BAMF semi, Meijer (4), Walmart (15), and JB Hunt (several) have plunked down more than $1 million of seed money so far.  It takes only four Founder's Edition reservations of the Roadster2 for it to hit the million dollar level.  

And yet, there are still liabilities and risks from this sort of activity.    
 Is this just the new way of doing business?  Is it sustainable? Someday, a proposed product is going to fail to come to fruition ... what happens then?  Does crowdfunding carry class-action or other risks that remain to be seen?

""Elon Musk said last week that Tesla Inc. is designing a new sports car that could go from zero to 60 mph in 1.9 seconds. Not bad, but here’s a speed number that investors might want to focus on instead: 

Over the past 12 months, the electric-car maker has been burning money at a clip of about $8,000 a minute (or $480,000 an hour), Bloomberg data show. At this pace, the company is on track to exhaust its current cash pile on Monday, Aug. 6. (At 2:17 a.m. New York time, if you really want to be precise.)

To be fair, few Tesla watchers expect the cash burn to continue at quite such a breakneck pace, and the company itself says it’s ramping up output of its all-important Model 3, which will bring money in the door. Investors don’t seem concerned. Tesla shares rose almost 3 percent to $317.81 Tuesday, giving it a market capitalization of $53 billion. Ford Motor Co. is worth $48 billion.

post,7g0sns,,"Salt, cognitive dissonance and love - in reaction to the new Tesla Roadster","(Cross-posted from r/TeslaMasterRace)

He looks a cool guy, but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVOJ88id-yo) really demostrates the cognitive dissonance that many ICErs have to the electric vehicle. In some moments, he's sometimes salty about the affair and hates on Tesla. But in other moments, he's loving the new Roadster. It's a surreal mix of love and hate. I've taken some of the juiciest quotes and posted them here for your reading pleasure!

----------

""It's just the annoying things that the people that buy Teslas buy them for power and think they have the fastest car, which now they do - they have the quickest car if you do buy it. I don't know, I kind of feel like it's gonna bring this kind of nerdy side to the car community""

----------

""I think it will destroy the car community sadly""

----------

""Does a quarter mile in 8.8 seconds which is absurd and I am honestly so shocked.""

----------

""<Raves about Mercedes Project One $2.7M hyper car for half a minute> ......... and the top speed of that doesn't even compare to the new Tesla. This kills me."" (250+mph versus 217mph)

----------

""As a car person, I've always hated Tesla but I do approve of this car, but it's really taking the characteristics of a car away""

----------

""But I think there won't be really any hyper car production in the next few years because this is such a setback since the 0-60 time <of the Roadster> is almost unbeatable without illegal mods""

----------

""So I feel bad for you guys that are in hyper cars or the car enthusiasts or the car community. I feel bad because this is gonna have to show that the car community's gonna have to come together. Gas cars have to come back and beat them. We don't know.""

It would not add much weight and it would enable Tesla to protect the battery from heavy current draws. The KERS could be spun up again either by the battery or from regenerative braking. Flywheels can deliver their power very rapidly for the boost.

post,7gy8hq,,Thoughts on electric super cars,"Posted a comment in the tesla subreddit, thought it worth exploring here too.

There's a lot of hype / discussion around the Tesla roadster recently, both positive and negative.  But its a car that's not going to go into production until 2020 and we don't know anything about it other than straight-line characteristics.  

The NIO EP9 has actually lapped the nurburgring completely, and done at 6:45 (albeit with slicks).  It did it in early 2017 and its (albeit limited production) ""available to the public"".

I guess my point is, I think a lot of ink has been spilled about the Tesla Roadster, but if we're talking about purpose-built hyper / super cars, it seems to me that the company with the 3 year headstart that already lapped the nuburgring in record time and competes in motorsports seems like the better bet to pull it off, at least from a performance perspective.

I’m a Tesla enthusiast like the rest of you and I am totally pumped for the Model 3, but 10 years of owning low profile vehicles as a tall dude (6'5) have made me think twice about reserving one. Until the Y is produced, I’m going to wait it out and see what Tesla has in store for me. That said, here’s some of the things I really want from the Y.

-	Estimated EPA range of at least 300 miles (LR model) 
-	Falcon wing doors (please…) 
-	Power operated liftgate (this just makes sense for a compact SUV crossover)
-	Towing capacity

That’s all I can think of right now. I flip flop on the falcon wing doors because I’ve heard of the absolute hell they were for a while on the early Model X’s, but I hope that by now Tesla have figured out all the issues in that regard. Not sure about the range thing either, seeing as even the MX gets lower EPA range than the MS.

Let me know what you guys think!

I want the interior of the Model 3 with slightly more premium materials.

I'm on the fence about the Model Y having falcon wing doors. If they didn't have it it'd be fine but if they did i'd be excited. I think they've been making the Model X long enough now where they have the mechanism figured out to where it shouldn't have as many (if any) of the early issues the Model X falcon wing doors had. Maybe they even would have some redesign of falcon wing doors that makes them better and less likely to break/malfunction. Model Y needs some kind of thing to differentiate it from the Model 3 other than it's shape.

I want a cool design for the Model Y. A lot of crossovers i see from other manufacturers still look too big/bulky/boxy/bubble-shaped like a full size SUV does and I don't want that for the Model Y. I want the Model Y to find some middle ground where it can be slightly bigger and spacious like Crossovers should be but also still be a little sleek/sporty looking on the outside if possible.

This is an interesting point where the timing of events will be important - how soon will roads be ready for automated driving.  If the major markets are not ready for automated driving, then the EV cars (battery powered) which include automated driving will be at a competitive disadvantage (because of higher research and manufacturing costs for including automated driving).  Or will cheap EV versions take over first.  Again the Windows vs. Apple dynamic at play.

Tesla cars will have those associated higher costs:

post,7klr43,,Tesla's Semi,"Just doing some research regarding the hype for Tesla's semi, and thought I post my... thoughts here. 

With the initiatives that the Ontario government is providing for Tesla's electric semis, the price is reasonable for companies compared to other semi's on the market. With the rising cost of fuel, the savings are very attractive and should provide a good incentive for companies to buy electric semi's. 

The limitations are two items: range, and charging times. 

With electric vehicles, charging times are relatively long, and has never been an issue with gasoline vehicles. Using a supercharger, we have a charging rate of [22 miles per hour](https://www.cars.com/articles/2013/11/how-quickly-does-the-tesla-model-s-battery-charge/). Their semi has at most a range of 500 miles. That's a charging time of 22 hours and 43 minutes. I'll let someone more qualified figure out the impact to logistics, but my impressions is that even though it might be feasible, they would need to have spare semis to compensate for this charging time. This would decrease the robustness of the system, but they might still retain their gasoline fleet as backup. 

From Detroit to Sudbury, we have a driving distance of 441 miles, which is well within the operating range of said semi's. Looking at only the GTA area where the population is concentrated, this range is further decreased, rendering electric semi's to be feasible in this region.  

Overall, realistically speaking, electric semi's aren't a universal solution to transport over highways, but rather a niche solution pertaining to local deliveries. With these two points in mind, we can narrow down the market for these vehicles to a more realistic range.",2091,True,1513609699.0,2017-12-18 16:08:19,0,12,Nullrasa,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7klr43/teslas_semi/,True,0.5,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,7ku5q6,,"Looking for some advice, considering swapping out my OEM Speed3's suspension a more comfortable setup.","So I’m thinking about doing something that seems to go against the ethos of /r/cars & MazdaSpeedForum by swapping my Speed3’s suspension bits for something more comfortable & increasing its height, and would like some advice with some questions/concerns. Post regarding this topic all seem to go in the opposite direction of what I want to achieve.


My commute is now over some of the worst maintained roads I’ve come across and include big dips, abrupt rises in pavement, raised and lowered manhole covers, crossing rail tracks multiple times a day, poorly patched potholes, etc. When I lived in Miami, I was able to deal with the stiff ride. Then I moved to Washington D.C. and the roads were bad enough that I swapped my 18-inch wheels for 16-inch wheels to give myself a little more rubber between me and the road. But now living in Baltimore, the ride quality on the OEM springs & dampers can best be described as uncouth at best. While it never crashes through to the bump stops, coming out of a steep parking lot I’ll hear the bottom of my bumper scuff against the asphalt. That being said, that’s the only complaint I have about my car. I love every other aspect of it, from the turbo, LSD, practicality, fuel economy, the feeling/feedback of the: steering, brakes, manual transmission, and yes even the clutch. So instead of selling it and buying a “more comfortable” car, I’d like to see if swapping the suspension bits will allow me to better enjoy every other aspect of my car. 

With all of those complaints in mind, I’m thinking of changing my suspension bits for something with a prioritization of comfort over sportiness. This is the setup I’m considering:

**Stock Mazda 3 springs** 

Easiest/cheapest/”most comfortable” and will give me 0.5 inches more of ground clearance.

**Koni FSD Dampers**

Decently price, and I think frequency dampening will work great to keep body roll in check while dealing well with the rail tracks & expansion joints.",2966,True,1513699405.0,2017-12-19 17:03:25,7,5,AuntieMamesTravels,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7ku5q6/looking_for_some_advice_considering_swapping_out/,True,0.82,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,7l6gil,,Putting a new drive unit in a Tesla?,"I've heard that putting a new part (like a drive unit) into a Tesla is not as easy as just swapping the part, because the car checks the serial number of the part and won't run if it detects that a part has been swapped/removed.

However, I also saw a certain Tesla enthusiast (one might call him a guru) swap parts like this, and he apparently got help from someone who was able to ""re-flash"" the linux distro running on the MCU to accept the donor parts. How hard is this? Does anyone know who did that for him, and how he did it?

Edit: on further thought, if you had a car with a smashed drive unit, and a new drive unit to replace it, would it be possible to remove the board in the smashed drive unit that contains this serial number (assuming it survived) and swap it into the donor drive unit to trick the MCU into thinking nothing has changed?",852,False,1513823626.0,2017-12-21 03:33:46,0,7,jlittle988,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7l6gil/putting_a_new_drive_unit_in_a_tesla/,True,0.31,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,7lewjk,,Got rear-ended,"https://imgur.com/gallery/tpwwc

Sad sad day friends. Is the first time that I’ve ever been involved in a car accident where I was the driver. I was stopped on the highway in heavy traffic and a lady in a Porsche Cayenne slammed into me.

I’ve linked only a single picture, I think the entire rear fender needs to be replaced. It feels like the driver seat wiggles a bit, perhaps the bolts came loose for stretched. In the trunk probably needs to be realigned.

I’m so sad. This has been my dream for 10 years. I finally get the car in March of this year and right before Christmas some lady has to racket and probably take it away from me for a while.


It did it’s job. My family is safe. That’s the most important thing and one of the many reasons why I bought this car.

Can anyone tell me what I can expect? I’ve read stories that sometimes Tesla facilities don’t have parts and it can take months to get your vehicle back. Is that what I am in for?

I have the lady’s information and of course will be filing a claim against her insurance, but roughly what kind of costs are we looking at?

In case anyone is wondering how tough these cars are, she hit me probably going between 25 and 35 mph. I was at a dead stop. The only damage is what you see in that picture, and the car drove home perfectly. They are very solid.

EDIT:  Texas isn’t gonna help me much with a diminished value claim:

No court decisions specifically allowing for recovery diminution in value of a damaged vehicle in a third-party claim in addition to the cost of repair to the damaged vehicle. In action for damage to a vehicle, the owner or subrogated insurer may sue for either diminution of market value or cost of repair to the damaged vehicle. Jones v. Wallingsford, 921 S.W.2d 463 (Tex.

Make sure to take it to a shop that is Tesla certified and does a lot of Tesla repairs. If they do you’ll know because they will be knowledgeable about working with Tesla. 

Just have the shop do an estimate and then they should be able to pre order parts so you don’t have to wait as long. The only issue is if they open up the car and find more damage than they estimated - that can take longer.

You have more damage than I had - mine was fairly light - but I hope you have a smooth experience like I did.

That necessitated a new wiring harness... and Tesla took two tries to get the right one to the body shop.  So SHOULD have been faster than 2 weeks.  

Total will end up being about $2500-3000, but $0 to me thanks to nature of the crash and dash/rear cameras.  The car's out right now getting Xpel reapplied on new bumper so I don't have total for that yet.

post,7sny1a,,"Dad is Considering selling his business, can we stay on as silent shareholders?","I apologize in advance if this is the wrong place to post this question.

Long story short - 

My dad has been running a business for most of his life. It has done pretty well for our family and helped put myself and my two siblings through school, etc. It is by no means a huge company but has a lot of potential to grow under the right hands.

Someone has made him an offer to buy it. He initially said not but the offer has gone up and he is considering it. 

He is quite tired and would like to take that money and put it into other investments and semi-retire. To be honest, I think he only continued in this business so he could support us as best he could. I think he deserves to use the money to do something he enjoys.

My brother is a little against selling. He had hoped to take over the business from my father but he is young, a little reckless (I say that with love) and still has a lot to learn before he'd be ready to do anything like that. 

Question: Myself, my sister and my brother want to know if staying in the company in some capacity is realistic, i.e. as shareholders who are paid dividends.  
I mentioned this situation as a possible alternative to my brother but I don't really know how it would work. 

Any suggestions are appreciated!

""Tesla employees say the company was making batteries for its Model 3 vehicles partly by hand as recently as mid-December.
Employees also said that quality control workers were not experienced, and two said that some batteries are leaving the factory with a potentially serious defect, a claim that Tesla vigorously denies.""

""Many of the company's quality control workers are relatively inexperienced, make sloppy calculations and don't know when they're looking at flaws, according to several current and former employees. They said many quality inspectors were temp-to-hire workers with no automotive experience who Tesla hired via a staffing agency.

Tesla acknowledged the relative inexperience of some employees, but said new hires involved in battery production receive ""extensive training, including safety training.""

Two current engineers told CNBC that they are concerned some of the batteries being shipped do not have the minimum gap required between lithium ion cells. These engineers warned that this ""touching cells"" flaw could cause batteries to short out or, in worse cases, catch fire.

These engineers said they raised the issue internally, but their concerns were shrugged off by managers.""",1307,False,1516909723.0,2018-01-25 20:48:43,104,153,dvdmovie1,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/7syrms/tesla_employees_say_gigafactory_problems_worse/,True,0.86,2018,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,7tmirt,,An Idiot's Guide to Tesla's Lineup,"#Lineup

* **Roadster** 2-door roadster that's no longer sold. Replacement is coming in 2020
* **Model S** 5-meter long hatchback, competes with Mercedes CLS, Audi A7
* **Model X** 5-meter long SUV. It's the one with gullwing doors (Falcon Wing doors)
* **Model 3** Sometimes referred as M3 in Tesla forums, has no correlation with BMW M3. It is a 4.5-meter long sedan. Competes with Mercedes C-class, Audi A4.
* **Semi** (unreleased) I wont cover it in this guide, it's a semi truck.

#Models

* The **number** indicates the battery capacity. For example, Model S 60 means it has 60 Wh battery
* D after the number means it has **dual-motor**, which also means it is AWD. Example: Model X 75D
* P in front of the number means it is the **performance model** which has ""Insane mode"" acceleration available to choose from the center touchscreen. Example: Model S P85
* **Ludicrous mode** is an option on top of the P model. Contrary to popular belief, a stock P100D does NOT have ""Ludicrous Mode"". You can spot this model on the road by looking at an underline below the badge (e.g. underline below P85). People sometimes refer to this model by adding L to the end of the name. Example: Model S P100DL

Unlike self-driving features, none of the options listed above (dual motor, Ludicrous mode) are available as an upgrade later down the line. You are stuck with what you got from the factory.


Note: In the Model 3, Tesla has steered away from using battery capacity for describing the tiers. Instead, you get the ""Standard Range"" model with 50 kWh battery, and ""Long Range"" model with 75 kWh battery.

#Self Driving Hardware Features

* Models prior to September 2014 has zero self-driving capability in the sense that the steering wheel can't turn by itself at any given time.
* Models between September 2014 to October 2016 has **AP1** hardware, or Autopilot generation 1.

The 2020 start date for production was part of the information this supplier had reportedly received.

post,7vbevv,,For those wondering why people choose Model 3 over Bolt,"I'm sick of people saying the Bolt is basically the same car as the Model 3 *but available today*. No it is not, and let's not pretend it is. 

Let's start with a simple question:

# What's special about the Bolt if it had a petrol engine?

Meanwhile the Model 3, even if it was petrol, would offer:

* **Attractive, luxurious-looking design.** Design is something subjective, but we can at least agree that it looks like a Model S, a car costing twice as much, combined with a nose that looks like a Porsche Panamera, also a car double the price. The Bolt looks like a bloated version of a Chevy Spark, a 10k car, literally the cheapest GM offering today.
* **Unique interior design.** I'm not going to say it's better or worse than the competitors, because its a matter of personal preference as well, but I'm going to say its a minimalism design that we have never seen before.
* **Rear window that goes further than other cars**. Same here, you may not like it, but you can't argue that it's something new.
* **Alcantara, wood panel in the interior.** This signifies a more luxurious interior. I haven't been in either cars, but I wouldn't be surprised the plastic material is better on the 3 than the Bolt
* **Significantly smoother, larger touchscreen.** I would argue it is better than Mercedes S-class, Audi A8, even Model S and X, or actually, *literally any car*. The Bolt has something similar to other economy GM vehicles
* **Autopilot**. Hardware that is ready for full self driving
* **0-60 time in 5 seconds**
* **RWD (or AWD)**, as opposed to FWD
* **Multi-link rear suspension** (fully independent) vs. torsion beam on the Bolt (same kind of suspension as Ford Fiesta, less advanced than Ford Focus)
* And with it, comes **sporty handling characteristics**, as the reviewers mentioned.",2130,True,1517795806.0,2018-02-05 02:56:46,0,60,ptrkhh,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7vbevv/for_those_wondering_why_people_choose_model_3/,True,0.18,2018,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,7won9d,,[Discussion] I attended The Boring Company's Culver City Presentation. I'm concerned about its ability to win public trust.,"I attended the Boring Company's January 22 presentation to the City Council of the City of Culver City (this is legitimately how they refer to themselves), where they pitched their plan to burrow underneath the town as part of their “Phase 1” 6.5 mile tunnel. I went with the intention to simply gather information for my podcast, and left with the sinking feeling that the company is biting off more than it can chew.

The Boring Company presenters themselves were competent, capable, and as well-prepared as I imagine they could have been, considering the circumstances. (I'll get to that in a bit.) My two main takeaways from that City Council meeting were:

**1.)** There's a vast difference between selling private goods and winning public trust

**2.)** Any company will struggle to succeed when their CEO (by his own admission) dedicates ""2 or 3 percent"" of his time to it.

Let's backup, and discuss how the Council meeting went before The Boring Company gave their presentation and fielded questions. It shines a light on how much of public work is a slow grind of competing interests, and a stark contrast to the ""move fast and break things"" mentality of many technology companies.

A Boy Scout was invited to the front of the room to lead all of us in the Pledge of Allegiance. And after Vice Mayor Thomas Small discussed the upcoming ""Kindness Week"" at Culver City Middle School, eight residents were each given two minutes to speak on their chosen topic. (I'm not sure how these eight were chosen specifically.) A selection:

One man complained about Film LA’s (the organization that oversees film permits in the Los Angeles area) abuse of Culver City parking. He was quite emotional and infuriated.

Another speaker - a poet - read a couple poems she had written, one comparing Congresspeople to Baboons.

Yet another discussed permitting requests for proposed cannabis retail stores.

If you are going to present before any elected body (city council, county commission, school board, etc.), you must be prepared for a public meeting with detractors. You must anticipate the obvious objections ahead of time and be fully prepared to address them. There will always be objections.  And it is for this reason that most companies hire people with experience on SLED (state, local, education) accounts who know how handle it. 

It is also a very good point that it is difficult to gain public trust if you are undermined by your CEO’s antics, but that can be overcome with the right team presenting (and the CEO is going to have to live with his team on the ground agreeing that he behavior is “eccentric” publicly).

post,80d897,,UPS Dip,"I'm considering buying the dip, do your DD and tell me what you think. Here are my thoughts:

A correction was definitely expected after amazon announced their plans for last-mile delivery. But, from what I found, Amazon deliveries make up between 5-10 percent of UPS revenues. Therefore, the 25 percent drop in UPS since mid January seems a bit harsh.

With e-commerce on the rise, there will continue be a growing demand for logistic companies. 

Also, UPS has been making great strides towards electrifying their fleet. They just announced they will be partnering with Workhorse Group, and sampling 50 electric vans. Tesla has also announced that they will be partnering with UPS to provide them with electric semi trucks. With electric vehicles becoming the cheaper alternative to gas and diesel, these  partnerships could be the beginning of something great, and really improve UPS's bottom line. 

I'm curious to see how Amazon goes about obtaining an electric fleet. Workhorse is a small company, and will have their hands full with the UPS partnership. I cannot imagine Elon partnering with Bezos, but that's just a gut feeling, and would love to hear everyone's thoughts on that. 

Will UPS continue to dip? Or is it ready to pop? Let me know what you guys think. 

Edit: I have positions in workhorse group and Tesla. I also decided to buy UPS earlier today.

Workhorse group is still a very young company, but it looks like they are making a lot of the right plays. There doesn't seem to be much competition in the small electric truck field,for now, so their head start could help them compete against the big contenders when they decide to make the switch to electric trucks. 

Workhorse is also working on a drone delivery product with UPS, to help drivers cut off some miles wherever possible. 

It is definitely a risky play but do your dd and let me know what you think. ",641,False,1519671380.0,2018-02-26 19:56:20,2,0,DoU92,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/80d897/ups_dip/duv4tsu/,True,,2018,tesla,search,False,False,0,duv4tsu
comment,80d897,80d897,,"Purely Anecdotal from my father being a 40 year UPS employee, a union steward, and me having worked for them during college:


UPS supports their drivers way more than FedEX and the Teamsters have a lot of power at UPS. FedEX Ground used to make their drivers buy routes and trucks, I'm not sure they make them buy trucks anymore. FedEX express is company owned and the drivers don't really have to buy anything. FedEX is much more fractured in my opinion, whereas UPS operates as a well-integrated company. In order to become a driver at UPS, you have to gain seniority. In order to get the good routes, you have to gain seniority. If you switch from package to feeder (semi) then you lose your seniority for route bidding purposes. This leads to how UPS and the Teamsters interact.


The teamsters have long exercised a level of control over UPS, think the 1997 strike. Wages, benefits, and just about anything else is set every few years during Collective Bargaining. This allows the company to project these costs for several years. But, it also means that sometimes management has to do some weird things like find work to fill time. For example, as a part time employee, I was guaranteed 3.5 hours of pay every day, no matter if there was enough work for me or not. I wasn't even a union member. 

While it is accurate to say private sector (and soon to be public) unions don't have much power in 2018, it varies greatly depending on the company.

post,80tyfa,,How can I make at least 50 dollars daily consistently?,"Okay before I get the angry, hateful comments let me tell you guys a quick story of where I am at in my life.

I am 24 years old, I have an electrical engineering degree, and my biggest passion in the world is playing soccer/futbol. My biggest dream is to play at least at the semi pro level. I won't get into it too much but I have struggled with injuries most of my life and due to those injuries, I decided to focus on my engineering career rather than on my futbol career. But recently I came to realize that we are all going to die one day... and I don't want to die with a lot of ""what ifs"" on my mind. So I found a great personal trainer that is helping me reach my athletic goals. I train with him twice a day for about 6 hours in total.

Anyways, I can go on and on about my athletic goals but I'm here to seek financial advice. I was working around 60 hours a week at my old job(Controls Engineering). I was able to save up a bit but I'll eventually run out if I don't start getting some income soon lol.

What do you guys suggest I should focus on? What has worked for you guys? I've been doing some research on dropshipping items from amazon and walmart on ebay but I'm open to suggestions before I pull any trigger.

I just want to make enough money to survive right now. I pay 500 a month for rent, 100 for my training sessions and about 300 on other bills(phone, gas , groceries). 50 dollars daily should be sufficient to survive.

What I've tried so far: -Dropshipping items from aliexpress through shopify and facebook ads -- Results: Sold one 9.99 item after spending 3 weeks and 40 dollars of facebook ads. Also, didn't like the fact that my customer had to wait 2-4 weeks to get their item.

-Private Label with Amazon FBA --Results: Currently doing this right now. So far I'm 4 months into this process and I've lost 4k so far :/

Catalysts


* New GeForce series using the new Volta architecture, Series 20. Announcement will be big, should be in March 2018. The already released GPUs with Volta have been successful, I expect that trend to continue.


* Cryptocurrency becoming more popular. Crypto isn't going away, so I'd assume it to be a catalyst. I don't like to pay attention to it. 


* Two years until we are seeing some of Nvidia's big autonmous vehicles come to life.

If we see some success in the execution of these projects, I'd consider it a catalyst. I'm confident their execution will be successful given the success they've already demonstrated in AI with their datacenter revenue.


* Gaming industry big news (PC). Every year there is more gamers, every year gamers get better jobs, every year there are more games. GPUs are an integral part to gaming, so these revenues will grow with the gaming market.


Risks:


* Semiconductor industry decline. The semiconductor industry is interesting because a decline in one can cause they others to underperform. This is an entire topic on its own.

""People who have worked at Tesla say Mr. Musk’s ambition and vision are inspiring. But the hard-charging culture can be exhausting, they say.

Brett Foster, a former Tesla engineer who redesigned faulty retractable door handles on the Model S, recalls a profanity-laced email in mid-2013 in which Mr. Musk prodded managers to soften their communications with lower-level employees. “ ‘Don’t be an a—’ was the gist of it,” Mr. Foster says. “I actually kind of liked that he did it.”

Some managers tried to emulate Mr. Musk’s never-say-no style, but “without being as smart as Elon,” says Mr. Foster, who didn’t interact with the CEO regularly. “I struggled with the culture and am extremely happy I am no longer there.” He now works at Samsung Electronics Co.""

post,84hqui,,"Switch ($SWCH) is a data center stock positioned to be a growth stock, why is no one talking about this?","**I want to preface this by saying I am not trying to sandbag, I am trying to open discussion so maybe someone can see through my faults** 


**SWCH is a data center, colocation business that has more growth potential than its peers. This is because it is a data center company which is not structured as a REIT. REITS have to pay 90% of their earnings as dividends to remain classified as a REIT and reap those tax benefits. The large data center companies like EQIX and DLR are REITS because of the large amounts of properties they own. SWCH chose to be structured a different way, as a UPC, so they can reinvest their earnings back into their company.**


Switch has their main data center facility in Las Vegas, Nevada, and this facility has an interesting story. In 2002, the CEO Rob Roy attended an Enron auction for this facility. The facility was built with millions of dollars, and Roy bought it for $930K. This was a clear and very strategic move by Roy, and these strategic moves have continued through the life of his company. I like this because it shows the CEO is very strategic, and his decisions have been smart and executed so far.


Comparison's of their locations to two large other colocations businesses, Equinix (EQIX) and Digital Trust Realty (DLR):


* SWCH has a fully operational campus called Core in Las Vegas. This is their primary revenue campus with a utilization rate of 94%, gross square footage of 2M, and power capacity at 275MW with construction of another facility bringing it up to 315MW. Their other campuses are a bit unnerving. They have a campus in Tahoe Reno with one operational building with a total of eight buildings planned. Their operational building in Tahoe is 1.4M square feet with up to 130MW of power capacity. These campuses in Nevada are connected through their proprietary superloop which connects lucrative California markets to these data centers.",6343,True,1521067854.0,2018-03-14 23:50:54,68,42,Noqt,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/84hqui/switch_swch_is_a_data_center_stock_positioned_to/,True,0.87,2018,tesla,search,False,False,0,

>Moody's downgrades Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) corporate family rating to B3, senior notes to Caa1. Outlook is negative.

>Moody\'s Investors Servicedowngraded Tesla, Inc.'s (Tesla) Corporate Family Rating (CFR) to B3 from B2, unsecured note rating to Caa1 from B3, and Speculative Grade Liquidity rating to SGL-4 from SGL-3. The outlook is negative.

>RATINGS RATIONALE

>Tesla's ratings reflect the significant shortfall in the production rate of the company's Model 3 electric vehicle. The company also faces liquidity pressures due to its large negative free cash flow and the pending maturities of convertible bonds ($230 million in November 2018 and $920 million in March 2019). Tesla produced only 2,425 Model 3s during the fourth quarter of 2017; it is currently targeting a weekly production rate of 2,500 by the end of March, and 5,000 per week by the end of June. This compares with the company's year-earlier production expectations of 5,000 per week by the end of 2017 and 10,000 by the end of 2018.

>The Caa1 rating of the unsecured notes reflects the junior position of the notes relative to the company's $1.9 billion secured credit facility.

>Tesla continues to benefit from solid market acceptance of Models S and X, which collectively hold over a third of the US luxury market. In addition, third-party evaluations of the Model 3 remain favorable, consumer response to the vehicle is sound, and advance purchase reservations and deposits remain high.

We are still in beta. We arnt even discussing fsd. The enhanced autopilot option (which is what’s currently on the streets) is no where near a full release. Until recently, the car wasn’t even using all of its cameras. Enhanced autopilot once complete will allow for use of 4/8 of the cameras on board while fsd will use 8/8. Until this newest update we were at 1/8. Not sure where exactly we stand right now as there’s been some back and forth. 

The point is autopilot is currently a driver convenience feature not a self driving feature. You need to have your eyes on the road at all times.

post,8a8ts4,,More specific valuation question,"In a previous post I confessed I struggled with the idea of valuation. Particularly, I struggle with understanding how the price of a stock is tied to the value of the company. I got some great feedback. 

I've been told that when I buy a stock, I buy a percentage of the company, including its debts and revenues. But more than that, I buy a share of its expected earnings. Moreover, I was reminded that Graham famously wrote that in the short term the market acts like a voting machine, while in the long term it acts like a weight machine. Basically, that while a stock like Tesla may be overpriced in the short term, the stock price will eventually meet with the company's true valuation in the long term. So I set out to test that theory. 

I backtested the stock for Ford Motor Company. Using this site: https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio . If I invested $10,000 in Ford Motor Company in January of 1986, I would have $99,137 by March 31, 2018. Adjusted for inflation, it'd be more like $43,518. 

This suggests that Ford Motor Company is worth over 4X what it was worth back in 1986. However, as I understand it, the American auto industry has been in decline and is a shell of the monolith it used to be. I can't understand how a company that is weaker today than in 1986 is valued at 4X what it was back in its hey day. Hey day might be a bit of a stretch, but I think it's safe to say that the American Auto industry was doing much better in the 80s than today. 

Can someone please help me understand? ",1533,False,1523015103.0,2018-04-06 13:45:03,2,10,HoyaSaxons,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/8a8ts4/more_specific_valuation_question/,True,0.75,2018,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,8as5ek,,Tesla and Apple,"Hi all,

I know, I know, one more post about Tesla, but I'm currently trying to build a model to see at what valuation it would be interesting to buy, but I'm starting to think I'm wasting my time. Tesla is almost tripling their net losses yoy while not even doubling their revenue. Even with the recent drop, Enterprise Value is 60 billion.
Then I'm thinking WTF? OK, they may be the next Apple, but even then, that's hell of a lot of risk for the possible reward. They are crippled with debt.

Now I remembered, at some point Apple almost went bankrupt. And we can draw many similarities between Apple and Tesla. Are there any similarities regarding the financials? Was Apple that bad financially back in the day? I'm thinking I'd be willing to take a risk on tesla if the EV was around 20 billion, but that would imply a stock price of ... less than $70 with current debt levels.

Seriously, even with amazing futuristic prospects, solar roofs, vertical integration, etc. and I'm personally super hyped about the company and their products, I just don't see how this makes sense?

I would guess that the stock was incredibly cheap in this period, in stark contrast to TSLA now. It's hard to remember, but the closest apple had ever come to the iPhone back in the mid 90s was the Newton- a failure.

If Tesla were to go ch 11, the infrastructure will most likely get switched off. I'm not saying that I likely see Tesla heading towards chapter 11, but I do think the chances are certainly greater than 0 and what isn't talked about in those discussions is what will happen to the infrastructure.

post,8en3im,,"The BFR: too big, too soon?","Or not?

The most important and most remarkable development in the human breakout into Space is SpaceX. What SpaceX and Musk are doing is what the general space community had been longing for, and tried to develop in fits and starts for many years. But I have to observe the whole BFR issue from the standpoint of having worked in and watched the unfolding history of space transportation development. BFR looks like a “bridge too far” after the very savvy and practical approaches of the Falcon series to date.

BFR is “too big,” and “too soon,” because there’s no market emerging in the near future for it. Also, the underlying premise behind BFR is to accelerate Musk’s dream of colonizing Mars. This is a mistake. Evidence and documentation is emerging that implies humans, in their present evolution, are not likely to thrive as permanent residents off of Earth. Long-term visitors, yes, but a lifetime, or even being born “out there?” Not likely. I can elaborate on that at another time, but suffice it to say that Mars is not a sober goal for having 1 million humans by 2100. And building a civilization on Mars with chemical rocket transportation, even if that is just meant for a first phase, is highly questionable. But that is what drives Musk, and why he, ultimately founded SpaceX.

Meanwhile though, he’s developing what’s turning into the most successful space transportation system ever. That comes first. And Musk knows that if BFR is to succeed, it must first fulfill actual needs much closer to home. Hence such schemes as the “point-to-point” ballistic transportation idea. That was something first advanced by Robert Heinlein. But generally, one starts “small” with such ideas. BFR is not small.

post,8g8uk6,,"Elon, The third Industrial revolution, and cryptocurrency","For each industrial revolution, there were advancements in communication, energy, and transportation 

1st=Print, coal, steam engine

2nd=Telephone, fossil fuels, cars

Future revolution=Internet, cheap renewables, and self-driving vehicles

The future supply chain will be powered cheaply by advanced solar and wind energy, run by AI machines all connected and controlled through the internet. This will make almost all business more efficient thus allowing an economic boom.

Elon will be involved in all these areas with Starlink, solar city, Tesla, and SpaceX.

In addition to supply chain improvement there will also be big improvements for consumers:

Housing bills- (Solar City) install a solar roof to supply your energy or buy energy from your neighbor with excess energy from his solar roof. Blockchain technology (power ledger) allows the peer to peer sale of solar energy thus eliminating the middleman, saving the consumer money and reducing effects on the environment. All house appliances and heating could be run on this energy. In addition to power and heat, your internet/phone/TV may also be supplied by Starlink depending on its success/cost. (optimistic)

Transportation- (Tesla)You could either own an electric car and charge it via the energy mentioned above or use driverless taxi service. For long distance use BFR earth to earth to fly across the globe in less than an hour. Or to Mars!!

All of these systems can be implemented anywhere in the world. In this future, a portion of the global spending on bills and travel could be paid indirectly to one company/ companies owned by Elon. Why not make your own global currency to allow ease of entry to all citizens of the world and reduce fees? Enter cryptocurrency.

A SpaceX ICO is an interesting idea to me. In fact I just spent an hour reading up on ICOs all so I could offer an opinion on this.

I don't think an ICO would make sense for Tesla. I feel like an ICO would send the wrong message to investors in their normal stock. Imagine the headlines: ""Desperate Musk turns to ICO to save drowning Tesla from imminent death.""

An ICO might make more sense for SpaceX simply because it's a private company. But again I have my doubts here for a couple reasons.

- SpaceX has no problem raising capital from traditional investors like Fidelity and Google.
- Maybe an ICO would create tension between existing investors and ICO investors? I don't really know enough about this topic to say for sure, but it seems like something to watch for.

> Advertising and Promotion Costs

> Advertising and sales promotion costs are expensed as incurred. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, advertising, promotion and related marketing expenses were $9.0 million, $3.9 million and $2.9 million, respectively

> Marketing

> Historically, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our vehicles, and we believe we will continue to do so. To date, media coverage and word of mouth have been the primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. We also use traditional means of advertising including product placement in a variety of media outlets and pay-per-click advertisements on websites and applications relevant to our target demographics.

I'm not sure if the big shows they put on around the launches of their vehicles goes under the costs I cited above

When I said that they have a big marketing budget, I meant all activities related to sales. That showroom in Santa Monica isn't cheap, and it's arguably there mostly for marketing purposes.

post,8j63s5,,"When people Who have No actual Experience Write Crazy: ""Apple Buys Tesla? Amazon Buys Sears? 3 Dream Mergers That Just Make Sense""","https://www.thestreet.com/opinion/apple-should-buy-tesla-and-amazon-should-buy-sears-dream-deals-14586350

Even a cursory examination of these ideas show no business or tech common sense at all!  I guess given the author doesn't have an MBA or any actual business experience, I should cut her some slack but she's built up as supposedly knowing something.  Honestly not so much.

Apple Buys Tesla:

The first problem is core competency and how Apple has historically been loath to enter areas where it well knows it has none.  

First there was the iPhone and staying at arm's length with all carriers either in terms of investment or buy-out - Apple knows the telecom business model is something it knows **nothing** about and would never be good at.  

Second is Business computing - why doesn't Apple continually avoid that market?  Because their business model involves selling and support direct to end users but in business IT is the buyer and the end-user gets no say is what computer is put in front of them; this break Apple's business model and company strengths so they beg off.  

Third is televisions and Apple TV - why did Steve Jobs say he'd ""figured it out but couldn't actually crack the nut of TV?"" - because TV HW is low margin which doesn't fit the Apple business model and cable companies present the same problem as telecom carriers - low margin, diffuse markets, race-to-the-bottom with the wrong business model.  So why not Tesla?  

These are the same problems as a Tesla acquisition would entail - the business model of mass production of cars has neither the margins nor the business model fit to what Apple does well.

Amazon Buys Sears:

Ah no.  A cursory investigation of the recent history of Sears shows it has become a poison apple - the guy who owns Sears has sold of its most valuable assets, the real estate and key brands out, and merely leases the same back to Sears.  That includes all stores and  key brands like Die Hard and Craftsman Tools.",6356,True,1526238378.0,2018-05-13 21:06:18,0,0,mantrap2,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/8j63s5/when_people_who_have_no_actual_experience_write/,True,0.5,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

100% agreed. If I can't literally respond to e-mails while I drive down the road, what's the point? Either I want to drive, and it takes up all my attention, or I don't want to babysit it *at all*. Why even offer the feature if I have to hang out with it like it's a toddler with access to the silverware drawer? 

I understand that the tech is developing, but right now it seems to have very limited uses, and every few weeks it seems there's another crash and another explanation from Tesla that the driver was using the system incorrectly.

post,8srw0z,,Questions about the Chevy Volt history,"I have a father-in-law that is an EV-skeptic (or at least is someone who prefers the status quo). Whenever he wants to talk about EVs he only brings up the negative headlines like Tesla AP crashes and single-day TSLA stock price drops.

But most of all he likes to harp on the Chevy Volt. He enjoys touting a claim that the government bought 10,000 Volts to boost sales numbers. He also said that a lot of the Volt batteries caught fire. Is there any truth to these claims?

A quick Google search shows there was a lot of controversy surrouding the Volt when it arrived in 2011. A lot of talk about government subsidies, etc. But my question is, is the Volt really deserving of all this controversy? Or is all that old news and is the Volt now able to stand on its own two feet, so to speak? Is my FIL just using old headlines about the Volt to convince himself EVs are bad?

\*\*EDIT\*\*

Thank you everyone for all the information! I'm glad to know that the voice of reason at the back of my head telling me that the ""government buying 10,000 Volts"" doesn't sound accurate, was correct.

Unfortunately, I don't own an electric vehicle and none my close family or friends have one either, so I don't have one in the driveway for him to try out.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk elicited quite a bit of [skepticism](https://bgr.com/2018/06/25/lamborghini-vs-tesla-roadster-battery-speed-terzo-millennio/) when he [boasted](https://electrek.co/2017/06/13/tesla-roadster-next-gen-elon-musk-maximum-plaid/)  in June 2017 that the electric automaker’s next-generation Roadster  would be able to accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in under two  seconds — a feat that [Musk said](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/11/17/tesla-unveils-electric-big-rig-truck-amid-manufacturing/) would make the vehicle the “fastest production car ever.”

Now, a Tesla test driver is saying Musk’s boast might have even been “conservative.”

“I think I can say  without getting in trouble that those are actual figures,” says Emile  Bouret, who says he's test-driven the new Roadster. 

""Those aren’t theoretical. Those aren’t calculations. We’ve done those numbers,"" Bouret says in a [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=242&v=UcI-5AzPlr8)  posted to the VINwiki YouTube page on Tuesday. ""And I probably  shouldn’t say that those numbers are even conservative, but they are.

 “That thing is going to be a proper weapon.""

The new sports car is not expected to be available until 2020, but experts have already voiced [reservations](https://jalopnik.com/how-the-tesla-roadster-might-pull-off-zero-to-60-mph-in-1820682224) about the new Roadster's so-called “Maximum Plaid” speed mode.

It’s been another rough quarter for the rollout of [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US)’s Model 3. The factory was shut down at least twice for [extensive upgrades](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-06-08/tesla-model-3-photos-of-elon-musk-s-factory-in-fremont), a new production line was hastily erected in a [tent in the parking lot](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-25/the-future-of-tesla-hinges-on-this-gigantic-tent), and Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk moved from sleeping on the couch to [sleeping under the desk](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-races-to-exit-teslas-production-hell-1530149814). He was [even seen personally torquing bolts](https://twitter.com/S_Padival/status/1009956753272782848) on an assembly line, alongside a summer intern. 

Now the mad scramble to meet a self-imposed production deadline—a rate of 5,000 cars per week by the end of June—is coming to an end. The quarter concludes Saturday, and Tesla is expected to report its production figures for the last three months before the July 4 holiday. Tesla has repeatedly fallen short of its own manufacturing targets. Now investors will find out exactly how many cars Tesla made, sold, and stockpiled and what sort of weekly rate they were finally able to achieve.

Here’s our rundown of what to expect. 

## Seeing a Shortfall: Bloomberg’s Model 3 Tracker

Back in February, Bloomberg introduced an experimental tool to [track the Model 3 rollout](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/). The tracker uses vehicle identification numbers (VINs) to estimate production in real time.

comment,8uu222,8uu222,,">One thing that makes this quarter particularly hard to assess is the approaching expiration of the U.S. tax credit for electric vehicles. Tesla may be suppressing U.S. sales as the quarter ends as way to extend its federal electric-vehicle tax credit of $7,500 per car. The subsidy begins to phase out one full quarter after the quarter in which Tesla sells its 200,000th electric car in the U.S. By hitting that milestone after July 1, rather than a day earlier, Tesla would gain an additional three months of tax credits that could be worth more than $400 million to Tesla customers, according to Bloomberg estimates.

post,8vu4mx,,Historical context on the tax credit phase out - Toyota Prius,"Most folks waiting for their Model 3s believe (or at least hope) Tesla delayed selling the 200,000th car to July to extend the full $7,500 tax credit to December 31, 2018.  I feel that's likely, though others disagree.  There's some confusion (a least to me) when and how we'll find out what the deal is.  

I've read nothing is official until we see the *official* IRS form, which should be something like [form 30D.  New Qualified Plug-in Electric Drive Motor Vehicles - Tesla, Inc.] (https://www.irs.gov/businesses/30d-new-qualified-plug-in-electric-drive-motor-vehicles-tesla-inc), whcih I don't believe will be updated until 2019.  Hopefully, we'll get word from Tesla or even the IRS sooner than that.  


I thought a good guide might be to look at what happened with Toyota in 2006 when they each hit the hybrid limit and began the similar tax credit phase out.


According to this [Sept 29, 2006 IRS Press Release](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/additional-toyota-and-lexus-vehicles-certified-for-the-energy-tax-credit), Toyota reported hitting it in 2006 Q2.  So this release came out about 3 months later.  It appears word got out before then, as evidenced by this [August 12, 2006 Tax Blog](http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2006/08/toyota_prius_is.html), but I haven't found an earlier source.  So that's 1.5 months after the quarter ended.  I didn't have any luck finding references from earlier.

Incidentally, I found an [Inside EV article discussing the Prius History in relation to Tesla](https://insideevs.com/toyota-prius-history-paints-picture-tesla-future/), but not tax credit specific.

post,8vxnz0,,PSA for US buyers: arbitration clause,"I just bought the model 3 (I get it this week!) and saw there's a binding arbitration agreement in the ""Motor Vehicle Purchase Agreement."" I just wanted to make sure everyone was aware of this and that you can opt out. You must opt out within 30 days of ""signing"" the Purchase Agreement.

First, to opt out, write a letter to:

    Tesla, Inc.  
    PO Box 15430  
    Fremont, CA 94539-7970

Your letter needs to include:

* Your name
* Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
* Intent to opt out of the arbitration provision

If you paid your $2500 deposit on 6/27 when the remaining reservations opened, you should notify Tesla by 7/27 to be safe, so mail your letter by 7/23.

## What's this about?

Normally if a company harms you, you have several avenues to resolve the issue: negotiation, non-binding arbitration, individual law suits, class-action (group) law suits, and more. You can also appeal the courts decision if necessary. However, mandatory binding arbitration limits your options to just individual arbitration, so it's much more difficult to get resolution and much more likely that they would win. You can't appeal a binding arbitration decision.

This agreement forces arbitration for any issue with Tesla, including privacy, safety, warranty, and lease problems.

Binding arbitration is not consumer friendly. Here are a few articles about it.

post,8xlozj,,How Silicon Valley stops Innovation,"Silicon Valley promotes their amazing ability to build innovative products and services that change the world. The reality is that this is for the most part a lie.

The most “innovative” companies have actually done very simple things that for the most part aren’t very special. This isn’t usually fault of the founders, rather, the ignorant “investment” community whose real purpose is to hold back amazing people.

Uber should’ve released self-driving cars in 2012. Google Fiber should’ve been in the USA everywhere by 2010 and global by 2011. Apple’s products are absolutely trash considering the amount of bugs they have, yet they have “all the money in the world” for development. This isn’t the fault of Travis Kalanick (he’s a fucking smart person, and people that call him arrogant are jealous) or every team member at Fiber. It’s more the lack of imagination and creativity (along with jealousy) that many “wealthy” individuals have regarding the future.

I’ve found that in Silicon Valley, you will develop an up and coming world-changing technology (or have a full idea and plan for it), and jealous investors will take control of the company and screw it over (this is just one example). There is so much fraud with products (MagicQueef being one of them) and the announcements made in general. Snapchat is a joke that I will not even bother discussing.

God forbid an actual self-made teen (as I was) comes along and tries to make a name for himself. Almost INSTANTLY I was ousted by frauds such as Vinod Khosla (who is an ignorant, broke, and sad person) whose life depends on his false billionaire title.

Tesla cars are made in China, their mileage is about 1/3 of what is advertised (sorry unless you drive like an ignorant Tesla driver), and you’re not saving the world by driving the car. I’ve lived in China and there’s nothing wrong with having cars made in China, but you can’t make it such a selling point (I know that “made in USA” is not the main reason people buy Teslas).",2718,True,1531198469.0,2018-07-10 06:54:29,1,2,advncdfinesse,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/8xlozj/how_silicon_valley_stops_innovation/,True,0.54,2018,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,8xqgcg,,Cars We Might See On US Roads 2019-2021,"**This post was one of my posts from** r/Future_Cars**.**

We know what's coming for 2018, but we don't know what is coming later, yet. But I have searched far and wide on the web to figure out which cars may be coming to the US in the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.

* **Alfa Romeo Alfetta**

The Alfa Romeo Alfetta was a fastback coupe and sedan sold 1972 to 1987 but was sold as the Sports Sedan in the US. AR wants to bring it back as a mid-size or full-size luxury sedan that would fight MB, Lincoln, Audi, BMW, Cadillac, and Jaguar sedans. If it does come out it will revive the Alfetta nameplate, but won't be as similar to the model.

* **BMW i4**

Nobody knows what the upcoming BMW i4 EV could be. Some say hatchback, some say sedan, and some say wagon. I am pretty sure it would be 4-Series-based sedan that would have a wagon variant. I can be wrong, but, you know. It isn't coming until somewhere in between '19 and '21.

* **Chrysler Atlantica/Aspen**

The Chrysler Aspen was the slow-selling version of the Dodge Durango. I don't know why, but it was. Just like the Pacifica crossover. It is rumored that there will be a new Aspen, possibly called Atlantica, that would go up against the Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia, Buick Enclave, Mazda CX-9, and the upcoming Hyundai Palisade. Just imagine a Chrysler SUV with pieces of those others mixed in.

* **Honda Passport:**

The Honda Passport wasn't much other than just a rebadged Isuzu Rodeo sold from year 1993 to 2002. It didn't sell that well. But Honda is cooking up a new Passport that might sell better. It is rumored to be a coupe-like crossover based on the Honda Avancier/UR-V sold in China.

* **Jeep Wagoneer/Grand Wagoneer**

The Jeep Wagoneer was such a great seller at the time that it lasted in the same looks for a few decades, but it just got old and sales started to slow down. So, Jeep wants to make a new one (possibly succeeding the ageing Grand Cherokee) which might be based on the China-only Grand Commander.",3946,True,1531237998.0,2018-07-10 17:53:18,0,13,WaddlesJP13,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8xqgcg/cars_we_might_see_on_us_roads_20192021/,True,0.49,2018,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,8zef4k,,Longtime muscle car guy and r/cars reader's thoughts on a weekend with a Tesla Model 3,"As a lifelong car guy, one of my foundational rules is that if someone offers me time behind the wheel of something I've never driven before, be it an econobox or an exotic, I take it. I may lend up liking it, I may not, but at least I can say I've driven it. It was with this mindset that I said ""yes"" when a friend offered to let me babysit his Tesla Model 3 while he was away for a weekend.  As I find many of the critics on here seem to have never actually driven a Model 3 for an extended period, I thought I'd offer my longtime car guy thoughts.  I'm also not looking to debate aspects of Tesla's cult, or Elon Musk as a person; this is about a car.

The car in question was a Rear Wheel Drive Model 3, with the (currently mandatory) premium upgrade package, upgraded battery, and Autopilot.  First thing I noticed is that the Model 3, while not as pretty as the Model S, does look better in person than in photos, although that's not saying much.  I poked the awkward fulcrum-based, different-for-the-sake-of-being-different door handle and got in.  Seats were comfy, although the floor seemed higher than a normal car due to the batteries underneath, which made it tough to find a comfortable seating position.

I'll save the missives about no-dashboard-screen-only argument and just say that during the day, I got used to having to look over to get my speed without much issue.  Climate controls were anchored to the bottom of the main screen such that I could safely adjust the temperature while driving, while other simple things were reserved for redlights.  And while the blank slat in front of me was less offensive than expected during the day, the one thing I didn't get used to, at all, was having just a void of darkness in front of me during nighttime driving.  Ironically, in a car that requires you to go into a touchscreen menu to open the glove box, that void in front of my eyes at night ended up being the one thing I couldn't get over.",4692,True,1531772308.0,2018-07-16 22:18:28,729,437,ViperRT10Matt,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8zef4k/longtime_muscle_car_guy_and_rcars_readers/,True,0.91,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

A second screen or HUD would go a long way. Most cars have nice two screen setups by now (including the Model S). 

Big points off for steering feel. The steering was the most electronic feeling mill I’ve ever turned. All the entry level Germans are far better in what is communicated back to the driver. 

The trunk feels and sounds flimsy to close. The frunk even moreso; I was worried I was going to bend or dent it when trying to shut it. 

The glass roof is a novelty that does nothing to make the car feel more premium to me, but I get why others like it.

I will say that the audio quality of the stereo is up there with the best Ive heard, but that being said, the music interface was confusing, and the built in streaming radio often failed to load despite having four bars of cell signal. 

For many people, the drivetrain and green aspect will make up for all that. And my perceptions of what a sedan interior should be are colored by years of being shown very nice European interiors.

**Deliveries**

As usual, Tesla’s vehicle deliveries drive most of its earning results since vehicle sales represent the automaker’s main revenue stream at the moment.

[Tesla already confirmed its second quarter 2018 deliveries: 40,740 vehicles](https://electrek.co/2018/07/02/tesla-official-model-3-production-numbers-q2/) – a new record for the company thanks to the Model 3 production ramp starting to produce decent numbers.

The delivery breakdown for the quarter was:

* 18,440 Model 3’s
* 10,930 Model S vehicles
* 11,370 Model X SUVs.

Those numbers are adjusted slightly during the release of the earnings.

Additionally, Tesla has a high number of vehicles currently in transit: 11,166 Model 3 vehicles and 3,892 Model S and X vehicles were heading to customers at the end of Q2.

Here are Tesla quarterly global deliveries of all current vehicles in production since their launches:

**Revenue**

Wall Street’s revenue consensus is $3.791 billion for the quarter and [Estimize](https://www.estimize.com/tsla?show_confirm=true#chart=historical), the financial estimate crowdsourcing website, predicts almost $100 million more: $3.886 billion in revenue.",4888,True,1533147364.0,2018-08-01 20:16:04,300,1323,FredTesla,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/93rhl3/tesla_tsla_second_quarter_2018_results_and/,True,0.96,2018,both,search,False,False,0,
post,93rji3,,Clarification on business vs entrepreneur,"This seems obvious. It also seems arrogant to some. But it is just a genuine (possibly rhetorical) question, to make a point on a view I have and hopefully debate and learn.

TLDR; Q: What is the difference between r/Entrepreneur and r/business? Or, what is the difference between entrepreneurism (besides that its not a real word) and business?

Long (boring) version

My opinion, well, first, my brief background:

I am a Mechanical Engineer with masters degree who worked as a professional in the power generation industry for 10 years and then emigrated to the US recently, half (unsuccessfully) looking for a job and half (looking at starting a company). I have too many eggs in too many baskets. I have done Udacity's Self Driving Car and FullStack Developer Nanodegrees, and learned with pramp and 'cracking the coding interview' to appreciate data structures and algorithms and the kinds of problems developers must solve. So I can code and build stuff. I like data (eveyone does) and have spent a lot of time building stuff with tableau public. My money I have saved (not a lot, when converted to USD from my '3rd world' upbringing) is all in Tesla, as it is the most logical place to put it (please don't debate me on that in this forum - just sharing my background).

I want to build a company and understand the obvious leveraging that software allows one. But no matter where I go, from indiehackers, to reddit, everything about entrepreneurism is either: start with basics mow lawns, and then buy the mowers and have a yard service to........... make billions!

The the only thing in between are not tangible - seo, marketing, saas, following leads, productivity apps, selling courses on online marketing and branding, selling courses on coding interviews, selling courses on self improvement, etc. Anyway, I am not selling anything and have nothing to get you onto (I do have a tangible business which I hope will work, but who knows).",4056,True,1533147724.0,2018-08-01 20:22:04,1,0,supalist,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/93rji3/clarification_on_business_vs_entrepreneur/,True,1.0,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

Elon:

* 7,000 model SEX vehicles in the last month of June. Mind blowing. Multiple weeks in July. Many late nights / weekends and smart ideas. Market share has surpassed all midsize premium sedans. We do not think it'll stop there. Looking really positive. Couldn't ask for better reviews from the toughest critics in the world. Our customers are our primary salesforce.  We need to get the cars out there. 
* Soon will have the P3D and RWD in all stores. 
* On Sunday testing the direct delivery, the guy who bought had never even sat in a Model 3. He said he loved it. It's amazing. Seems to be well received. 
* Potential for our existing lines to produce far more cars is **MUCH GREATER THAN EXPECTED**. Simplifying production lines, speeding them up, etc. 
* Our goal is to be profitable for every quarter going forward provided the economy is well and were' not in a recession.
* Sorry if I sound tired. I've been working in the body shop recently like crazy
* I'll have the Tesla team introduce themselves. (software tech, vision in neural net, self-driving tech that we've been working on for 3 years, plug in and replacement for the existing computer.)

Stewart:  

* Lots of focus on AP V9.0. Understand what lane the car is in, where the route the user wants to go, etc. Tap the navigate button and drag down.. and it would automatically navigate you to your home and work.

The rest mostly makes sense, but these two rules are fucking retarded.

Number of reports is not a legitimate metric to determine if something should be censored or not, that's called mob rule and is an invitation for politically-motivated randoms to tactically censor information. Where's the part about human intervention to confirm whether or not the content is actually objectionable (or just unpopular with certain demographics who are unscrupulous enough to mass-report it)?

And according to the second rule, Musk himself would be banned from this subreddit, as calling people pedos without evidence is a perfect example of both ""attacking others"" and ""offensive language"".

Where is the rule about trying to pushing blatant propaganda that's been debunked over and over, such as Tesla getting more subsidies than others car companies?

Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson are major shareholders who probably approve of the private buyout and have thus recused themselves from the decision.

Elon Musk and Steve Jurvetson are also major SpaceX shareholders, and if the buyout consortium includes SpaceX that's another conflict of interest that requires them to recuse themselves from the board decision.

Right.  My post was specifically just clarifying the ""valid avenue of material information distribution channel"".  It did not make an asserting either way regarding language used WRT to financing.  

I was incredulous of implied assertions that Tesla didn't previously inform investors of that channel (because that'd seem to be legally idiotic(?), and I think it's generally been more insightful to assume sanity/rationality on Elon and Tesla's part) and not surprised to both find the assertion false and find that naive viewpoint is glibly repeated by media's talking heads (since they're all too often about [hot takes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_take) (glib provocative narratives) and clicks] rather than slower boring nuanced accuracy.)

""Goldman Sachs Group Inc. hadn’t been formally tapped as a financial adviser by Tesla Inc.’s chief executive officer when Musk revealed plans last week to take the automaker private and said he’d secured the funding for the transaction, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Musk said on Twitter late Monday that he’s working with Goldman Sachs and private-equity firm Silver Lake as financial advisers to take Tesla private. Such a statement from a public company CEO typically signals a formal agreement. And in a normal go-private process, a senior executive like Musk would have detailed plans from those advisers on funding sources before disclosing the take-private effort. ""

""Silver Lake appears to be in a similar situation. Reuters reported Monday that the firm hasn’t been hired as an adviser in an official capacity, and the Financial Times reported that Silver Lake was unaware of Musk’s plan when it was announced last week.""

post,99fjgi,,Tesla. Bought 100 shares at $305. Why so much hate.,"30 years old. 60% of net worth in Wealthfront/Betterment/Vanguard indexes, 15% cash, 15% stocks, 10% gold and other assets.

I own 3 stocks now (up from 2). I buy stocks to sell in my retirement (obviously if they are big short term gains I can swap out at LT gains). JNJ, Alphabet, and now Tesla.

&#x200B;

So I just bought Tesla shares against the advice of what seems like everyone here.

Here are my reasons for buying:

1. Everyone I know with a Tesla says it is the best car they have ever driven in and will likely get another Tesla as their next car.
2. I would say the vast majority of people I speak to about their next car all say the same thing 'if I had the money my next car will be a Tesla'. 
3. Battery technology/production capability. I would say the odds are high that Tesla has a breakthrough innovation in the space of energy storage.
4. Home battery + solar systems is the future of the energy grid. 
5. Has anyone driven in a Ford/GM lately. They are literally JUNK on wheels. Plus the debt, legacy costs these companies carry. German/Japanese/Korean auto manufactures are good quality, but they lack either the technology innovation (electric/self-driving), or are anchored down by legacy. They can't compete with Tesla on the dealership model.
6. Smart people work at Tesla. I can't tell you how many times I meet someone who would have trouble putting a square peg through a square hole, then find out they work at a Fortune 500 (in a senior position). I've met two Tesla employees and they were very impressive. Same experience with Google.
7. Oil, environmental regulation (maybe no batteries) resistant.

The difference between Apple and Tesla is that Apple is raking in money, while Tesla is hemorrhaging money. They are not even remotely comparable.

edit: You also need to make the separation between Tesla the car and Tesla the company. I happen to generally like their cars, but I also think the company is badly mismanaged and Elon Musk is a terrible leader. IMO the best thing to happen for their future would be:

* Tesla goes chapter 11
* Creditors take over and throw Elon out
* Somebody competent gets appointed
* Tesla emerges from bankruptcy better and stronger

Of course the current owners of TSLA stock will get wiped out, but that's the lesson: you can't invest based on feelz. This exact situation happened to Ford and they are doing well now.

post,99sweh,,Investing in Green/Alternate energy!,"I am finding it really difficult to invest in this area. Investing in solar specifically has so many moving parts. You have installers like Sun Run backed by Comcast,Costco, and even MLB i believe. Sounds good but the contracts they bind you to for leasing extends 20 years. Say your panels arent fitted right (Dont put out enough power) for your place you could end up paying more for electric/solar combined. 

In regard to the tariffs. They seem to have been implemented to help companies such as First Solar, yet First Solar had a recent drop of 25%, along with Canadian Solar (these are manufacturers) . I THINK this is because even though they are American, or Canadian based, their panel manufacturing is overseas (Canadian solar is anyway but they trade similarly so im thinking its the case for both). The tariff in theory was only supposed to affect the competitors of First Solar. First Solar uses a different material that is not included in the Tariff. Maybe the uncertainty of this whole thing is what drove the market down, and Tariffs just accelerated the process. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnOdSmNQJfc - about tariffs. 

Another moving part is the price keeps dropping and the panels are getting more efficient. This seems great, but it cuts into profitability. Not only that, it also incentivizes people to wait and eventually own their solar panels. Which brings up a battery/storage issue. Tsla was supposed to be going after that with the powerwall. 
I will say in my findings, Owning a Solar panel seemed like the best way to go.

The Tesla Inc. board convened Thursday at the company's factory in Fremont, Calif., in a conference room where Elon Musk often spent the night. His sleeping bag was still on the floor. 

The agenda was Mr. Musk's audacious plan to take Tesla private, which he had sprung on the investment world 16 days earlier via tweets. He was joined in the room by board members, lawyers, bankers and advisers, members of a Wall Street transaction machine put into motion by the entrepreneur's idea. 

Mr. Musk's plan turned out more shaky than his tweets suggested. He had told the world he had funding ""secured,"" and one tweet elaborated that the deal was so certain it needed only a shareholder vote. 

As the team hustled to put form to his idea, lining up investors willing to put up the tens of billions of dollars required for the deal, Mr. Musk was having doubts, according to people familiar with this thinking. 

A buyout, even if accomplished, would force some of the technology mutual funds that had been ardent supporters to trim their stakes. It might mean allowing competitors inside his tent -- one of the investors his bankers had lined up was Volkswagen AG, people familiar with the matter said. 

Taking Tesla private also would displace legions of small-fry stockholders -- a merry band of electric-car fanatics willing to look past Tesla's rickety finances and its struggle to master the skill of mass-producing automobiles. Taking their place would be more sophisticated investors tugging on a tighter leash. 

Then there was the photo emailed to him last week from an elderly couple, dressed in Tesla Inc. T-shirts and baseball caps. The couple held up a handwritten sign congratulating Mr. Musk for producing 7,000 electric cars in seven days. Their message: ""Thanks, Elon! Two happy stockholders!"" 

Mr. Musk forwarded the email to a friend. ""Made my day,"" he wrote. It also nagged at him.",10132,True,1535339064.0,2018-08-27 05:04:24,482,188,mayurthaker,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9alhxg/wsj_funding_was_secured_but_elon_walked_away/,True,0.94,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

post,9dw4fr,,Why Tesla Energy should and will make an Air-Conditioner,"Elon on JRE last night suggested he has definitely thought of developing a new air-conditioning system. See below for the link to the video @ 2:04:20 and a quick transcription:

https://youtu.be/ycPr5-27vSI?t=2h3m4s

JR: ""Have you thought about creating an air-conditioning system?""

Elon pauses and makes a funny face as to suggest that's he definitely has...

JR: ""I think you have... trick question...""

EM: ""I cannot answer questions about future potential products.""

Perhaps this was just a whiskey-infused Elon doing what he does best, creating speculation about nothing. But, lets assume this will happen within next 5 years. Here's why this would be a smart move for Tesla Energy:

Heating and air conditioning accounts for ~50% of the average U.S. household’s energy bill each year.

$52 Bn = North American air-conditioner market estimate for 2020 by Radiant Insights, Inc

Even small advancements in tech, resulting in minor efficiency improvements would significantly decrease the size and capacity (and thus cost and materials supply/demand) of residential solar and storage products.

Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. Besides transportation, residential and commercial building energy usage is the #1 source of emissions (at least in the U.S).

The # of AC's is expected to triple from 1.6 bn units to 5.6 bn units globally by 2050 due to a warming climate and development in the Global South. Source: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/climate/air-conditioning.html

comment,9dw4fr,9dw4fr,,"I've thought about heating/AC/hot water and I have some theories:

&#x200B;

\- Heat pumps are becoming increasingly useful and efficient even in low outside temperatures. It used to be that they were useless anywhere that got to freezing, but that's no longer the case.

\- While air conditioning, you have a lot of hot refrigerant that could be used to supplement a hot water heater instead of being exhausted into the outside air. 

\- Roof-top solar gets quite hot, which could be an additional heat source for refrigerant or water when needed.

\- Right now, your refrigerator is acting like a mini-air conditioner, venting heat into your home, which your air conditioner has to overcome. Imagine how much more efficient it could be if we tied that refrigerant loop into the AC unit so we could heat water with that heat or exhaust it outside the house where it doesn't drag down the air conditioner?

\- Swimming pool and spa heaters are more and more often heat pumps. They move so much air that ducting them isn't practical or possible, but they're blasting a ton of cool/cold air out into the wild where it's wasted. What if we could link that into the Heat Pump Loop and use the waste heat from the refrigerator and air conditioner to heat the pool water?

\- This one's crazier: The water running down your shower drain is still awfully hot.

Analyst Ryan Brinkman reiterated the underweight rating he’s had on the stock for at least three years, and his price target of $195, which is 37% below Thursday’s closing price.

The SEC’s suit could “hasten the inevitable transition of Tesla shares toward being valued based upon fundamentals alone (fundamentals which we have long held do not support a value close to the current trading price),” Brinkman wrote in a note to clients.

I have been an avid supporter of Tesla since placing an order for my Signature Model S.  I can not, in good conscience, stand by and watch Elon succumb to the unjust strong arming by the questionably motivated SEC.

In the recent fan made video, a clip highlighted Elon saying that he would never give up!  I realize the weight of the world has been put on his shoulders, but kowtowing to the SEC in this matter is 100% wrong; it also signals a victory for the cancerous oil lobbyists that have been gunning for Elon since they realized they are 5-10 years behind the curve.

I am absolutely devistated, as an owner and a shareholder, that Elon would agree to admit he was wrong when he has already emphatically stated that he rejects the SEC’s claims of acting unethically.

The intent must be examined; and there was never an intent for his tweet to manipulate the market.  The only manipulation has, for YEARS, been the greedy short position holder that constantly spew negative stories, unsubstantiated claims, and target attack without merit.

I stand by Elon, Tesla, and the world view being held by so many of your supporters.

Please! Do not let Elon lose this battle... he deserves better!

post,9k9167,,Elon Musk's Volunteer Army Out in Force at Buzzing Tesla Outlets,"
Elon Musk got sued and quickly settled with the SEC? Whatever. The big news for Janet Beach was finally getting her hands on the wheel of the Tesla Model 3 she ordered 18 months ago.

“I bought it without driving it, that’s how much confidence I have,” said Beach, who picked up her sedan in Bellevue, Washington. She hasn’t lost faith in the company that made it, or in its chief executive officer. Controversy is to be expected. “There’s to be a little bit of negative commentary as he pursues his dream of changing the world.”

There was a lot of that kind of talk over the weekend, as Tesla Inc. counted down to the final hours of the quarter ending at midnight Sunday and tallied the numbers of how many electric cars it could churn out and deliver to customers. Will Tesla show there’s enough demand for electric cars for them to enter the mainstream -- and as money-makers?

Musk has given assurances that the company is on the verge of being out of the red after reporting its largest-ever loss in the last quarter, and that production of the Model 3 is finally humming. He told employees in an email obtained by Bloomberg News that profitability was in sight. If the last push to boost deliveries beats the clock with big numbers, he said, “we will achieve an epic victory beyond all expectations.”

He had been as upbeat as ever going into the weekend, seemingly unperturbed by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s fraud lawsuit accusing him of falsely claiming in a tweet that he had the funding lined up to go private. A settlement agreement reached Saturday requires Musk to relinquish his post as chairman for three years while allowing him to stay on as CEO.

“Ignore all distractions,” Musk said Friday in an another email to employees obtained by Bloomberg News. “One more hardcore weekend and we will be victorious.",6001,True,1538334568.0,2018-09-30 21:09:28,184,40,Potatochak,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9k9167/elon_musks_volunteer_army_out_in_force_at_buzzing/,True,0.9,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

post,9kobe4,,Are the short sellers running a campaign to lower TSLA stock price?,"I am pissed about how Elon Musk is being treated. Am I not getting it, or is this how it is?

Here is my semi-informed opinion. 

&#x200B;

Elon Musk and Tesla Motors have done amazing things so far. They have revolutionized vehicle design and manufacturing in a very short time, and singlehandedly created the market for electric cars.  


At Tesla, he set seemingly impossible goal and consistently meets it, although usually a little later than his original ambitious plan.  


They have revolutionized the auto industry and vehicle design, and are now about to earn more revenue than they are reinvesting in new vehicle design and their charging infrastructure.

&#x200B;

After a nine-month delay, they are finally meeting their ambitious production targets for the Model 3 (estimated at 53,000 for the third quarter 2018 vs 50,000 to 55,000 target).  


So, Tesla and Musk obviously deserve to be celebrated for a stunning victory for American design and manufacturing.  


But instead, they are being hounded by media, wall street and the SEC.  


That's because some very powerful people bet against Tesla, and don't want to lose money. So, they are using the government people and media that they own to bring down the company.  


If they succeed, the next American success story is less likely to happen.  


Musk and Tesla need our support.  


Reach out to your representative and Senator to let them know that you notice what the SEC is doing.

post,9pb3wf,,Model X needed in San Jose for TwitchCon 2018!,"Good Morning, enthusiasts!   


I am reaching out on behalf of my client, Goodtimeswithscar (social links below). He will be traveling to San Jose, CA for the annual TwitchCon, which will be taking place October 25th through October 28th. Ryan (“Scar”) is in a wheelchair, but his companion will be helping him get to the panels he is a guest on, as well as his other speaking engagements while he is in town. The entire TwitchCon trip will be vlogged, and uploaded to his various social channels - some will even be live-streamed when necessary. He speaks on gamers with disabilities, and how he has overcome the obstacles and how others can, too. He is a member of the most successful Minecraft server community in existence, HermitCraft, which collectively sees millions of video and stream views per week across YouTube and Twitch. He also has a charity through St. Jude that provides gaming console stations to both children and adults whom have been hospitalized for serious conditions.   


He is an avid supporter of Tesla, as well as fascinated by Elon and his many endeavors. Scar wears his Boring Company cap proudly, as can be seen in some of his YouTube videos. That considered, the guy has never even sat in a Tesla!   
To make TwitchCon 2018 extra special for him, I am looking to Tesla, as well as the Tesla owner's community to see if there is any chance that you’d would be able to provide a Model X for his transportation? We would need the vehicle from Thursday afternoon (10/25), through Sunday Afternoon (10/28) - arriving at SFO, and departing from SJC. I would be the person driving him, and hold a valid California state driver’s license. The vehicle would be discussed in a positive light in some of his vlogs and live streams, which would include showing how accommodating the Model X can be of a wheelchair and travel luggage, among its many other incredible features.

post,9pnn1z,,Tesla makes significant changes to Model 3 versions and nixes Full Self Driving option ordering,"So as of last night Tesla made some significant changes to the actual versions of the Model 3 that can be order going forward.  They aren't selling the LR version anymore and you need to get an AWD or Perf version for the biggest battery pack.  There's now a Medium Range version with a slightly smaller battery and slightly smaller price ($45,000 w/ 260mi EPA estimated range vs $49,0000 w/ 310mi range on the prior LR version).  

Source: https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1053060766771761152

Additionally the option to order the FSD package has been completely removed.  With Elon Musk stating it was because it was causing 'confusion'.

Source: https://electrek.co/2018/10/19/tesla-removes-full-self-driving-capability-package-confusion/

This is a pretty big shakeup, perhaps even more than Elon Musk buying $20M worth of stock.  Naturally speculation is running rampant on both these issues.  If LR demand has crashed, why it was removed if this about better segmentation, etc.  And even more so on the FSD front with concerns over regulators potentially getting involved about Tesla taking money for a product they flat out haven't been able to deliver in 2 years or alternatively concerns over upgrade costs for their new hardware and chip going forward.

post,9qk2ps,,Tesla Miles Travelled vs ICE Miles Travelled per kg CO2 in California,"Eventually, we'll all have this conversation right?  Someone who knows you have a Tesla will repeat the story they've heard somewhere, ""Yeah, your Tesla's electric.  But when you take the *entire cycle of creating electricity* into account it's not as good as an efficient ICE car.""  A co-worker today challenged me.

Well, I live in California.  So I ran the numbers for California, using statistics published by the US Department of Energy.

So, according to the US Energy Information Administration ([www.eia.gov](http://www.eia.gov/)) “How much CO2 is produced per KWH?” is a FAQ. Here: [https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=74&t=11](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=74&t=11)

And they publish generation and emissions statistics per state:

[https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/emission\_annual.xls](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/emission_annual.xls)

[https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/annual\_generation\_state.xls](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/annual_generation_state.xls)

So, in 2016 California produced a total of 197 Billion kWh of electricity from all sources. (197 Million mWh)

In 2016 California emitted 47 Billion Kg of CO2 from the total electric power industry. (47 Million Metric Tons)

So, 197/47 or 4.2 kWh per kg of CO2.

On my recent road trip to Tahoe and back, I used 282 Wh per mile.  Not particularly great for a Tesla.  But it \*is\* Tahoe.

4200Wh / 282Wh/mi = 14.9 mi

*So, 14.9 miles per kg of CO2 produced.*

That’s ignoring any transmission losses, and any losses in charging the car (but the main losses are \***generation**\* losses, reflected above, not \***transmission**\* losses in the grid itself)

So, how much CO2 is produced by burning gasoline in an ICE car?

Some quick numbers I found show a fully loaded fuel semi will get about 6 mpg, and 10 mpg empty. Couldn't find any numbers on average distance traveled to deliver fuel, but I imagine some routes are quite significant. A fuel truck creates 1 kg of carbon every .89 miles. There are approximately 150,000 refueling stations in the US. That's a lot of carbon burning just to enable more carbon burning.

Another good talking point is the electric grid gets cleaner every day. The ICE engine seems like it's mostly tapped out on mpg improvements.

**Deliveries**

As usual, Tesla’s vehicle deliveries drive most of its earning results, since vehicle sales represent the automaker’s main revenue stream at the moment.

[Tesla already confirmed its third quarter 2018 deliveries: 83,500 vehicles](https://electrek.co/2018/10/02/tesla-q3-production-deliveries/) – a new record for the company thanks to the Model 3 production ramp proving effective in yielding great numbers.

The delivery breakdown for the quarter was:

* 55,840 Model 3
* 14,470 Model S
* 13,190 Model X

Model 3 not only did well, but Model S and Model X deliveries were also both significantly higher quarter-over-quarter (those numbers are adjusted slightly during the release of the earnings).

Here are Tesla’s quarterly global deliveries of all current vehicles in production since their launches:

post,9sgfga,,If Tesla sold modular ICE conversion Kits.,"It occurred to me Tesla could pivot the entire existing 'auto - repair' industry to accelerate sustainable mobility if they started a catalog of ICE replacement components. This would allow struggling old mechanic shops to turn into 'conversion' shops, giving them a foothold in the future instead of slowly falling off the EV cliff.

* Maybe 2 sizes of motor unit that fit the space of a normal rear-axle transfer case.
   * (doesn't have to be premium power size)
   * could even include EV drive hybrid conversions that drop the transmission & but keep the existing ICE to power a much smaller battery.
* A bolt-in gas tank replacement battery pack. (not enough on its own.. but easy to fill space)
* A battery + control electronics 'block' that can replace engine + transmission of an average size.
* An 'auxiliary belt' small motor mount kit to drive AC / Pressurized systems.  (or simply electric motor driven steering / ac pumps)

Tesla is definitely the only manufacturer close to a battery cost to make 'kits' like this workable.. but if they did they could launch a whole new industry  .. once again accelerating the transition to sustainable mobility.  and at the same time picking up all the 'body & option' packages of all ICE competitors.


edit: Terrible example that probably doesn't help.   Auto-Shops become like 'Car-Toys'  replacing mechanical Tape-decks & CD players with  MP3 / BlueTooth audio decks.

post,9sk4vh,,Annoying AC compressor shutdown noise - afraid service center will tell me it’s normal,"Hey everyone! First time posting on here! I’d say I’m a pretty big Tesla enthusiast; I have an AP1 S P85D and an AP1 X P90DL, and just recently added an AP2 X 100D! The first two Teslas were absolutely perfect when I got them, so I could never really identify with all of the build quality complaints I’d seen when it came to Tesla. 

But this Model X was built right in the middle of the great Model 3 ramp, and it’s lacking in many aspects. I’ve given it to the service center to get these issues sorted out, but based on the feedback I’ve gotten from the service center thus far, I’m afraid they might refuse to fix the most annoying of them: a [very loud and deep whirring noise](https://youtu.be/DTlHod4Nbgc) that happens on its own EVERY 3-5 MINUTES when the AC is active, but can also be provoked by cranking up the AC all the way, letting it run for a bit and then shutting it off. 

In a call today, the service center representative told me that they are still in the process of determining whether or not this sound is normal. I know that this sound does not happen in neither my other Model X nor my Model S, but I don’t know what to do if they say it’s “within specifications”. 

The X is really amazing in every other way, especially with AP2 and V9, so I’d hate for this to ruin my experience. Do you have any experience with or information about this issue? Do you know what causes it, or what I can tell the service center to get it fixed?

Thanks!

SOLVED: Got it back from the service center, this is resolved now.

post,9v2xeo,,The electric future has arrived,"One of my coworkers is thinking about buying a new car. Naturally I was trying to convince her to buy the Model 3. It fits the approximate budget she and her husband have for their next car, and as a Tesla investor I took it upon myself to convince her to at least consider the Model 3. She and her husband like cars but I think they share an ignorance that the general public has about how far Tesla has come in the past few years. Her first response to the suggestion of buying a Tesla?


**""Yeah but electric cars don't have as good of performance as gas powered cars.""**


I opened up YouTube and showed her videos of the P100D beating a Ferrari, Porsche, or any number of other supercars in quarter mile drag races. Her response?


**""Oh that's interesting, but don't Teslas cost like a hundred grand?""**


Next I pulled up the Tesla website, showing the Model 3 with a 0-60 time of 3.3 seconds and a base price of $46k (edit: at the base price the Model 3 does 0-60 in 5.6 seconds). Her next line, which I knew was coming...


**""Okay but that would never work because the range isn't good enough. I couldn't drive home to visit my parents.""**


I pull up Google Maps to find the distance between her place and her parents house (DC to Greensboro, NC). 309 miles. Almost exactly the range of the Model 3.


**""That's pretty good but where do I charge it? I need to wait another 5 years or so for all the charging stations to be built!""**


I open the Tesla supercharger map and show her that there are no fewer than 8 charging stations already open along her route, conveniently located just off the highway where she is already stopping for food, bathrooms, etc. At this point she was pretty much out of rebuttals, but I could tell she was still not convinced.

Today’s podcast episode is going to focus on why Congo has been unable to translate this natural resource wealth into prosperity for ordinary people. In part one, I will discuss the paternalistic policies of the Belgian Congo and how the left the country unprepared for independence. In part two, I will discuss the corruption of the Mobutu regime, and how the mining industry collapsed under his rule. Finally, in part three I will discuss the current transformation of Congo’s mining industry, and the pivotal role the Congo will play in the rise of electric cars.

Many of my readers are likely familiar with the ruthless rule of King Leopold in the Congo Free State that cost the lives as many as 8 million Africans. If not, I strongly recommend reading [King Leopold’s Ghost](https://www.amazon.com/King-Leopolds-Ghost-Heroism-Colonial/dp/0618001905), by Adam Hochschild. The Belgian government took over the administration of 1908, and very much took “the White Man’s Burden” seriously. By 1960, the Belgian Congo had eradicated the tsetse fly from populated areas, and the highest literacy rate in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there was a very real dark side to Belgian rule in the Congo. Exploitation and coercion where everywhere. The government forced Congolese to work one sixth of the year on public works projects, and private corporations had the power to force Africans to work on plantations.",6312,True,1542082400.0,2018-11-13 05:13:20,1,0,gnikivar2,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/9wlpcd/king_coppers_ghost_the_democratic_republic_of_the/,True,1.0,2018,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,9xii2t,,Tesla Charger Snow Cover ideas,"Here in Southern Ontario we've had our first blast of winter.

I've had a bit of the stuck door handle and windows not lowering due to cold/ice issues.  I've also had a lot of cars (subarus) with frameless windows and at this temperature never had this issue.  Anyway - I'm sure it will get sorted out, but right now I'm using a ziplock bag with a hole in it for the Tesla Home Charger wand.... trying to keep moisture and snow from freezing in the port and making it hard to pull the charger out.

So I've been looking to see what's out there (and there isn't really anything) .... but came across a couple of 1772 snow covers for Volts/Bolts.  They look like they could be just what's needed.

Last Friday $TSLA closed at **$354** ... If he's still short Tesla then Einhorn's Christmas is not going to be particularly happy.

So this is only the beginning of the suffering of the ~29 million $TSLA shares still sold short.

Last Friday $TSLA closed at $354 ...

If Einhorn is still short Tesla then it's going to be a very difficult to write fourth quarter letter to investors. He should also start checking how well his personal wealth is segregated legally from the funds he is managing.

post,9yku57,,Failed Delivery Process - Need to Vent and Need advice,"I've been a lurker on this sub for a while and I need to vent about the past 24 hours and ask for advice for what to do next.  I was a reservation holder for a model 3 since the day it was announced but in the last few years, my family has grown with the addition of a new child and dog.  So after much deliberation, my wife and I decided to get a new 2018 Model S 75D instead.  We were very excited for our scheduled delivery yesterday afternoon. However, we never got our car yesterday.
First, after the initial check in process and signing of paperwork, we waited at the Mt Kisco site for just under 2 hours because they had trouble registering our new car at the DMV site.  Fine.  Finally got new plates and we were shuttled over to a warehouse where they said our car would be.  It wasn't there and we had to wait there another hour until they realized it was back at the original site where we checked in.  
They finally got us to our car over 3 hours after our initially appointment time.  We were going through our walk through of the car when both screen blacked out and failed to reboot.  A couple of representatives tried rebooting the system to no avail.  Due to the fussy baby and with closing time approaching, we were told that it was probably just a software update and they would try the update in the morning and deliver it to us to our house in the afternoon.  
Got a phone call this morning saying they were ""running diagnostics"" and they should be still ok to deliver it in the afternoon.  No more updates for the rest of the morning.
I called the delivery center back and find out that they need to replace a part and now won't get delivery until Wednesday at the earliest.  
I'm am very frustrated right now.

post,9zsww8,,"How different people perceive value in a car, an essay of sorts.","So I realize it may seem like im talking on a soapbox here but this is a thought that i've had these thoughts in my head for a while now so I figured why not put it out there for some discussion. Think of your dream car, think of the car that makes you go ""one day!"" and then think of the price tag and why that price is justified. You ask enough people this and you will get very different answers because people have very different wants and needs when it comes to cars which is something I feel like a lot of people forget.

Here's an example, look at a new base Mustang and then look at a new base Miata. Both cars start at around 25k but both are valued for different reasons. The Mustang starts with 310 hp while the Miata starts at only 155 hp. Someone looking for 0-60 times might call the Miata a rip-off but the people who buy Miatas aren't looking for 0-60 times, they're looking for handling. While the Miata has less horsepower than a new Toyota Camry they have become almost synonymous with handling with few cars in its price range being able to handle themselves in a turn like the Miata. On the flip side the Miata would be easily destroyed in a straight drag race by the base level Mustang.

I feel like a lot of car enthusiasts view the car world only through what they desire in a car which can lead to a lot of toxicity in the community. Yes a challenger scat pack can easily beat a Lexus LS500 in a race for a fraction of the price but the $75,000 price tag of the Lexus is a result of its luxury features such as rear seat massages, climate controls that read the occupants body temperatures, etc. With the Tesla model 3 a $55,000 price tag for a car that at its slowest option only goes 0-60 in 5.5 seconds may sound like a rip off but is justified by the cutting edge tech in the car. 55k for a 5.5 second car is a ripoff but what about 55k for a car with autopilot and the ability to predict and dodge accidents on its own?",2580,True,1543013099.0,2018-11-23 23:44:59,15,19,AutumnMuffin,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/9zsww8/how_different_people_perceive_value_in_a_car_an/,True,0.8,2018,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,a6ayda,,"Need Your referral code, but not for a regular reason.","Hey fans, enthusiasts.


I’m a **fanboy from Europe** since around 2014 and, as lot of You, my daily life can not be satisfied without some new video, interesting thread or news article about anything related to Elon, Tesla and SpaceX. I was a shareholder for some time, but bailed out due to me being overly emotional on **untruthful and harmful** information about person and companies I love like a family members since 2015, when Elon [with his bs promises about landing orbital rockets and delivering electric car that I can afford] kept me rooting for life.

During this period I realized that most of information Youtube and other influencers put out there is lacking a lot of facts with regards to ‘pre-this year’ information and written first hand interviews like Elon’s autobiography by A. Vance (He’s actually trying to make a movie now). The guys that actually make a good insightful information (Teslanomics, Rian, Clean Technica) does it in a way not interesting for some demography.

Also,
 I’m a biology bachelor and climate change issue for me is very personal due to first hand research experience (with regards to freshwater ecosystem).


However, what I realized is that my knowledge and enthusiasm could actually be redirected towards useful stuff during the time, when complete  content is lacking and there isn’t an easy to understand and interesting source for people who seek it.

If they sell their cars for cash, then no, they don't have to raise cash.  On a big portion of sales they either write a loan on the car & hold the paper, or lease the car.  In those cases, they only get money in small monthly payments.  

In the meantime, they have spent cash to build a car -- with 4 year leases and 8 year loans (just checked Tesla's website) and 20% gross margins, it would take roughly 3 years on a lease to break even and 6 years on a loan.  

It's hard for a fast growing company to be cash flow positive when it takes 3 to 6 years to get back the cost of goods sold on a significant portion of inventory.   

So if the market if favorable, they sell some of the leases & loans to accelerate growth.

June 27, 2017 to current date has seen Tesla’s stock price remain range bound between \~$387.70 and $246.55, with price currently trading near the top of the range and closing on Friday, December 14, 2018 at $365.71.

The range bound market since June 27, 2017 is identified in this Tesla analysis as a rectangle top pattern, which is ideally bearish.

Also important to keep in mind is the long term bullish trendline which is anticipated to provide support if bearish momentum picks up to the downside or the bottom of the range ($246.55) as mentioned above.

Point of invalidation (POI) of this analysis is price closing above the top of the current range.

I try to maintain a running list of the current economic situation at all times since I trade based on current global news.  I'm looking for some commentary on my current list:

  

**Pros**

Super cheap oil - this helps consumer spending and emerging markets, but hurts the S&P and oil exporters (a segment of the US now). Google the article “The American Consumer Is On Track To Save $40 Billion In Annual Energy Costs”. Every one cent decrease in gas prices saves the consumer $1 billion in yearly energy costs!

Corporate tax cuts are permanent unless congress repeals them - why are people under the impression that this is a one-time stimulus and will wear off?

Potential for at least a temporary trade deal and cut in tariffs to see if China makes due on its promises (my hunch)

Low unemployment - historically this means we’re closer to the next recession though

Some pockets of potential stock value

Historically low interest rates

Household debt ratio is OK

**Cons**

Trump instability.

Russia investigation. 

Strong dollar - hurts US exports and emerging markets. Where will this be in 2019?

Market pessimism and downward momentum

Global growth worries - will these prove to be well justified in affecting US corporate profits?

Yield curve is flattening, though historically it has been this flat and growth continues for years to come

Fed balance sheet unwind - Fed needs to sell lots of securities. Low treasury prices drive up safe yields and make bonds look more attractive, driving down stock prices. 

Fed raising interest rates, though rates are still low historically speaking.

QE unwind. Will bonds end up getting crushed eventually?

Trade war - who long will it go on and what will be the effect? Will Trump fold because of the stock market crashing?

Brexit

Isolationism getting popular hurting trade and the global economy

and was wondering why the model 3 is such a big deal and why they experienced the problems they had listed in that article. Isn't an all-EV car supposed to be simpler to make and repair than a conventional ICE car and certainly easier than a hybrid (which has both technologies)? If I remember correctly hybrid tech became available in 1900 and some hybrid tanks were even made during WWII. The technology has been reliable and available to consumers since at least as far back as the Gen I Prius (2001). Seems to me that these days cars don't change much except in terms of gadgets and onboard 3G/4G LTE with the exception of some new transmissions being tried out (Nissan Versa CVT) and in the case of EVs new battery tech, but I don't think Musk invented any new battery tech, they just copied the most modern commercially available tech to get the most energy density. So my questions are:

1. Why are EVs still so expensive? It's literally not worth it to buy them unless you're a cab driver stuck in stand-still traffic daily.
2. Why did Musk have so much difficulty perfecting the car for the factory when logically it would seem an EV would be easier to make?

comment,a8zuie,a8zuie,,">Why are EVs still so expensive? It's literally not worth it to buy them unless you're a cab driver stuck in stand-still traffic daily.

Batteries are still very expensive. The price has come down a lot in recent years, but they're still very expensive to manufacture. 


>Why did Musk have so much difficulty perfecting the car for the factory when logically it would seem an EV would be easier to make?

Building a modern car is very hard. There are tens of thousands of hours and billions of dollars put into their development. Every other manufacturer has decades of experience perfecting their manufacturing process. Tesla itself is only 15 years old and they're only been seriously making cars for 6 years. They just don't have that same level of experience that others have. 


>Why do Teslas typically have more capacity than other cars like Nissan's Leaf? Just bigger cells?

I think there are two main reasons for this. Firstly, Teslas are bigger and heavier than most EVs. As a result, they need to store more energy. It's like how gas cars use bigger and more powerful engines in big cars. When you compare Teslas to similarly sized EVs, their battery capacity is very similar. 

The second part of this is that other EVs typically have had different goals than Teslas. Teslas aim to be a complete and total replacement to gas cars. They're made to allow you to take road trips or drive longer distances. Other EVs have historically been compliance cars.",1742,True,1545613849.0,2018-12-24 02:10:49,14,0,Fugner,cars,https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/a8zuie/why_is_tesla_model_3_such_a_big_deal/ecffvln/,True,,2018,both,search,False,False,0,ecffvln

Tesla previously gave investors hope that its production rates would improve, saying that the number of labor hours to build the Model 3 fell by more than 30 percent from the second to the third quarter. The company also told investors in late October that it took less time to build than the Model S sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle — another first for the company.

""We will focus even further on cost improvements while continuing to increase our production rate"" during the fourth quarter, the company said at the time.

CEO Elon Musk announced Oct. 23 that the company planned to limit certain options on its higher-end Model S sedans and Model X SUVs to streamline production. The company also announced plans during the fourth quarter to start selling a $45,000 version of the Model 3, before raising the price $46,000. It has yet to produce the base Model 3, which it has promised for a price of $35,000 before incentives.

The fourth quarter marked an end to a $7,500 federal tax credit that Tesla was able to use to lure buyers in the past. That was cut in half to $3,750 starting Jan. 1.",1406,False,1546436557.0,2019-01-02 14:42:37,845,361,closingbell,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/abti79/tesla_misses_wall_street_estimates_with_90700/,True,0.93,2019,both,search,False,False,0,

post,adxl0r,,C7 Grand Sport Owner's Review of a 2016 Tesla Model X,"So I got married this weekend and my friend decided to rent a 90D Tesla Model X for the wedding to help chauffeur family members around. I ended up driving the car for about (3) days and here are my impressions on the following: Power, Handling, Practicality, Style, Build Quality, and Overall Driving Experience. 

**Power (Powah!)** 

I drove a Model X 90D a few years ago at a Tesla dealership when looking for a new car for my dad. I was impressed with the power then, but the dealership driving experience was only about 15 minutes and was very much about showing all of the car's features so it was hard to really get a grasp for the car's power. 

In driving it around the past few days I got a much better sense of the car's power delivery and it is pretty enjoyable. 

The electric motors and AWD system give the car a near instantaneous and perfectly tractioned power delivery at all times. You put the pedal down and you begin to feel the car surge forward in proportion to how much throttle you are giving it. 

We've all heard the stories of Teslas slaying other cars in drag races and torching nearly everyone from 0-60. The 90D has a 0-60 time slated at around 4.8 seconds, which is fast but nowhere near legendary, but to be honest the car felt much stronger than that. 

A big reason for this is because the Model X doesn't have to change gears and can respond to throttle input very rapidly. Sure other cars can do 0-60 in say 4 seconds, but they have to be in the right gear, with the right surface, and with enough traction to make that pull possible. Too much throttle input and the car breaks traction, too little and you missed your shot at the perfect 4 seconds. 

With the Model X when you put your foot down the car immediately goes ""alright this is the maximum amount of power I can give you without breaking traction"" and I've never seen a car react so quickly to driver input.",28641,True,1546973685.0,2019-01-08 19:54:45,50,70,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/adxl0r/c7_grand_sport_owners_review_of_a_2016_tesla/,True,0.73,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,am7nz5,,Business Start Up - Clean Out/Clean Up Crew - Willing to Trade Expertise,"To begin, I managed the day to day operations at a small transportation company, specifically semi trucks, for about 7-8 years and still manage the company's financials from home. I basically pay the bills, make sure the day to day manager has money to make the business function properly for the week, and balance the checking account. It's something my dad started while I was in school and I took over in 2008 when I graduated. It has had its up and downs but I can't complain, I put about two hours a week into it and it pays almost all our bills.

&#x200B;

Late 2015, I noticed I was playing on my phone far more than I was actually working. My dad raised my brother and I doing construction and home remodeling. I asked him to teach me because I was no longer needed at the trucking company on a regular basis. Fast forward about 3 years and here we are building pole barns, remodeling/flipping homes, and doing almost everything you could do under a residential roof five days a week. He's 62 years old and has really dropped out of the work lineup for us as of late. He is suppose to cap some windows tomorrow but we'll see if it really happens. He deserves a nice retirement. I like him being able to come and go and not worry about the jobs. I owe him a lot.

&#x200B;

Another business venture I have been reading about is working with banks and homeowners and cleaning out repossessed homes. This led me to researching crime set cleanup (murder, suicide, drugs, etc). I'm not even sure what the proper name of the profession is called. However, I'm interested.

&#x200B;

Why I am posting here is because I want to expand myself. I want to start a clean out/clean up business but I know little of how to get started. Of course I am going to need a vendors' license, insurance, bond, etc. but I am not too sure how I could get my foot in the door quickly.

post,apd855,,Discussion - How Will Enthusiasts Modify Electric Vehicles?,"What follows below are my thoughts on how you can modify EVs for better performance after doing some research online. Obviously, I want to hear from you guys about how else you could go about modding an EV. I know a lot of you out there are quite knowledgeable. That being said, here's my two cents:

As electric vehicles take over pretty much every market segment - everything from commuter cars to high performance side-by-sides (Nikola NZT) - there will eventually be those who wish to modify electric vehicles for better performance, and thus, an aftermarket will form to cater to them. This will probably become commonplace as more used electric vehicles enter the market. The question is, how do you go about modifying an electric vehicle in the first place? In comparison to an ICE vehicle, EVs are very simple. There isn't as much to modify in general. There are certain mods that will be exactly the same as they are today; weight reduction, suspension, wheels, gear ratio changes, etc. But what about the powertrain itself?

\- REFLASHING:

Similar to ECU tuning  today, software modification could allow for better performance as many EVs come de-tuned from factory. The Nissan Leaf Nismo is an example of this. The only difference between the standard Leaf and the Nismo is a body kit, wheels, and a software reprogram.

\- HIGHER VOLTAGE CABLES

As you begin working with more power, the rest of the drivetrain will need to be up to par. Higher voltage cables could be a ""Stage 1"" mod in the future, similar to installing new valves/valve springs as you build an engine. 

\- AFTERMARKET CONTROLLERS/COMPUTERS

The EV equivalent of a standalone ECU (like a MoTeC). These would allow you full control over tuning the car yourself rather than needing to reprogram the stock computer. An example of this today is the EV West Tesla Motor kit which comes with an aftermarket controller that allows for fine-tuning.",3481,True,1549864603.0,2019-02-11 06:56:43,10,24,SquidBonez,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/apd855/discussion_how_will_enthusiasts_modify_electric/,True,0.73,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Given how it's uncertain if gas stations will be able to afford staying open, I had a thought that electric converted gas stations (equipped with powerwall type storage options) could plug into local utilities and act as the neighborhood failsafes like in the case of surges, blackouts or high demand.
Additionally you could add solar to the gas station and/or top up the on-site storage overnight (lower rates if sourced from utilities) to resell at higher rates later. 
A way for the owners of these stations to make money from the failsafe service could be a monthly fee paid by utility customers. This would be in combination with the BEV charging stalls.

I noticed it seems to replace their [2012 study](https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/icriecr.pdf). Similar text, new data.

Here is the PDF: [Global equity investing: The benefits of diversification and sizing your allocation](https://www.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGGEB.pdf) (Feb 2019)

It's fairly short, but if you don't feel like reading it, here's what I gleaned:

* The U.S. represents 55.1% of the equity market, versus 44.9% for international, as of Sept. 2018. [Image](https://i.imgur.com/9C0RIpU.png).
* U.S. stocks have the lowest volatility of any country, but a **global market provides the lowest volatility**. [Image](https://i.imgur.com/xUGAI4a.png).
* Vanguard's data suggests **maximum volatility reduction was achieved with a 40-50% international allocation** (but why not just invest in a global market cap weighted index?).
* **Emerging markets should be market weighted, too**. They have delivered ""higher average returns, albeit with higher volatility, than those of developed markets."" However, individual EMs are uncorrelated, so the risk of investing in all of them is lower.
* **Currency exposure risks from international investing are minimal**, and in some cases, reduce volatility.
* **U.S. investors don't benefit as much from international as investors in other countries**. Vanguard's ten year, forward-looking model showed maximum volatility reduction in the U.S. at 4%, the UK at 9%, Canada at 11%, and Australia at 15% (roughly). [Image](https://i.imgur.com/9qudtX3.png).
* **Over-weighting U.S. or international stocks leads to sector overexposure and risk**. U.S. companies skew towards technology, biotech, and software, while other countries have more ""old world"" industries such as electrical equipment and automobiles (Vanguard's 2012 study). A global portfolio more accurately captures the market weight of all these industries.

post,avequb,,Electric Car Market Overview (comprehensive interactive chart),"We have been building an EV comparison service and decided to create a useful and simple tool that gives you a birds-eye view of the market. It is available to anyone free of charge: 

 [**https://evcompare.io/market/**](https://evcompare.io/market/) 

&#x200B;

The EV Market Overview looks like this:

[EV Market Overview](https://preview.redd.it/jyd7hfjco4j21.png?width=2776&format=png&auto=webp&s=c49f3a42987c91d20de42cc519fed610b3a9bc0d)

**How to use it?**

1. Choose the cars you want to compare or analyze the entire market. You have a whole set of filters at your disposal. Filter by body style, price, make, status, drive type or DC charging capability.
2. Select the specs to be shown on each axis. The following options are available: Range, Battery pack capacity, Acceleration, Engine Power, Engine Torque and Efficiency.
3. Watch how do different electric models compare on your custom chart and discover interesting interrelations and trends.
4. Hover on a car to see more info. Click on it to go to the model page, which contains detailed a description, high-quality photos, video reviews, safety ratings and Disqus widget to share your impression with other EV Compare users.

&#x200B;

**Interesting observations  at a glance**

 1. Range and battery pack capacity are closely related (what a surprise). But look how far the Tesla Roadster concept has gone!

2. There is only a slight correlation between range and MSRP. So the higher price does not necessarily mean greater range. What’s more, there is a noticeable gap in the middle, which signifies a lack of mid-range EVs.

post,awnza4,,Fatal Tesla Model 3 Crash in Florida Prompts Investigations by Federal Agencies," ""A preliminary police report from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office obtained by [Electrek](https://electrek.co/2019/03/01/tesla-driver-crash-truck-trailer-autopilot/)  said the collision occurred at an intersection off Florida State Road 7  near Pero Family Farms. The 2018 Tesla Model 3 was reportedly headed  southbound at the time that a tractor-trailer, pulling out of a driveway  leading to Pero Family Farms after stopping at a stop sign, attempted  to turn left onto the highway headed northbound. 

At that time the tractor-trailer entered the path of the Tesla, and  the latter hit the driver’s side of the trailer, “resulting in the roof  being sheared off as it passed underneath the trailer,” the report said.  The 50-year-old Tesla driver died on the scene, per Reuters. It is not  clear whether the Tesla’s Autopilot mode was active at the time of the  collision.

Per the police report, the Tesla Model 3 continued for  nearly a third of a mile before coming to a complete stop.

Chinese cars will make a huge splash in the US market. It is about to happen. True free trade with China is coming, and that means Chinese cars. Lots of them.  Expect a half dozen brands by the end of the decade. Some luxury cars and some ecoboxes.  Some of what I've seen actually looks nice. Xin Jinping isn't going to let crap cars come here though.

post,ayqhd1,,Discrimination against Tesla Owners at KC Auto Show!,"Wednesday a group of automotive enthusiasts (myself included) brought random cars that we own to Bartle Hall in Kansas City to put on display at the annual Kansas City Auto Show (think LA or Detroit Auto Show but smaller, although Bartle Hall is huge). Since the auto show doesn't fill the entire hall the group that runs the auto show (Automobile Dealer Association of Kansas City) granted the south end of the exhibit hall to the Kansas City Auto Museum to bring in cars of interest to attendees. The museum reached out to the local auto enthusiast community and were able to get volunteers like myself willing to bring our cars and leave them from 3/6-3/10 for the show.  The cars would hopefully attract people at the show to the KC Auto Museum booth and in turn the museum itself.

Unfortunately two individuals brought Teslas, one Model S and one Model X and about an hour after bringing them, parking them and getting them display ready someone from the ADAKC came by and said that because Tesla isn't a member of the ADAKC (basically meaning Tesla has no dealerships so therefore we don’t like Tesla) that the two Teslas on display would have to leave, they were not welcome at the show. The owners subsequently had to remove the cars that they are enthusiastic about. There were other cars on display whose manufacturers are also not part of the ADAKC, for example Noble, Pontiac, Ariel and Lamborghini to name a few, but those cars were not asked to leave. Since Tesla was being singled out I authored the following email to the two directors of the association: (I’m hoping Reddit can draw attention to this matter)

comment,ayqhd1,ayqhd1,,"Perhaps you didn't read my letter or the details then.  First, the KC Auto Museum has no affiliation with ADAKC.  ADAKC runs the show, they sell spots in the show primarily to their members, the various car dealers in KC.   So when you go to the show you see the Chevy display, the Ford display, the Toyota display, etc.  If you want to pony up the $$ then even a small independent auto manufacturer (think kit cars, tri-wheel things, etc.) can have a ""booth"" or display area at the event and showcase their cars.  The KC Auto Museum is an independent entity, not a car maker, as such they were able to get some floor space to display cars either from the museum or from the museum's members (local auto enthusiasts like myself) as a way of drawing attention to the museum at the car show and hopefully getting new members or visitors to the museum.   As part of the approximately 30 cars that showed up from members, 2 of them were Teslas.   After being parked for an hour or so they were asked to leave and the reason given was that Tesla the car company isn't a member of ADAKC.     The cars being displayed were NOT being displayed by Tesla, they were being displayed by OWNERS in support of the Museum's group of cars.

post,b1g3lv,,Hyundai Kona vs Tesla Model Y,"Here is the information on the Model Y lineup:

[https://i.redd.it/dm2xei0ch7m21.png](https://i.redd.it/dm2xei0ch7m21.png)

How does that objectively compare to the Hyundai Kona?

**Kona Pros:**

* The Model Y will have 230 miles of range, while the Kona has 258
* Comparing base model prices, the Kona is about $2,000 cheaper
* The base Kona is becoming available now, while the base Model Y won't be for another 2 years

**Neutral Points:**

* The Model Y has longer ranged & faster options, but at significant additional costs

**Model Y Pros:**

* Access to the Tesla Supercharging Network
* Slightly faster acceleration with the base model
* The Kona has very limited availability, even if it is considered a 2019 model year vehicle

You could even compare the Chevy Bolt to the Model Y, where the Bolt was providing a bit more range for less price in a crossover style years ago. I know there are more factors -- and I'm curious to here what you consider important -- but I'm rather unimpressed with the Model Y reveal. Competition will be heating up with VW & Chevy putting more resources into electric vehicles, in addition to Electrify America programs (which is all a good thing) -- makes me wonder how ""on top"" Tesla will continue to be (investors also seem to be worrying the same, taking a look at the stock after the reveal).

**Don't get me wrong.

comment,b1g3lv,b1g3lv,,"> Access to the Tesla Supercharging Network

I'll add that I think this is understating the case. The SC *network* is an advantage that is dwindling; admittedly slowly in the US, but it's dwindling.

The big advantage from my perspective in terms of charging is just raw charge speed. Even if you put the Kona on a high-powered CCS charger from Electrify America or whoever, it caps at 70 kW or 80 kW or whatever it is. The Model Y will be able to double that even on *today's* chargers, and SC v3 will widen the gap even more.

Edit: Automod said to include some information, not sure if I need to include a synopsis, but basically the article is going into detail about what the headline makes pretty clear. After the store closings, non store closings, layoffs, and recent bond payments, this looks like another piece of evidence for Tesla running out of cash.

Kind of a shame too, I love Elon Musk as a visionary and I think his companies are overall doing good things for the human race and the planet. Unfortunately, that alone doesn't pay your creditors. I wish they would have taken things slower and kept their focus on the luxury market until they were really ready to attack the mass market, or maybe do some kind of incremental or regional releases until they can scale properly.

Edit 2: A family member is a contractor for Tesla and hasn't received this email so it must be strictly to payroll employees. Waiting to hear back from him to see if ""volunteer"" means you still get paid normal wages but move over to deliveries temporarily, or if it means work for free.

_________________________
Edit 3: Since people can't get past this argument on what ""volunteer"" means and Tesla has not made it clear yet, I suggest you all look to the past implementation of this (since many of you are also claiming this has been done before and so it's okay). An article from [March 2018](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/elon-musk-wants-volunteer-employees-to-help-prove-teslas-haters-wrong) explains how the ""volunteering"" was carried out:

post,b2od88,,PHEV Buy or Wait Advice,"I realize this is probably overdone, but hoping to get some advice for my specific situation from the experts and enthusiasts here.

Here's my situation:  I live in an area with abysmal EV charging options. There is exactly one public, non-Tesla charger in our city of 80,000 (three more at a few hotels) and it's reportedly broken the majority of the time. Likewise, the dealerships here rarely sell (or service, which is important) PHEV/EV options and when they do, they have no clue how they work. I commute \~21 miles round trip 5 days a week to work. I own my home, can install a 240V Level 2 charger without an issue. About once every two months, I'm driving about \~300 miles round trip to one of two major metro areas nearby (Houston and New Orleans). Both seem to have some charging infrastructure, but I'm not sure if I can get over my anxiety about having to plan trips around where I'm going to park or how to get my car charged when I valet parked it downtown. My wife's anxiety about this is about 100x worse than mine. We also have kids, but we take our van everywhere for them. I'm committed to getting either a PHEV or EV as my next vehicle. I'm aiming around the $15k-25k mark for something lightly used. My current daily driver is a 2011 Sonata with 110,000 miles. My tax liability last year was very low, not enough to make the tax incentive attractive.

There's a good deal on a 2017 Chevy Volt Premier (no ACC) with low mileage at a local dealership that I'm eyeballing for $20k. I wish the legroom in the back and the trunk space was larger, but it would work. I'm overwhelmed with all the other PHEV options out there though and still considering going all-in with an EV.

Thoughts? Should I just wait it out another 1-2 years and let the used market get a bit more flushed with options?

I've been very clear in previous comments that I don't see them surviving unless they restructure and move Elon out of the CEO role, but I still think that we're all better off for Elon having started Tesla. If nothing else, I think he had a lot to do with the new surge in electric vehicles coming out that are actually competitive with gas cars. 

IMO you have to separate how you feel about Tesla as an investor and how you feel about it as a human being. For me, the two sides are polar opposites, and I imagine that's the case for atleast some of you.

* Approximately 2% of our vehicle deliveries were subject to lease accounting.
* Model S and Model X gross margin declined in Q1 predominantly due to reduced volume and pricing actions.
* Energy generation and storage revenue in Q1 decreased by 13% over Q4 2018.
* GAAP gross margin of the Energy generation and storage business in Q1 dropped to 2.4% compared to Q4 primarily due to reduced volume in the solar retrofit business.

* Interest and Other expenses were $123 million in Q1 compared to $182 million in Q4.

post,bjphfc,,I test drove A Tesla Model 3 Standard Range here is my Review.,"**Experience**: Everyone at the Jacksonville Tesla Showroom were very friendly and they appreciated that I showed up to the test drive early. They answered any questions I had with no delays. The test drive went smoother than expected Friberiro (employee at Showroom) helped make this a test drive to remember.


**Previous car**: 2013 BMW 328i ZF 8-speed ( I really don’t miss this car)


**Current car**: Honda Civic EX-T’16 CVT



*Note*: This is my opinion based on one test drive. If I said the wrong information for the touch screen or anything else please correct me.



*Duration of test drive*: 1:05 pm to 1:45 pm 40 minutes 



*Type of driving*: Mixed driving intercity traffic, interstate driving and the suburb's 



**Cons**



**The doors closing**- When you close them it makes a loud clank sound. The showroom Model 3 actually made a louder sound than the test car I drove. The sound makes it seem like the doors are going to break every time you close them. 



**The ride quality**- I expected the quality to be slightly better. ( it may have to do with the tester riding on 19 in chrome wheels). Did not ride over bumps as well as expected. I felt light thuds when riding over bumps or road inconsistencies sometimes.

post,bkho9j,,Tesla Model 3 AWD vs. C7 Corvette Grand Sport,"I’ve been daily driving Corvettes for the past (7) years or so. I had 5 years in an old C5 Corvette and spent the last two years in a C7 Grand Sport. While I *love* Corvettes my life has slowly become more complicated to the point where daily driving a C7 Grand Sport has been less and less of a joy.

Now don’t get me wrong, Corvettes are the most daily-able sports cars you can get. Plenty of trunk room, an honest 30mpg if you drive them calmly, the cars are reliable, and they are generally affordable to repair/maintain. For me though, I just recently got married, moved to a place that made for a commute that was a bit more tedious than it was fun, and in general was beginning to feel a bit limited/stressed out when driving my Corvette (more on that later). So I decided to trade in my C7 Grand Sport for a Tesla Model 3 non-performance AWD. Here are my thoughts!

**Buying Experience**:

Buying a Tesla is a generally seamless and enjoyable experience, but there are some points that are a bit unnerving.

Test driving a Tesla is literally as easy as walking into your nearest store and saying“Hi I want to test drive this model”, and 5 minutes later you’re behind the wheel of whatever models they have available. The sales staff is generally pretty friendly, helpful, and polite, and there is very minimal if any sales pressure.

Compared to your typical dealership experience, where you often have to deal with a salesman sizing you up, etc. This is a much better way to test-drive a vehicle. For instance if you want to drive a 100K+ Model S P100D the answer is “Absolutely, let me grab your co-pilot and do you want any water while we wait?” as opposed to “well let’s see if you can afford it first”

The actual ordering experience is a bit odd/sketchy at times. You have to order your car online and when ordering you place a $2500 deposit to reserve your chosen configuration.",35505,True,1556945601.0,2019-05-04 06:53:21,218,149,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/bkho9j/tesla_model_3_awd_vs_c7_corvette_grand_sport/,True,0.85,2019,both,search,False,False,0,

I’ve been putting off investing in Tesla for a while. I’ve pondered at throwing money in when it fell under 300 but after watching this interview I’ve become a believer. 
I’ll buy Tesla shares Monday Morning.
*MY THOUGHTS*
 I can see the massive amount of money being spent on long term infrastructure and when you think about it, who else has a network of superchargers like Tesla’s ? There’s a possibility competitors will need to use Tesla’s supercharges and they’ll have to reach an agreement with them. Demand for the Model 3 is massive, their problem is not being able to pump them out in time, which yes is a problem but it’s better than having them all finished and no one buying ?

I think right now it's in purgatory as people don't really know the long term direction of the business. Will it remain an auto manufacturer with side 'gigs' in energy and storage? Or, will it become a leader in autonomy technology who just happens to also manufacture the vehicles? Or, will its bread and butter be a revolution in how we gather, store and use energy for our homes? Will it be none of the above? Will it be all 3?

People just don't really feel comfortable valuing it at any of the above. It's valued sort of as a combo of all 3 parts of the business. Not quite a leading tech company but not quite an auto manufacturer.

""**Motor Mouth: These days, Tesla’s biggest problem is its fan club**

**The real impediment to growing sales of electric vehicles is the intransigence of the clientele**

by [DAVID BOOTH ](https://driving.ca/author/motocanada) | 15 HOURS AGO

It’s time to finally acknowledge as fact what many of us have long suspected — Tesla groupies are perhaps the kookiest cult this side of the Jim Jones fan club.

Now, blind loyalty in the face of facts does have its benefits. After all, it just got a U.S. president elected. Indeed, burying your head in the sand is the most common of human reactions to adversity; just ask any man confronted — stand up and take a bow, *former* president Bill Clinton — with seemingly irrefutable evidence of infidelity. But the last few days have seen the Teslarati raise the stakes in aberrance. Indeed, considering Elon Musk’s latest prognostications, the reaction of the faithful is akin to Reverend Jim, suddenly beset by something approaching a conscience, tossing away his pitcher of Kool-Aid only to have his devotees cook up another batch themselves.

This latest divorce from reality started about a month ago when Lord Elon, not content with his latest exaggerations of electric car dominance and space-time travel, upped the ante with predictions that Tesla would have “a million cars with full self-driving” capabilities on the road by next year and that, in two years, “we’ll make a car with no steering wheel or pedals.”

Now, never mind that deadly crashes directly attributable with the company’s Autopilot system are at least partly responsible for the recent chilling in autonomous automobile development, devotees cheered the news as yet more tablets from the mount. ARK analyst James Wang said Musk’s decision to bring autonomous chip design in-house would put Tesla four years ahead of its competition.",5891,True,1558505332.0,2019-05-22 08:08:52,0,17,skidz007,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/brl50l/wow_just_wow_who_is_this_david_booth_anyways/,True,0.47,2019,both,search,False,False,0,

Is Elon prone to ignoring conventional wisdom and making overly optimistic projections? Of course. We all know this. But he’s done more to advance the space than anyone ever imagined possible.

Is Tesla in financial dire straits? Yes, they absolutely have a mountain to climb. But Eon has been here before with PayPal, SpaceX and Tesla and pulled the rabbit out of the hat when the chips were down. He does need a COO.

I know we get the reputation as a cult, as fanbois, and Elon sycophants, but by and large I think most of the Teslarati have our eyes open to the actual issues yet to be overcome, and make a deliberate choice to be part of the early adopters who inevitably take the brunt of teething pains of anything new and transformative.

To: Everybody

As of yesterday, we had over 50,000 net new orders for this quarter. Based on current trends, we have a good chance of exceeding the record 90,700 deliveries of Q4 last year and making this the highest deliveries/sales quarter in Tesla history!

In order to achieve this, we need sustained output of 1,000 Model 3’s per day. Almost all parts of the Model 3 production system have exceeded 1000 units on multiple days (congratulations!!) and we’ve averaged about 900/day this week, so we’re only about 10% away from 7000/week.

Alright, I'll ask my usual question: why should I value Tesla higher (relative to fundamentals) than a comparable like Daimler?  Daimler has a market cap of about $60 billion right now.  They're a major player in the auto industry, semi trucks, heavy-duty vehicles like dump trucks and logging trucks, cargo vans, city buses and school buses, and box trucks.  They have a variety of electric models in the pipeline for when EVs become a profitable venture.  They've been testing electric semi trucks and box trucks for a while now, and have a pilot program with customers.  They've been doing cross-country autonomous drives with production-based hardware for 5+ years, and have started cross-country test hauls with autonomous semis.  Basically, they're what Tesla *wants* to become over the next 5-10 years or so.

$167 billion in revenue last year, and healthy margins for the industry despite it being a ""down"" year for Daimler.  Yet they're trading at 5.5x EBIT, or 0.30x sales.

post,btqr3j,,Tesla has a mysterious new ‘surprise’ announcement coming in China this week!," 

Link to article:

[https://electrek.co/2019/05/27/tesla-mysterious-surprise-announcement-china/](https://electrek.co/2019/05/27/tesla-mysterious-surprise-announcement-china/) 

&#x200B;

There are many speculations what this could be, and I find it interesting that they aren't announcing it through Twitter, [tesla.com](https://tesla.com) or any other mainstream way. To me, this looks like an ""under the radar"" announcement. Could ofc. be hyped up more until Friday.

The China factory is expected to be completed soon, and there are rumors that they are starting to hire for Shanghai Giga. Last time they made a ""surprise announcement"" like this, the stock had some bullish days before it took a drop after the announcement of model Y.

This announcement seems to be China only, and even if you look at the teaser picture, it looks a lot like a vehicle (in my view). To announce the whole factory like this is also a little weird.  Is this a new model, or eventually an own version of model 3 for the Chinese market? Tesla Roadster or more info on model Y?

The pick-up truck seems unlikely since it should be aimed at the US market. Tesla semi I still possible, and we haven't heard too much of it.

The Chinese text on the picture apparently states "" preparing for quick release of accumulated power "". Sounds a like it could be about super-chargers, but the picture doesn't make too much sense in that regard. 

What do you read out of it? is this a desperate attempt to boost the share price, or could this announcement be of real substantial value?",1559,False,1558987966.0,2019-05-27 22:12:46,3,9,NovaStockInvestments,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/btqr3j/tesla_has_a_mysterious_new_surprise_announcement/,True,0.62,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

For everyone else

**TL;DR**\- Discovered my love for cars. Got myself a 2018 Honda Civic Type R. Traded it in for a Lexus IS-F half a year later thinking I made an upgrade. Realized after months that I made a huge mistake. Have a Hyundai i30 Fastback N now and like the car but don't really love it. Heart still beats for that Type R that I foolishly gave up but getting one in the near future would be another irrational decision.

&#x200B;

So I used to own a Toyota Yaris Hybrid and it was a good, reliable and cost efficient car and I paid it off completely in the end. For other people that would have been the end already but of course it wasn't very exciting to drive and I discovered the car enthusiast in myself so I traded it in for a brand new 2018 Honda Civic Type R and financed the rest. I was a JDM fan since I was a kid so getting one of those shouldn't be that surprising. I don't think I have to talk to much about the car because what basically every review or person who has driven it has said is true. It's just a marvel and I never had such a good time as when I owned that car. All kinds of strangers would check out the car or would walk up to me and ask me about it and would even talk about their own cars. Fellow car enthusiasts who you wouldn't even recognize as such and would never come it contact with otherwise. Truly a great time.

&#x200B;

Then the Lexus IS-F happened. I saw one at a dealer near me for roughly the same price as I paid for the Type R. Just with the difference that the Type R was new while the IS-F was a 8 year old used one that was well taken care of though. On paper it was an upgrade in so many ways and after the test drive that I did out of curiosity I was basically intoxicated so I traded my 6 months old Type R against that car.",6314,True,1559944853.0,2019-06-08 00:00:53,4,6,the-real-Galerion,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/by0g2p/need_some_advice_from_fellow_car_enthusiast_when/,True,0.83,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

They can always pay to unlock those upgrades again, since both variants come with the same components anyway. Whether customers got hooked on those extra features enough to pay for them, however, remains to be seen.

this is the same exact situation as, say, setting up an account with a VPN service and they provide you with the ultra-fast, super-fancy Pro account for a week for free, and then after that week is up they 'downgrade' you to the account you actually signed up for, with the reminder that you can get all those nice features if you just cough up some more cash.

I happen to run [Driving-Tests.org](https://Driving-Tests.org), a driving practice test website for US learner drivers, and we get over a hundred thousand learner drivers every day using the site to prepare for their DMV exam. Elon mentioned a myth-busting one-pager they might put together - how about we all crowd-source some sort of a ""public awareness"" myth-busting quiz that I would put up for our visitors to see and take? I know it's not related to driver's exam in any way, but it has a lot to do with educating future drivers. So having something for them to take should have some long-term effect.

post,c06af6,,A year of owning a Model S and why I'm ditching it for a Model 3 now.,"Bought a 100D Model S last June after a long time waiting for a good performing electric car to come out and compete, eventually deciding that real competition was still too far away for me to wait.  I am absolutely not a member of the Cult of Elon and quite frankly think he's a little unhinged.  That said, I do like the cars and what they offer, even with their issues.  I weighed the options of getting a 100D or a long-range Model 3 at the time, but ultimately landed on the S because the wait for a 3 a year ago was still a big unknown to me, and they were still fairly new and untested, versus the ""more mature"" Model S.

I scored what seemed like a decent deal on an end of quarter inventory S at the time, so I was pretty happy to start with.  Looking back, I wish I had done a little more research and put more thought into it before going with inventory vs newly built.

Issue #1 was that instead of a 2018 model, this was a late 2017 build (November specifically).  So that probably hurt its overall value a fair amount, but the discount was deep enough I figured to make it worth it.  I was well aware of all of this.  Issue #2 that I wasn't really aware of was that this late 2017 build car meant that it was still an ""MCU1"" car, meaning it was built with the older, inferior computer driving the infotainment, nav, etc.  The autopilot hardware was current for the time though (AP 2.5).  The older MCU wasn't really a noticeable issue for the first 4 or 5 months with the car, until it got the big version 9 update that came with a reworked UI to more closely match the Model 3's UI.  After that, performance issues have been a way of life.

Service Summary: they replaced the charge port carrier assembly, seat belt buckle, high voltage controller, 12v battery, and the TESLA battery.

Before leaving I asked a couple questions:

\- Immersive sound: I originally ""complained"" saying the rear deck, A pillar speakers, and side mirror speakers do not output any sound with or without immersive sound and that immersive sound did nothing. (I know SR+ doesn't have the extra speakers, just wanted to see what they said). Technician said they tested everything and their pc showed ""all green"". He personally said none of the techs could hear the difference with immersive sound on or off and that's just how it is. He mentioned it could be for future audiophiles who want to upgrade/add sub+amp from TSLA which kind of made sense. Kind of prepares you for it...??

\- FSD Refund: I am one of the people who bought FSD before the 'supposed' price hike on May 1. Purchased on May 1 in the morning. Later found out it's 6k flat before or after delivery. I complained to the SC that I deserve a refund due to the fact that my car has been with them for over 2 months and I was not able to experience FSD due to delay after delay. After I picked up my car today, the manager called me saying they'll be issuing me a check for partial refund on FSD (\~$1500; $7k+fees - $6k)

post,c0oc9o,,How owning a Tеsla changed my life <in a energy/soul crushing daily commute>,"This story was posted by the user xtheory on a certain other sub, but I thought a few of you may find it interesting if your commute is as stressful as this guy.

I guess it's more a praise of AutoPilot rather than Tesla per se, so it's very possible other cars with advanced self-driving (either existing or in future) will have the same benefits.

-----------------

Many of us here talk about the features of our cars, the newest firmware update, the little problems (and sometimes big), and nuances of owning and driving a Tesla. But I want to shift the conversation for just a moment and speak to how owning a Tesla has impacted my life as a whole. I emphatically encourage anyone else here to share your story, good or bad, as well. So here goes...

I commute about 3 hours a day in heavy LA traffic. Next to NYC, it's probably the most grueling nightmare of lane changes, starting and stopping, praying to the Gods of Sidestreets that you can make it home with a fraction of your sanity still intact in the US. The HOV lanes are a small reprieve at times, but often just as congested as the regular ones. On any given day, most of us that live here probably in jest wish for a quick death to end it all just so we don't have to sit in another hour of traffic; yet somehow we prevail to drive another day. We drove our dumb cars, in dumb traffic, with dumb people, and even dumber gas prices. This was our plight, and yet we were resigned to it, even though with every breathe we said ""Dear Lord, why me? What did I do to deserve this?"" We returned home fatigued, haggard, with barely enough energy to cook a good meal for ourselves or our families. We fell asleep during movie night with our significant others because the road took what life we had left in us at the end of a long work day.

Then Tesla came around and offered me an alternative.

post,c2wc90,,"There aren't a lot of Model 3 reviews from ""traditional"" car enthusiasts, so I wrote my own","While I know the Model 3 has been out for 2 years now, it seems a lot of reviews are from Tesla fans and not so much “traditional” car enthusiasts, so I thought I’d write a review voicing my opinions. That, plus I want my thoughts recorded for my own posterity.

For some time now, I’ve been considering purchasing a Tesla Model 3. I’m generally a more frugal car enthusiast, and spending $39.9k on any other car would be nuts to me, but the Tesla at least on paper offers a lot to like: there’s of course the instant acceleration at any speed, but there’s also the super low CoG, lack of distractions in the cabin (so you can focus on driving!), no warm-up and cool-down procedures, OTA updates that occasionally bring performance and range increases, and no guilt associated with lots of unnecessary driving, which I personally do value. I was also very tempted by Autopilot, since there are times I just don’t care to drive and would be perfectly happy to let the car do the work.

So, to assuage my curiosity, I rented a long-range RWD model for two days from Turo. I spent a couple minutes adjusting settings, drove off, and… instantly hated it. Right off the bat:

* I could not for the life of me get the seat into a comfortable position. The seat bottom was bolstered too much and cut into my thigh, the pressure on my back was awful no matter where I put the lumbar support, and the headrest intrudes forwards and *doesn’t adjust at all* so when sitting upright, your head actually touches the seat before your shoulders do. Try to put your shoulders against the seat too, and you end up sitting like a hunchback. I absolutely *hated* this, and despite frequently adjusting the seat throughout the two days, I couldn’t make it any better.

* The driver’s mirror doesn’t adjust far enough out. I like to follow the recommended method for [eliminating blind spots]( https://www.caranddriver.",16602,True,1561039086.0,2019-06-20 15:58:06,2941,654,hutacars,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/c2wc90/there_arent_a_lot_of_model_3_reviews_from/,True,0.91,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,
comment,c2wc90,c2wc90,,"I drove my friend's Model 3 over a weekend and I had similar thoughts about the car. One thing I disagree with you on is the seat, I'm 6'0"" tall and had no issue with getting the seat to adjust to my liking. I'm not sure what is up with the one you rented but I had no problems with the headrest and my shoulders and all that.

I also found the same problems you found with AutoPilot. It makes some *strange* decisions at times when traveling at speed in moderate traffic. It tends to work best with either a lot of slow traffic or no traffic, moderate traffic gives it the most problems. My friend says that during his morning commute he barely pays attention anymore, the car does all the work for him, since it's mostly bumper to bumper up the highway to his office.

As far as connecting with the car goes, it definitely feels like you're driving an Apple Car. The way everything is designed reminds me of my company iPhone. It's sleek and nice looking but when you need to do something nitty gritty it's a pain in the ass and often locked away from you without hacking the software. The Tesla UI feels very similar to that. I still found myself being able to enjoy driving the car, as it is RWD with Instant Torque and I didn't find the steering to be as vague as you did. I thought the steering was precise enough to enjoy the car when you were on a windy road.

Also you can turn off the traction control in the same menu as the Chill mode setting.",1649,True,1561044844.0,2019-06-20 17:34:04,334,0,Michelanvalo,cars,https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/c2wc90/there_arent_a_lot_of_model_3_reviews_from/ern55b8/,True,,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,ern55b8

comment,ca9soj,ca9soj,,">Toyota does not have an all-electric car yet but is presently explore solar roofs on its Prius hybrid,

A hybrid car like a Prius is as much an electric car as a Mustang is a hybrid because it has a 12V battery and a motor to start the engine.

>. The firm was previously concentrated on hybrids as a way to take advantage of its limited battery production ability as well as place even more vehicles on the road

That's a very positive outlook on life. Another would be to say they can't compete with electric cars so they put more ICE cars on the road, like 10 million units a year and they throw some batteries at a couple of them, like a small percentage that doesn't even matter.

>The firm lately started openly testing a brand-new version of its solar roofing for the Prius PHV, which can add to 44.5 kilometres (27.6 miles) of range a day, or even as much as 56.3 kilometres (35 miles) when using the auxiliary power that likewise drives Air Conditioning, navigation, and various other systems.

Is that EPA range or internal testing? Because of the size, weight and aerodynamics of the car, it's difficult to imagine it would be anything outside of careful, slow driving.

post,catv1e,,Interest in using EV as a home battery backup?,"Hello all!

&#x200B;

Knowing that there would be some engineering hurdles to tackle (inverter, switches, home wiring, software, etc), how much interest is there for using an EV as a battery backup? 

&#x200B;

Some back of the napkin math using calculations from Tesla's powerwall site shows its cars could theoretically support usage of a small home for almost 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

||  Capacity (kWh)|  Duration (days)|
|:-|:-|:-|
| Powerwall |13.5|1.72|
|Model 3|75|9.56|
|Model S|100|12.74|
|Model X|100|12.74|

&#x200B;

Is this something owners would be interested in as a power outage backup option? It seems like it could be a fantastic value add if the additional costs were low enough.",694,False,1562634727.0,2019-07-09 03:12:07,2,4,Careful_Wallaby,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/catv1e/interest_in_using_ev_as_a_home_battery_backup/,True,0.75,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,
comment,catv1e,catv1e,,"Long term, I am very interested in this possibility.

I'm actually somewhat excited by V2G in general. One of the reasons that it's very difficult to make a BEV make sense for me is that I live very close to work and often don't even drive in (I'd guess long-term average is about half the time, though it tends to be bursty); e.g. my car stayed in my garage all of yesterday. If I could get paid to use that battery capacity via a V2G system, that would be *great* and mean that my car could actually be doing something. In theory, this could be an alternative way to make income from the car rather than send it out as autonomous taxi (something I think I'd be hesitant to do). The big question is how much would that pay. I've done some calculations on arbitraging TOU rates between charging at night then backfeeding the grid at day, but I think it's really unlikely to make financial sense due to the extra battery wear. So the utility would have to pay higher-than-normal peak rates. Still, could be an interesting idea as some kind of supplement to peaking plants or something from the utility's perspective to occasionally pay that.

> ...its cars could theoretically support usage of a small home for almost 2 weeks.

Hmm, methinks Tesla is being a ""bit"" optimistic if it's saying that a 13.5 kWh powerwall will last 1.72 days.

I only am offering him $100, because he didn't do shit with the business while I was putting in most of the work. Now he wants to pay me $100 to give up my equity so he can take full ownership. I stated no, because I would want my full investment back as well. We both own 50/50 and it's a 2 member managed LLC in Florida. He lives in Rhode Island,  but I live in Florida and I take care of most of the business operations.

post,cowzl5,,Lithium market flood and Panasonic stocks & strategy,"TLDR: Do you consider Panasonic a good stock to buy?

I am setting up my portfolio and am looking into the exposure to the Electric Vehicle, Battery and Energy markets. I was looking into some stocks and put these pieces together. Please tell me if it sounds farfetched.

My rationale: Panasonic produces batteries in partnership with Tesla, signed an agreement with Toyota to produce EV batteries starting 2020 and the stock is down to 2016 levels. Lithium is predicted to flood the Market coming from China, Australia and Latin America, cutting the price of the raw material considerably (\~50%). Panasonic - being a major consumer of Lithium for its production - expects a major increase in output (Toyota partnership and Teslas' Gigafactory expansion) and a drop in raw material cost. Also, Panasonic produces competitively-priced solar panels, which may see an increase in demand due to the energy requirements of EVs (shifting from gas to electricity) which shows no sign of slowing down.

So, I am inclined to buying some Panasonic stocks while still expecting some initial downturn (as to not try and time the market).

comment,cowzl5,cowzl5,,""" Do you consider Panasonic a good stock to buy?""

No. The stock is half of where it was in 1994 and has largely gone nowhere in the last 25 years. If the company has not been the leader in well, just about anything for the last 25 years, what gives you the confidence that they will here? 

""Also, Panasonic produces competitively-priced solar panels""

Which is not a good business - solar has been just about the worst sector for the last decade. The automobile business is not particularly good one, either. 

""Panasonic produces batteries in partnership with Tesla,""

And there's been considerable discussion about the strained relationship between Panasonic and Tesla over the last year or so.

comment,cowzl5,cowzl5,,"""""(Solar) is not a good business..."" - What do you think the reasons are for that?""

Commoditized business with little barrier to entry. I've said for 2-3 years now, the place to be is in green-centric utilities like NEE or warehouse REIT PLD (and their business is certainly not heavily focused on solar, but they are generating a ton of energy from panels on all their buildings around the world that they are buying from whatever company can probably deliver them the cheapest.)

""""If the company has not been the leader..."" - Is leadership in a market relevant if the main prospect is the valuation of the stock?""

Panasonic's stock is half of what it was in 1994 and has largely wandered for over two decades.  I like companies that have delivered for shareholders. Panasonic has not delivered for shareholders. Panasonic stock has a negative trailing total return % on Morningstar YTD and for the  1/3/5/10/15 year periods.

The company had largely been focused for many years on consumer electronics - the TV business is a terrible business, the digital camera business has shrunk considerably (see Canon's quarter recently) and there was little barrier to entry to a lot of the other things that Panasonic was involved in.

5 years or so ago they started to move into new lines of business and move the focus away from consumer electronics and....the stock still hasn't done well.",3831,True,1565547674.0,2019-08-11 20:21:14,5,0,dvdmovie1,investing,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cowzl5/lithium_market_flood_and_panasonic_stocks_strategy/ewmbigv/,True,,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,ewmbigv

""They say Hollywood is to blame.

They say producers played it “fast and loose” with the technical details.

But even if that were the case, it doesn’t change the fact that the 1986 Chernobyl disaster was caused by human error that resulted in nearly 20,000 cases of confirmed thyroid cancer with no real accurate tally of deaths connected to the accident.

To put that in perspective, that’s more than twice the population of Park City, Utah.

Lackluster safety protocols and flawed reactor designs, which were not uncommon under communist practices that oftentimes didn’t include accuracy and precision, led to this disaster. And while I maintain that it is not the splitting of isotopes that’s the problem, but rather the inability of humans to responsibly operate nuclear power plants in an economically feasible manner, nuclear power has been a very effective form of baseload power for decades. But at least in the U.S., those days are coming to an end.

The bottom line is that nuclear power is simply not economically sustainable.

This, dear reader, is why Exelon recently announced that it would be retiring the Three Mile Island nuclear power facility 15 years early.

It has nothing to do with Hollywood, and it has nothing to do with the Three Mile Island emergency that scared the crap out of us all back in 1979.

Plain and simple...
It’s All About the Money

There is one main reason nuclear power no longer has a future in the U.S.

And I’ll tell you about it in just a moment.

But first, let’s dispel this myth that nuclear power is cheap, as it’s never been able to survive without massive subsidies.

As reported by UCS, the nuclear industry is only able to portray itself as a low-cost power supplier today because of past government subsidies and write-offs.",6222,True,1567053906.0,2019-08-29 06:45:06,0,6,dongasaurus_prime,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cww5d2/why_investors_should_forget_about_nuclear_power/,True,0.21,2019,elon,search,False,False,0,

post,czve4f,,Suggestion: Indicate inability to communicate with sensors as part of the self-test when shifting out of park,"I took delivery of my Model 3 SR+ a week ago and about 2 days in noticed a lack of external temperature and some other issues. Posting here and searching the web indicated it was likely the front bumper was unplugged. Took the car in today and this was indeed the issue and thankfully a quick fix. 

What confuses me is why the car passes the ‘startup’ self-check (safety lights appear then disappear when built in checks pass) if it can’t communicate with several sensors. It would be useful to know if something happens to those sensors or the connection without having to guess based on what features work or don’t. In my case (and many others recently based on TMC forums) this would have saved a lot of time for Tesla Inc and buyers spent diagnosing, coming in for service, etc. for something forgotten during manufacturing. Lean engineering, fast feedback, etc. 

Also, I can’t for the life of me find an official email, form, etc. on the Tesla site to make suggestions. Something else they could improve.

post,d48wyg,,Is Kia Telluride's driving assist system as good as Tesla's Autopilot? It's actually pretty close. Here’s an in depth review from a Tesla owner.,"DRIVING ASSIST

I recently got a chance to drive a Kia Telluride ""S"" for a day and spent a fair bit of that time testing out the driving assist system in it, which is likely to function the same in its Hyundai counterpart, the Palisade.

Coming from owning a Tesla Model S with Autopilot 2 hardware, I've been interested in the Telluride/Palisade's driving assist system since early reviews. After seeing the Straight Pipe's review of the Telluride (https://youtu.be/v8bqw7qjwus), calling it the ""best lane keep of any car they've driven this year"", I knew I had to find out if a rarely talked about feature in Kia's new flagship vehicle could really meet or beat the gold standard for driving assist; Tesla's autopilot.

The two features I'm specifically interested in are the ""Lane Following Assist (LFA)"" and the ""Smart Cruise Control w/ Stop and Go (SCC)"". The first applies to the steering by keeping you centered in the lane, the second handling the acceleration and braking. Plenty of cars I've driven have good adaptive cruise control systems, and barely noticeable lane keeping systems, but few have come close to the magic of Tesla's autopilot in keeping you a safe distance from cars and objects, and centered in the lane.

THE SYSTEM IN USE

After enabling Kia's ""Lane Following Assist"" in the driver's settings menu from the steering wheel, it will only reveal itself on the dashboard once the adaptive cruise control has been turned on and set. A little steering wheel icon will show up colored white to the right of the adaptive cruise icon in the dashboard. It seems that the ""Lane Following Assist"" will be available and activate on just about any road with good lane lines. This is one of Tesla's Autopilot's best features, as you're not limited to preordained highways like in Cadillac's Supercruise. It was available and active for me most of the time I was using the adaptive cruise control.",11328,True,1568485330.0,2019-09-14 20:22:10,71,21,humanwire,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/d48wyg/is_kia_tellurides_driving_assist_system_as_good/,True,0.83,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,
comment,d48wyg,d48wyg,,"Awesome share! I’ve been wondering this myself following their video. 

From everything you say, it sounds like the Kia system is almost as capable as the Mercedes system.

I’ve spent a lot of time with the 2019 Mercedes Drive Assist or whatever it’s called, and it’s criminally underrated. It can do everything you mentioned + slow down on curves (usually too much for my tastes but that’s a different story) + change lanes upon direction. I don’t think it’s as good as the Tesla system but it’s pretty damn good. Hands off steering wheel it’ll complain after about 45 seconds and start to shut down after around 80 seconds. 

Volvo’s Drive Pilot is pretty good but requires too much hand-on-steering wheel. I think it balks after 15 seconds. 

Subaru and Toyota are decent but too jerky. They were somewhere between Volvo and Mercedes in terms of hand on steering wheel requirement.  

Of course, the hands-off time is usually time spent in stop and go traffic when most of these systems really shine. Or also clear wide open roads like parts of the mid-west. 

In all, I’m thrilled to see the continued development on this front, and in 5-7 years, smooth controlled assisted driving will be mainstream.",1205,False,1568496176.0,2019-09-14 23:22:56,11,0,Alienblueacct,cars,https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/d48wyg/is_kia_tellurides_driving_assist_system_as_good/f098wug/,True,,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,f098wug

post,d62t6w,,Why I'm bullish on tesla off the top of my head,"I know on paper tesla looks terrifying but the vast majority of drivers drive I.C.E. cars (internal combustion engine, another word for gasoline vehicles). Currently in 2019 I think only less than 2% of cars on the road are electric, this means there is A LOT of room for growth. On top of this Tesla already produces the best of the best electric vehicles and old car manufactures are unable to compete. Tesla is decades ahead on technology compared to the rest of the world when it comes to electric vehicles. It quite funny, other car companies are releasing electric vehicles in 2019 that don't even beat Teslas very first car that came out in 2012! I'm very bullish on this case alone but tesla has so many other avenues for growth it's truly mind boggling. I'll quickly summarize the other growth factor and can go in more detail if you're interested.

1. Self driving vehicles, tesla is working on self driving vehicles which could allow them to have their own ""uber"" company in the future. Once again, tesla is wayyyyy ahead on the competition when it come to self driving. (They also plan on selling self driving semi trucks within the next few years and Elon estimates that car will be 100% self drivable in less than 5 years. (I'm really excited for this because self driving cars are a lot safer than human driven cars, and less traffic because self driving cars are also statically proven to be much more efficient!

2. Self driving cars leads me to my second point, tesla insurance. Elon has his own insurance for Teslas because Teslas are statistically way safer cars (and will become safer as self driving is implemented) I don't know much about insurance tbh but I know Warren buffet got rich off of buying an insurance company and Elon has his own the far exceeds what other companies offer (only for Teslas which is kinda creating its own ecosystem, same with their tesla ""uber"" service

Doesn't really seem like self-driving cars are going to be a thing any time soon, and the infrastructure needed to support electric cars is very far off from being available. People need to be able to find somewhere to charge their cars easily and be able to do so in a few minutes like they can with pumping gas. You're also forgetting automotive interests are fighting like hell and are far more entrenched than Tesla. They've literally been getting Tesla's business model banned in several states. As far as the barriers to entry, I don't know enough about the tech to refute your points there, but I do know the competitive landscape is filled with some of the most well resourced companies and recognizable brands in the world. They can catch up, and they can sell. Sometimes, inferior products do better because of superior brands.

As far as solar panels go, I don't know the numbers, but you can hype up the deals they make for them all you'd like, but they'd be meaningless unless they make money. I don't know that they aren't, but the points you've made about how great their solar roofs are are only as good as the numbers beneath them.

comment,d62t6w,d62t6w,,"I think you’re bullish for the wrong reasons at the wrong time.

There is really one main reason to own Tesla and that’s Elon. I mean, without looking it up, think of the name the CEO of Ford, GM or VW. Can’t think of it? I couldn’t.

What you bet on with Tesla is the next new thing. Their electric cars are the iPhones of cars, and while they’ve been stagnant for a while, there’s a greater chance for a next new development with Tesla than there is with any other car company. There’s also the possibility for an unknown factor to come into play, like when Apple opened the App Store.

I think the timing is wrong in that it’s too early. I’m near term bearish on them in part because Elon’s attention seems partly focused on SpaceX and those satellites he’s sending up. The next phase for Tesla might come from that development though. Either that or 5G connectivity for the cars, with that constant communication then the system can become greatly optimized. It might be as interesting as the developments in Detroit’s smart traffic management system rollout.

post,d7i02d,,Anyone else excited for the Model S Plaid?,"Without starting another blatant Porsche VS. Tesla pissing contest, is anyone else excited that Tesla is attempting something like the Model S Plaid? 

I'm a current Model 3 AWD owner, and before that was a C7 Grand Sport owner. I like sporty high performance vehicles but the driving characteristics and convenience of an EV are really hard to pass up. Since getting my Model 3 AWD, I've been very happy but have also been yearning for something with a bit more performance to it. 

I was cautiously optimistic about the Taycan as it seemed to offer a more sporty alternative to Tesla's EV offerings, but the super high starting price tag, lack of self driving functionality, and comparatively limited range made it less of an option for me. Especially considering that you could get a Model 3 performance and a C8 combined for less money.

Though there's a lot of debate about how legitimate the Model S Plaid's times are, I think it's really exciting to see some straight up competition like this. Likewise, even if the Model S Plaid only matches the Taycan's performance on the track it is still going to be cheaper, have better range, have autopilot, and a more established charging infrastructure to go off of. 

What's really compelling to me is that the Model S Plaid really could be the first car that could legitimately nail great track performance with unparalleled day to day convenience, and though it will still be expensive, it will be at a more obtainable price point comparatively speaking. 

I just think the fact that we're coming out with cars that look to be so capable is something to really get excited about.",1632,False,1569107199.0,2019-09-22 01:06:39,2,25,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/d7i02d/anyone_else_excited_for_the_model_s_plaid/,True,0.51,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Big allegations in the lawsuit about information being withheld from E&Y, Musk's involvement in the merger despite recusing himself.  Some of the big ones being: 

 - E&Y determined SolarCity was insolvent shortly after Tesla acquired it
 - Evercore refused to issue an opinion to Tesla on acquiring the company in the first place as their advisor on the deal
 - Lazard who was hired by SolarCity to analyze other options could not locate anyone else interested in buying the company at all.

Tesla has refuted the allegations as untrue and the case hasn't gone to trial yet for them to demonstrate otherwise at this point.

Nio has been facing a lot of trouble lately and the most recent headline is a significant drop in electrical vehicle sales in China as subsidies have been rolled back.

post,das2jn,,Tesla Model 3 AWD vs C7 Grand Sport Road Trip Review,"  

I recently took a trip from Los Angeles up to San Francisco in my Tesla Model 3 AWD. It was my first time road tripping in an electric vehicle and I did a similar trip in my old C7 Corvette Grand Sport so I figured it would be worth sharing my experiences. 

**Routes:** 

My trip in the Model 3 was straight up I-5 from Los Angeles to San Francisco. 

On the C7 I took a more scenic PCH/101 route up to San Francisco and then took the I-5 home. 

Though not exactly an apples to apples comparison on the way up, I think each route played to the car’s strengths. 

The C7 route was made more for of an enjoyable/scenic driving experience, whereas the Model 3 route was made to be very safe with Tesla supercharger infrastructure in mind. 

**Driving Experience:** 

**C7:** To be honest my road trip experience in the C7 left a little to be desired. On the way up I picked a fairly enjoyable route along the California coast with enough beautiful views to make for a memorable experience, and with enough fun road for the car to stretch its legs. Here’s what I ran into. 

**-It was a little harsh.** Though my car did have magnetic ride shocks and we traveled primarily in “tour” mode the C7 did beat me up after a little while. For reference I’m a 27 year old so it’s not like this is some old guy complaining who’s expecting Cadillac ride quality in his track-focused sports car. This also isn’t to say that the car is too stiff to be enjoyable on road trips…it’s just that the sporty setup does wear on you after a few hours. 

**-The car was a little hard to enjoy in the spirited sections of the trip.** This isn’t to say that the C7 handled bad, wasn’t fast in delivering power, etc. It’s just that the C7 Grand Sports’ limits are so high that street legal and street safe speeds don’t really excite it. So driving some of the spirited sections on this trip was a bit of let down because it felt like I was only using a fraction of the car’s potential.",15390,True,1569741944.0,2019-09-29 09:25:44,31,38,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/das2jn/tesla_model_3_awd_vs_c7_grand_sport_road_trip/,True,0.69,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Updated Oct. 23, 2019 8:07 pm ET

Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.35% posted a surprise profit for the third quarter, easing investor fears that the electric car maker’s pursuit of growth and record production figures would come at the expense of the bottom line.

The electric-car maker said Wednesday that it would continue to be profitable, but cautioned that new products could affect the company’s margins.

Tesla’s shares climbed 20% in after-hours trading.

The company said trial production of its compact Model 3 car has started at a new facility in China, and production on its new Model Y compact sport-utility vehicle is ahead of schedule, with a launch set for next summer. The China facility is another sign of Tesla’s ambition to become a global force in car production.

Tesla posted earnings of 78 cents a share for the three months ended Sept. 30, upending analysts’ predictions for a loss of 46 cents a share. For the year-earlier quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.75 a share.

A record delivery figure helped lift Tesla’s bottom line, as customers largely flocked to the lower-price Model 3.

But even as Tesla ramps up Model 3 production, sales of its premium cars have declined.

Third-quarter revenue fell to $6.3 billion from $6.82 billion a year earlier, as deliveries of the Model S and Model X vehicles dropped 37%.

Analysts polled by FactSet had predicted revenue of $6.43 billion.

The company said it is on track to deliver more than 360,000 vehicles in 2019, the lower end of its targeted range of 360,000 to 400,000.

Tesla has had back-to-back quarters of record vehicle deliveries this year after failing to meet estimates earlier in 2019. The company needs to deliver at least 104,800 vehicles in the three months through Dec. 31 to meet the lower end of the projected range.",4761,True,1571878282.0,2019-10-24 02:51:22,5,2,beck2047,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/dm8uit/tesla_delivers_a_surprising_profit/,True,0.64,2019,both,search,False,False,0,

Serious stuff is happening in Shanghai, the site of Tesla’s second manufacturing facility, company executives said on a phone call with investors. The carmaker’s “low-cost” Model 3 vehicles are already moving through assembly lines on a trial basis, and Musk heralded the “massive” stamping machines and in-operation paint shop. He also confirmed media reports that a second building is under construction in the Shanghai complex to handle battery and module production. Tesla hopes to produce 1,000 Model 3s a week from the factory by the end of the year. It will also produce Model Ys, its affordable crossover model, at the plant.

In its earning report, Tesla said it is working to finalise its local manufacturing license and to meet “other governmental requirements” before ramping up production in Shanghai.

That’s good news for Tesla, because China is vital to the carmaker’s future. Though the country’s economy has been buffeted by a trade war with the US, it still has among the most electric-vehicle-friendly regulations on the globe. Chinese car buyers shelled out for one million electric vehicles in 2018, and should buy two million next year, according to a report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

post,dqpewh,,9 Clever Solutions if the .com Domain Name of Your Brand is Taken,"After countless hours refining your brand story, brainstorming names and designing your marketing materials you have finally come up with a stellar brand name for your business. You complete all the official paperwork to register your business under this name. Finally, you go to the registrar of your choice to register the .com domain name that matches your brand name. To your shock and horror you find that it has already been registered. You are not alone, this happens to countless new businesses every day. You can’t go back in time. So what do you do?

1. Try to buy it

This one seems so obvious, however, many people just give up when they find that the domain name is registered. Type the domain name into your browser and see what it resolves to. If you get a landing page indicating that the name is for sale then contact the owner to see if you can acquire it. If the page is parked at a registrar or the domain does not resolve to a website then use [Whois](https://www.whois.com/) or [ICANN Lookup](https://lookup.icann.org/) to find out who the registrant is and contact them.

The above is actually a good situation to be in because at least it means that the domain name is available. If there is a business using the domain then it can be extremely difficult and even impossible at times to acquire it. Many business owners say “we will buy the domain later when we become a big company and can afford it”. Even if you’re a unicorn and can afford it, the business might still not want to sell it to you due to the value that it provides to them. What do you think is happening with [Cruise Automation](https://getcruise.com/) which was [acquired by General Motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_Automation) and [Cruise.com](https://www.cruise.com/). There are numerous other cases exactly like this one. Would you sell a domain name that your entire business depends on?

2. Rebrand

All your marketing materials contain this name. All your customers know you by this name.",8364,True,1572724312.0,2019-11-02 20:51:52,0,3,DotEvoke,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/dqpewh/9_clever_solutions_if_the_com_domain_name_of_your/,True,0.38,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Tesla is different, absolutely and fundamentally.

post,dxo5ww,,Racial bias in Investing? Just look at the data.,"“But I’m not a racist” 

is a constant refrain in Silicon Valley — a place where 91% of venture capitalists are men, 98% are white or Asian, and almost 90% of their funding goes to white-male led ventures.

It seems like if you buy the pint of vanilla ice cream over the chocolate pint 98 out of 100 times you walk into the grocery store, you might have some ingrained preference for vanilla, no? Maybe you think you have open taste buds, but if vanilla is on the front of the shelf, and it’s a brand you recognize, it’s just the easiest thing to pick up and move on with your day. You’re not looking to see if something else might be available, and equally or more delicious, hiding in plain sight. You’re moving on autopilot, and thus eating a lot of vanilla, whether or not it’s good for you. And that’s what’s most tragic about the status quo – it not only hurts those who aren’t getting chosen, but also the person doing the choosing. 

Venture capitalists, and the asset owners and managers who fund them, pride themselves on being open-minded when it comes to allocating capital: “I don’t care if they are black, blue or have purple spots, as long as they are great managers who can make money.” They view themselves as fully available to new flavors, spotting trends before others do in order to capture the best returns in a competitive market. 

But they are forgetting about the notion of unconscious bias, the ingrained habits we get from society that are extra difficult to root out. Like breathing while sleeping, they happen so naturally we don’t even acknowledge their existence. We only see the outcome — that we don’t die in our sleep (if we are lucky), and we wind up with portfolios of predominantly white fund managers and entrepreneurs. 

This not only means that we as capital allocators perpetuate the vast racial and socioeconomic inequality of our society, but also that we are missing out on massive sources of innovation in a majority-minority country.",13632,True,1574006060.0,2019-11-17 16:54:20,0,9,hugebiggiant,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/dxo5ww/racial_bias_in_investing_just_look_at_the_data/,True,0.1,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

de G Capital - ‎2019 As of 2019 November 19, Tuesday current price of TSLA stock is 347.390$ and our data indicates that the asset price has been in an uptrend for the past 1 year ...  Future price of the stock is predicted at 478.258$ (36.596% ) after a year according to our prediction system.

which rates on high/low/median values. The median predicts a fall, but the advice is to buy. Its as if they don't believe in their own median! Use of a median (and not a mean value) seems very strange because the various estimates tend to be grouped at the extremes, and it only takes one analyst (in the mid values), to change their mind and the whole result changes. 

As for the Google graph of this or any other stock value, it really is misleading because the day-to-day changes occur  in the context of a changing Nadaq and Dow Jones index.

When the ""unbreakable"" windows broke the whole event seemed like a complete disaster.  Someone made the joke of ""what if John Delorean designed the El Camino"" and I laughed my ass off thinking that was dead on.

But a day or so later, after watching several in-depth youtuber videos of the truck from the test rides, seeing the interior and how massive and spacious the whole thing is, seeing the 16 inch ground clearance (this thing is NO El Camino), looking at the specs, utility features and price I have completely done a 180.  I have decided it's going to be my next vehicle and almost can't wait to get one.  

I'm curious to see what your thoughts are.  What was your initial impression of the Telsa Cybertruck and has that changed as you've taken a closer look?

But I kind of suspect at least some of them are beginning to warm to it to based on discussion in Teams. One of my co-workers showed the pictures to his 7 year old, and he thinks it's really cool. That co-worker was asking if other people's kids liked the cybertruck to.

Controlling the air conditioner using touch screen is actually cumbersome, Its much easier by pressing buttons because you dont really have to take your eyes off the road. This is really important when you are driving for hours in bumper to bumper traffic in cities like Banglore, Mumbai, etc.

I prefer using my smart phone attached to a holder for GPS instead of huge center displays just because its small!

In the biggest-ever takeover in the luxury-goods industry, lvmh, a French global conglomerate, announced its acquisition of **Tiffany**, an American jeweller founded in 1837 and known for its flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York. lvmh is paying $16.9bn, more than the roughly $14.5bn that was suggested when the transaction was first mooted in late October. The deal represents a success for Bernard Arnault, lvmh’s boss and controlling shareholder, who had courted Tiffany for some time. See [article](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/11/30/lvmh-tests-the-limits-of-luxury).

## The magic trick

The flotation of **Alibaba’s** shares on the Hong Kong stockmarket raised $11.2bn, making it the most valuable share offering this year, ahead of the $8.1bn that Uber raked in at its ipo in May. The stock rose by 6.6% on the first day of trading in what is a secondary listing in Alibaba. Its shares are also listed in New York. See [article](https://www.economist.com/node/21775688).

**Uber** lost its licence to operate in London, again. The ride-hailing company has 45,000 drivers in the city, one of its biggest markets. London’s transport regulator raised more concerns about safety, including 14,000 fraudulent trips by unauthorised drivers. Uber is appealing against the decision and can continue to operate while it does so. See [article](https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/11/27/london-hits-uber-hard-and-hails-a-fleet-of-new-cheaper-apps).

The chief executive of **Westpac** resigned and the chairman said he would step down next year, as Australia’s second-largest bank faced mounting criticism about its response to a money-laundering scandal. A regulator has accused Westpac of failing to monitor more than 23m suspect transactions, some of which enabled child exploitation in the Philippines.",5411,True,1574998903.0,2019-11-29 04:41:43,1,0,aaron4400,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/e394lb/the_economist_business_this_week_113019_edition/,True,0.57,2019,both,search,False,False,0,

post,ea513r,,Twelve Days of Pre-Recession GM Christmas: Saturn's Red Line,"**What do you mean 'Pre-Recession'?**

After the year 2000, but before the economic recession of 2008, GM was making some weird cars. Retro styled cars, cars with high performance trims (for seemingly no reason), cars with LS motors mounted sideways, and of course, Saabs.

Why these cars came about is complex. If somebody is willing to offer a theory, I'm all ears. However, I'm not here to explore the roots of this issue, only what fruit it ended up bearing. While many of these cars may have continued production after the recession of 2008-2010, most if not all were born of the white heat of stupidity that lost GM $82 billion before this time. I say stupidity of course, because most of the following vehicles I would like to own one day.

**Saturn's 'Red Line'**

[Saturn](https://i.redd.it/0aqpdkbm8of11.jpg) lived fast and died young, having only made cars for twenty years. Set up to compete with the flood of small, superior Japanese cars entering the U.S. market, they made small, inferior American cars. A few of these vehicles managed to claw their way out of obscurity via forced induction, or because they made you think, ""Why?"".

""Red Line"" was like Saturn's BMW 'M'. Knowing what Saturn was, you can kind of string together what that really meant. It's like a joke where the setup and the punchline are the same.

""Saturn says they're making their own version of BMW's 'M' division. Critics say they're expecting it to be like if Saturn made their own version of BMW's 'M' division.""

The vehicles that received the Red Line trim were the Ion, Sky, and Vue. I'll start with the Ion.

The Saturn Ion ""coupe"" is a strange car to begin with, just as Saturn was a strange brand. Similar to the Mazda RX-8, it has an extra set of miniature doors to accommodate the rear passengers.

Veteran executives and financiers helped fuel WeWork’s spectacular rise and fall, pouring in capital while ceding control to its founder

By Maureen Farrell and Eliot Brown
Dec. 14, 2019 12:00 am ET
 
In early October, WeWork’s board of directors trickled into a brick building in lower Manhattan where the startup had an office. After they took their seats around the conference room table, Mark Schwartz started to vent.

“I’ve stayed silent too long,” the 65-year-old former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner told the six other men on the board, including WeWork’s co-founder and chairman, Adam Neumann.

Mr. Schwartz aired his frustrations about the state of the company, which was perilously low on cash after years of freewheeling spending and had become the butt of jokes on Wall Street, according to people familiar with the meeting.

No more fantasies, he said, as advisers and others looked on. Now, he said, they needed to make decisions that would save the company.

Even more remarkable than the content of Mr. Schwartz’s blistering rebuke was the fact that it came so late. The banker had stayed silent so long that the story was almost over.

We Co., as the parent company is officially known, was already a distressed asset by then, undone by conflicts and the dawning realization that it was just a hip real-estate sublessor—not a tech company. A few weeks earlier, WeWork had shelved its disastrous attempt at an initial public offering and Mr. Neumann had subsequently stepped down as chief executive.

It was a spectacular fall for the company that months before had been America’s most valuable startup.

Little of WeWork’s trajectory would have been possible were it not for the collection of veteran executives and financiers from the upper echelons of Wall Street and Silicon Valley who enabled Mr.",34647,True,1576340063.0,2019-12-14 17:14:23,48,4,TheDitkaDog,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/ealke8/wsj_weekend_the_money_men_who_enabled_adam/,True,0.9,2019,elon,search,False,False,0,

1. Panasonic has X square feet of space in GF1. And has the maximum capacity to produce 35 GWH of battery cells in a year, with the current technology.

2. Maxwell DBE technology doesn't change the chemistry of cells produced. It only changes the process how the material is applied to the cathode.

3. Put simply, presently, Panasonic dissolves the material in a solvent, applies it to cathode, then dries the cathode, treats the residual solvent.

4. Maxwell DBE process makes a kind of paste of material to be applied on cathode. Applies it on cathode. And dries it up (faster, as paste dries up faster than a liquid). No need to treat any residual solvent (as there is none). So the whole process of manufacturing the cathode takes 1/16th of time & 1/2 of space. So in the area presently occupied by Panasonic, with the appropriate equipment, Tesla can produce 35x16x2 GWH of cells in a year. That is roughly 1 Terra Watt Hours (1TWH) of cells in a year.

5. Additional advantage of DBE technology is that 20% more material can be applied to each cathode in the dry process. So it increases the capacity by 20%.

6. Since the DBE technology process is simpler, cost to produce each cell is 10-20% less.

7. So, in future, Gigafactories may be renamed as Terra factories.

8. This will help Tesla produce more cells for stationary storage (mega packs etc) as well as for vehicles (Model Y, Semi, Roadster 2.0, Cybrtrk etc), without needing to build more Gigafactories in the near future, in USA.",1525,False,1576464209.0,2019-12-16 03:43:29,7,8,vinodjetley,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/eb8y2i/so_many_people_keep_asking_me_how_will_maxwell/,True,0.82,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,ecp9w1,,"AC to DC conversion, LVDC and EV charging","I’ve recently been reading about Low Voltage Direct Current and how the current AC grids aren’t really compatible with most domestic usage, which is based on DC devices (electronic devices and LED lighting mostly), and how PV panels generate DC electricity and batteries operate with DC energy, which made me think about solutions like Tesla’s solar roof and home batteries, and came up with a few questions:

1) How does Tesla manage charging in homes with PV panels and Tesla batteries? Are they providing DC straight from the PV/battery combo or is electricity being converted to AC before being delivered to the car so that it can be converted again?

2) AFAIK, the only available domestic DC charging solutions for EV’s are based on CHadeMO, which actually feature V2G capabilities, but these are not widely available yet and virtually all domestic solutions are AC. I believe that the type 2 plug has some sort of limited DC capability even without the extra CCS pins but I have not been able to find any info for type 1 plugs. Has the CharIN association contemplated the possibility of domestic LVDC charging in order to take advantage of PV/energy storage systems?

comment,ecp9w1,ecp9w1,,"I don't know the internal operation of the Powerwall, but PV panel voltage varies with temperature and insolation by up to 20%. Clamping the voltage lower still works, but wastes a lot of potential energy. Inverters use Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) to constantly seek the voltage that generates the highest output of the PV panels and hold the input there, maximizing the electrical output of the panels. The battery cells also have an optimal input voltage that varies with SOC, so getting optimal output from PV into the battery would require precise DC-DC conversions, one to match MPPT for the PV and one to match the battery charge voltage, or a DC-AC-DC conversion. Since almost all electrical needs are AC, inverters already include the DC-AC components. Whether the battery is charged DC-DC is probably based on cost and efficiency of each design.

It looks like the Powerwall 2 can be just a battery or a battery plus inverter:

While I am excited about the car itself, I can say without a doubt that their customer service is horrible. I'm still hoping to take delivery by the end of the year to take advantage of the tax credit, but there is little indication that it is going to happen. As time grows sort, I have so many questions and no way, that I know if, to reach Tesla to get answers (aside from their ""Contact Us"" email link that they seem to ignore).  So I turn to you, reddit community, to see if you have any answers or advice.

1) They say they are going to deliver the car. What does that mean? Is someone going to drive it to me? Do they squeeze a car carrier into my little neighborhood? Do we have to go somewhere to pick it up? (I'm in the SF Bay Area)

2) I need to have payment on delivery. I'm not financing, so I presume that is a cashier's check? Does it matter who it is made out to? (e.g. ""Tesla"" or ""Tesla Motors"" or ""Tesla Motors Inc"") Can I assume that the price in my account is the correct final price (see # 4 below)?

3) I got an email asking which dates I couldn't take delivery. I gave them as many dates as I could, including this Sunday. If they contacted me and wanted to deliver this Sunday, the I would have to go get a cashier's check today (as the bank will be closed over the weekend). How far ahead will I hear about delivery?

4) I have a trade-in. I was quoted a price for the trade-in, but they didn't ask anything about the car. Can I assume they will still honor this price if the trade-in doesn't run (which is why I'm buying a new car!). How will they pick up the trade in?

5) My wife is listed on the title of the trade-in. She leaves town on the 27th. What happens then?

post,efivfm,,Tesla v World on Autonomy,"Disclaimer: I own TSLA, work at Tesla (not on autonomy), and this is purely my opinion. Everything I talk about is public info.

-Background-

Basically every company doing autonomy is using lidar and simulated driving with a small amount of real world miles with their own vehicles. Tesla does not use lidar and has 100x  the amount of real world data than everyone else combined because of its massive fleet.

-Lidar

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucp0TTmvqOE&t=2h16m48s

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucp0TTmvqOE&t=2h33m33s


-Real world data

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucp0TTmvqOE&t=2h02m45s

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucp0TTmvqOE&t=2h04m40s


-Levels of autonomy

https://www.truecar.com/blog/5-levels-autonomous-vehicles/



Heres my thoughts on autonomy from Tesla's perspective

1. Best case: Maybe lidar is first to l4 but Tesla gets to l5 first.
-The moat is disgustingly large. If tesla wins autonomy how does anyone catch up? All the data from billions of fleet miles and millions of robotaxis already on the road. Cheaper due to customers putting in the capital, no lidar costs, and infrastructure taken care of (park in customer garages and customer charges maintains etc.). 

2. Middle case: Lidar gets to l5 first but Tesla follows a few years later. 
-Once Tesla gets there they will be far cheaper and eat Uber, Lyft, Waymo, and whatever other burgeoning autonomy companies exist, not to mention other automakers.

3. Worst case: Lidar gets to l5, Tesla never gets there and has to install lidar on the fleet and replan their autonomy division, whether because Elon admits his hubris or by lawsuits pouring in from customers who purchased FSD. Depending on how easy it is to do autonomy from this point, Tesla either never gets there or takes a much longer time but still ends up with a cheaper service. Tesla takes a bite out of the autonomy companies but they are so far ahead its insignificant.",2669,True,1577293612.0,2019-12-25 18:06:52,82,120,stackpack,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/efivfm/tesla_v_world_on_autonomy/,True,0.86,2019,both,search,False,False,0,

comment,efivfm,efivfm,,"I still have some doubts about what I would call ""total"" self driving, something like ""Johnny Cab"" from total recall. Partly this is due to bureaucratic inertia, there will be *some* situations, where a very good driver could make better decisions than a computer. Those situations will probably be vanishingly small, but that could be enough for the bureaucracy to say no, and they much prefer that to saying yes to *anything*.

I accept that overall, Tesla FSD is already well on its way to being safer than the average driver. I think they (you) will get to level 5 driving before the others, though some might do it first in very small geofenced areas. I don't see anyone doing wide ranging level 5 within the next 2 years.

I do agree that Elon and Tesla are going to eat everyone else's lunch, and pretty soon as well, but not in FSD. I strongly suspect that Battery Day will see several announcements that will send the stock soaring. A couple of technical things, and major contracts with raw materials suppliers, maybe even a Tesla mine? Elon is not an idiot, and he goes back to first principles,  he knows Terawatt hour production rates requires a massive step up in material sources, and he will be working to secure them.

post,ehlq1t,,Why I think Subaru doesn’t change the STI,"I was reading [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/ehfcif/name_one_underrated_car_and_one_overrated_car_but/fciy65e/), and something clicked. It has to do with the discussion post the other day (yesterday?) about Dodge knowing their target/printing money with their geriatric lineup. 

The STI doesn’t really cost Subaru as much if it stays the same. 

It’s an enthusiast car. Soccer moms in Missouri aren’t buying STIs. So to begin with, it is a small market of car enthusiasts that the car even is applicable to. It’s also only a manual-transmissioned car, so that narrows it even further. Further still, it’s car enthusiasts that LIKE what it is. There is a much larger slice of car enthusiasts that want a two-door, RWD car with a large V8. 

Back when it had the Lancer Evolution to battle with, it made news. It was on magazine covers. It was at the forefront due to the competition, and on the larger radar of the automotive world. But when Mitsubishi axed the Evo, the STI is facing a conundrum: with nothing to beat (sorry, Golf R) why innovate? Additionally, with no reason to innovate, why not cancel it as well?

Subaru is a very interesting car company. Mazda (and time an extent, Tesla) is similar in this regard - as a smaller manufacturer you need to give customers what they want. You can’t cancel your entire passenger car line like Ford because:fuck you, customers.  So, Subaru is keenly aware that the small, but vocal (and die-hard) enthusiasts for the STI deserve to have it remain in production. 

To do that, they need to cost-save as much as possible. EJ25 still work OK? Good. Body style still mostly liked by people? OK? Good. Can we get away with another year without a giant iPad dashboard? OK? Good. Let’s throw some different wheels on for 2020.

This keeps the STI in production, still giving fans and enthusiasts a car, versus another cancelled icon.",2042,True,1577710538.0,2019-12-30 13:55:38,179,265,LogicWavelength,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/ehlq1t/why_i_think_subaru_doesnt_change_the_sti/,True,0.87,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

- Grow at an exponential rate ( [Model T Production Ramp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T#Price_and_production) - [Model 3 ramps beats it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_3#Deliveries))

- Increase production while reducing costs (Surprise Q3 profit - cost reduction was not 'Priced In')

- Go Global (Gigafactory Shanghai built in 10 months - 2 more months to 1000 cars/week rate with 1 6 day - 10 hour shifts)

- Give accurate Forecasts - needed to judge growth companies (Nailed it - predicted Deliveries 2 Quarters out)

And the real money on Wall Street seems to be in agreement - TSLA - $454/share Intraday High - All Time High

Beyond this it is anyones call, but I strongly believe Tesla's unique mission will allow it to expand into the entrenched Global Automobile Market as possibly an OEM for EV subsystems; drivetrain, batteries, Integration Platforms, Recharging Network, Patent Sharing, Autonomy Platform. With a negotiated profit margin on all inequitable partnership, say, 10-30% or more. 

Tesla behaves differently because it wants more than to return shareholder value, but to transition everyone to clean transport.  Lets see if Tesla's leadership in EVs pays off in ways that benefit everyone in the long term.

post,emyypl,,A New Year a New Car! Here's my 2020 Stinger GT Limited,"Most people get the practical car first then the weekend car, I did the opposite and after two years of no vehicle to drive during Canadian winter it was time to get another car.


My only requirements were that it have 4 doors and be more practical then the Corvette. With a budget up to 60k CAD that pretty much meant anything and everything under the sun was available. For the first few weeks I couldn't make up my mind, I considered sports sedans like the Stinger, G70 and the CTS/ATS-V. I considered things like the Civic, Golf, WRX and Focus all the up to their top performance versions. I even considered a new RAM 1500, ZR2 and a used Hellcat/392.


After many weeks I came to the conclusion I wanted something that was still fun but practical and AWD was heavily preffered. So that eliminated any ideas of driving a V8 charger, Hellcat or otherwise as well as the trucks.


I looked at the Golf R, STI, RS and Type R but I'm not a fan of hatchbacks and for the price the STI felt like a terrible deal.


This left the Stinger and the G70. God this was tough. First the value proposition of a Stinger in Canada is insanity. It costs top spec the same as a US Stinger, normally similar vehicles in Canada are around 13% more expensive in Canada vs the US. This played heavily into it, 52k for a loaded Stinger, 365hp, AWD and tech through the roof is ridiculous when you consider that the STI stickers for 49k CAD. Just no contest here.


I took a trip over to my local Kia dealer, they didn't have a GT, just the 4 cylinder so I took that for a spin and liked it a lot. The car overall should be similar to the GT so if I liked the 4 cylinder odds are I'd love the GT.


Next came the G70. Genesis does things differently in Canada. There is no dealer, they ship a car right to you. I scheduled a test drive, my ideal combo would be the top 3.3 trim with red stitching and Mallorca Blue. They didn't have it available but I got to drive the 3.3 regardless.",5337,True,1578698136.0,2020-01-11 00:15:36,126,73,The_Exia,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/emyypl/a_new_year_a_new_car_heres_my_2020_stinger_gt/,True,0.9,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

My buddy has a Model 3 and its fine but not my thing, I fill up gas once a month, my city is small, it isn't for me.

As for a 3 series, or Audi S4 etc I considered them but didn't like the hp trade off for the money. An equivalent 50k 3 series, Audi etc would have under 300hp and I wouldn't enjoy the maintenance out of warranty. Not to mention they look very generic. The Stinger stands out, has the engine to back it up and the interior quality that the BMW would be better at when compared to the Stinger isn't worth the trade off. The Stinger interior in my opinion is nice and I'm not an interior snob so moving to a BMW would, in my opinion, be like buying a lesser car for more money for a badge.

post,eocmz1,,Why is the long Tailpipe Argument not compared between combustion vehicles and EV's?,"So I'm a car person, and a lot of things with cars fascinate me, and in my lifetime one of the most fascinating developments has been the rise of electric vehicles.

I would like to add a note that I'm not in one camp or the other, as to me in a lot of aspects a car is a car, I'm more interested in the ""cool"" facets of technology and the ""cool"" things that certain cars have.

And I'm certainly not the type of person to bang my chest and say that every gas-guzzling vehicle needs to come off the road, because let's face it there is nothing more wonderful than the sound of a big V8, or the absolute scream as a rotary goes past you. Those cars have their own type of cool factor.

Plus the way I see it, is that if the people that don't need to have a combustion car, don't actually have a combustion car, then that means there's more fuel for the rest of us that have a passion with combustion engines.

Now one argument that I constantly see with electric vehicles, is what is known as the ""Long Tailpipe Argument""

Namely this means that during an electric vehicles life cycle, you don't factor in just the emissions the electric vehicle produces, but also the emissions produced in the mining of the raw materials, the production of the raw materials into workable materials, the production of the energy, the production of the infrastructure needed to carry that energy to the vehicle, and the end of life impact of the vehicle once it is no longer suitable for use on the road.

However I've never seen this same comparison done for a conventional combustion powered vehicle.

Now maybe I've been looking in the wrong places, but aside from the batteries, a conventional car would have the same mining and processing upkeep as an electric vehicle, and the end of life for a regular vehicle with a combustion engine would not be all that different from electric vehicle, especially when you factor in the both types of vehicle are generally recycled into their constituent components.",3625,True,1578959170.0,2020-01-14 00:46:10,27,44,Rumbuck_274,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/eocmz1/why_is_the_long_tailpipe_argument_not_compared/,True,0.72,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

People need to relax.  From Toyota to Audi it is always user error and Tesla would know before anyone else and be able to fix it OTA.    

If there are examples of acceleration accident avoidance that still get into an accident Tesla would also know the stats on that and if overall it is safer or not.

Edit2:  I see a lot of post saying let’s wait for the investigation.   To be clear NHSTA is still looking into the claims to see IF an investigation is even needed into Tesla.  You wouldn’t know it from the headlines.  Headlines like 500k Tesla may be recalled do not print that same picture. The fact that the claims were brought to NHSTA  and were spewed to the public by a short seller is questionable.

post,er6lkh,,Environmental protests in Germany over planned Tesla car plant,"On Saturday, January 18, around 250 German protesters spoke out in Berlin against American car manufacturer Tesla’s plans to build a Tesla Gigafactory, claiming that the construction of the plant will consume enormous amounts of water and endanger surrounding wildlife. 

The US automotive and energy company had announced plans in November to construct its first European car factory in Gruenheide near the Berlin Brandenburg International Airport located southeast of Berlin.

Once again taking the spotlight at the Tesla Design Center in Hawthorne, CA, the site where the all-electric utility truck made its shocking world debut, camera and production crew were setting up to film a scene near the famed Tesla Supercharger monolith.

In the images sent to Teslarati, Elon Musk can be seen inspecting the rear of the Cybertruck and its motorized rear tonneau, as film crew busily prepared equipment for the camera truck that would follow the stainless steel pickup past SpaceX.

post,etsfa4,,Gigafactory 1 development not on part with capacity needed,"As seen on [satellite pictures of the Gigafactory 1](https://www.buildingtesla.com/compare/Gigafactory%201/10-08-2017/18-01-2020/) in Reno, Nevada, there has been no exterior expansion since around August 2017 (only part of the roof has been equipped with solar panels during this time). The original goal for the factory was for it to be completed in 2020, but as of this moment the factory is still only about 30% completed. In 2017 Elon announced the development schedule would change as they found a way to use the space more effectively. A new year of completion was not announced, so it was still expected to be finished this year.

In my eyes there would be no reason for Tesla to not complete or at least expand Gigafactory 1. Tesla announced the Semi, Roadster and Model Y with original start of production/release date of respectively 2019(!), 2020 and fall 2020 (not looking at the Cybertruck as it is 2 years out). All these announcements were made after Tesla finished building [part F+ of the Gigafactory](https://cleantechnica.com/files/2019/01/Building-completion-V3.png). With the Fremont factory bursting at its seams, needing the famous tent as an extra line for Model 3 final assembly and them cramming in a production line for the Model Y, there would be no way production lines of the Semi and Roadster would fit. And I don't expect them to fit in the unfinished Gigafactory 1 either, as I reckon they have been fitting that factory to the brim with all the battery and powertrain production for the Model 3 and Y. So where are they making the Semi and Roadster? Model Y's have been spotted a lot the past few weeks, but no sightings of new Semi trucks or Roadsters while these all should be ready within single digit months. Also, Elon has said on multiple occasions that the Model Y would probably sell more than the S, 3 and X together, but how would they produce these if there already wasn't enough room to produce Model 3's last year?",3682,True,1579967834.0,2020-01-25 16:57:14,34,57,_-q-w-e-r-t-y-_,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/etsfa4/gigafactory_1_development_not_on_part_with/,True,0.69,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

comment,etsfa4,etsfa4,,"The reason GF1 hasn't expanded is quite simple: they already have enough capacity.

GF1's current capacity is 35 GWh, which by itself is enough for around 443k US-made Model 3/Ys, plus 4 GWh of energy storage. For reference, Tesla produced 302k Model 3s last year and deployed 477 MWh of storage in Q3.

According to a recent [Elecrek article](https://www.electrek.co/2019/12/30/tesla-gigafactory-1-panasonic-ready-ramp-up-battery-cell-production/), GF1 ~~will~~ could soon ramp to 54 GWh, ~~presumably without expansion~~ though it is unclear whether this would require expansion of the building.

**Edit**: Here is the relevant quote from the article:

>Allan Swan, the head of Panasonic’s US battery manufacturing unit based inside Tesla Gigafactory 1, said that they could now ramp up to 54 GWh:  
>  
>“For us to move to \[54GWh\] should not be so hard. We now have the knowhow to do it in quite a high volume environment,”

I'm not saying they don't need to expand, but it's not a dire issue yet. Tesla is expected to produce somewhere in the ballpark of 650k cars this year, 150k of which will be built at GF3 in Shanghai, and the other 500k at Fremont, of which about 75k will be Model S/X and 425k will be Model 3/Y. Of all of these, only the 425k Model 3/Ys will be getting battery cells from GF1. Assuming an average pack size of 70 KWh, these cars would require 30 GWh of cells.",1878,True,1579973987.0,2020-01-25 18:39:47,34,0,brandude87,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/etsfa4/gigafactory_1_development_not_on_part_with/ffihhit/,True,,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,ffihhit

post,ey1kga,,Acceleration Boost Upgrade and Refund Experience,"**Update**
Refund posted to my card within 12 hours of making the request in app. Only regret is not buying $2k of TSLA on Friday instead of the boost :)

I decided to buy the AWD boost on Friday night and give it a go for the weekend. Seems there are a lot of questions floating around as to how the process works, so I thought I'd share my experience.

TL;DR Do it if you want to try it. Seems like Tesla thought this through and put in the work to automate as much as possible in order to minimize contact rates. Screenshots [here](https://imgur.com/a/a1ywUKC).

**Purchase**

Friday night, I purchased it in app using Apple Pay. Modal in-app says I have 48 hours to request refund. Apple Card was charged immediately, and the transaction cleared the following day. *Side note: I have no idea how anyone butt purchases this. I tapped Purchase, which loaded another webkit view where I had to tap Purchase again, and then I had to auth with Face ID.*

After purchase, the boost shows up in the purchased tab of the upgrades page, and there are links to view my invoice and request a refund. I go into my garage, and sport mode is on my car. Of course I go for a drive.

**Experience**

<48h time lapse>Lots of driving and smiles on my face. Boost is significant after about 35mph but very minimal from a stop. Would like to see same level of violence from 0mph as I did from 35+. Picked up a buddy with a non-boosted AWD and took him for a ride. He wasn't impressed from a dig, but he laughed like a girl from a roll.</48h time lapse>

**Refund**

Tonight I got home from a Super Bowl party (go Chiefs) and requested the refund. There are three options along with a comments box. I filled it out and had to double confirm to request the refund. The confirmation notification said I will receive a refund within 3-5 business days, and within minutes the boost was removed from my car (drive modes back to standard and chill).

This is likely to address the remaining concerns back in October from [2019 Q3 earning call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/24/tesla-inc-tsla-q3-2019-earnings-call-transcript.aspx): “Now we need to work on solving the intermediate portion which is traffic lights and stop signs, and navigating through … windy narrow roads in suburban neighborhoods.”

Notably windy roads are difficult because the lane edges can leave the view of the main camera, and similarly traffic lights and stop signs can be hard to see from the stop line when using only the main camera. Here’s a screenshot from a [greentheonly video](https://youtu.be/OdKA5Y7nXMY?t=25) where Fisheye camera has enough vision to predict the yellow lines while Main camera barely sees the right edge of the destination lane and fails to make a lane prediction.

Also from greentheonly videos, you can count the frames between neural network updates where Main camera updates every frame while all other cameras update every 4th frame.

post,f2ufj4,,"Should We Buy Tesla Stock Now? Here's What Earnings, Charts Show"," Tesla stock has a history of being erratic, with its mercurial Chief  Executive Elon Musk frequently drawing attention with bold claims about  production and profitability that have been a challenge for analysts to  discern.  
 

Now, with production of the **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA))  Model 3 in full swing, including at its new China plant, and with the  company's Model Y and Cybertruck truck in development stages, Musk has  defied skeptics once again.  
  Tesla stock has surged to record highs over the past nine weeks,  reaching a market valuation above $100 billion for the first time, on  Jan. 22. Tesla is up more than 208% since Oct. 23, the day before it  jumped more than 17% on an [earnings-fueled gap up](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-earnings-jump-third-quarter-profit/). 

&#x200B;

 Among recent catalysts for Tesla stock: Billionaire investor Ron Baron said he believes the company has the potential to hit [$1 trillion in revenue in 10 years](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-continues-climb-on-positive-comments/). In addition, [Baillie Gifford & Co](https://fintel.io/soh/us/tsla/baillie-gifford-), Tesla's top shareholder outside of CEO Musk, disclosed that it's raised its stake to 7.67% from 7.46%.  
  With its market cap now close to $141 billion, Tesla overtook **Volkswagen** ([VWAGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VWAGY)) as the second most valuable auto company. But it's behind Japan's **Toyota Motor** ([TM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TM)), which has a market cap of about $198 billion. The market cap of Tesla is more than **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) and **Ford Motor** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) combined.

post,f5v3ek,,Tesla domestic battery production for EVs and the Westwater Resources (NASDAQ:WWR) source materials underdog,"I think we are familiar with the speculative but generally accepted rumor that Tesla will start producing its own batteries based on their acquisition of Maxwell technologies. 

Lithium Ion batteries have mostly two ingredients in them: lithium and graphite. Neither of those come from domestic sources, with most lithium coming from South America and most graphite coming from China. Westwater Resources (WWR) is a small cap publicly traded corporation that mines both, in addition to uranium which I won't comment on because it is not relevant to Tesla in the near term. WWR retooled a few years ago to do battery products by purchasing a graphite plant and exploring for lithium in what we would all consider in hindsight to be an excellent bet.

WWR owns the only near-term graphite mining site in the USA, and has several exploratory lithium brine sites in the country. Right now their plans are to create a pilot plant and process 20 tons of raw material they purchased in order to satisfy customer testing, and then by 2022 they will have completed their graphite mining and processing infrastructure. The graphite chemistry is incredibly important because that is where the energy is stored when the lithium ions are pulled across the electrolyte. There is also about 3x more graphite in a battery than lithium. 

The supply of graphite in the world is about static, with threats of export controls from China. We certainly don't want to be dependent on them for energy infrastructure. Our best solution is to get the graphite right here. If Elon puts out his battery manufacturing plans as we suspect we can expect there to be a massive demand for the source materials and for them to look for the best accountability path.

Right now the needs we are meeting are whatever Panasonic can put out, plus whatever is going into laptops and smartphones.",3196,True,1582046074.0,2020-02-18 18:14:34,28,24,dgcaste,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/f5v3ek/tesla_domestic_battery_production_for_evs_and_the/,True,0.77,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

Companies like Rivian and Bollinger were at least able to provide a vehicle to show, more than 12-24 months from release. If that's a reasonable timetable, why don't other startups show off even a single concept prototype and often just have a render?

Don't take this as FUD, I would love nothing more than to see every new startup produce new models for the market, I just wonder how many are clever marketing and a flashy website vs actual manufacturing capacity. 

a few that come up from my research:


 - 2021 Lordstown Endurance
 - https://lordstownmotors.com/
 - Still raising funds, only recently obtained manufacturing space in Detroit. No word on start of production.
 - No official images beyond a drawing/render on their website.

>I believe this one to be a bit more likely. They say they're showing off the truck at Detroit. Still a lot of unknowns.

 - Faraday Future FF91
 - https://www.ff.com/us/ff-91/
 - First unveiled in 2017. Pre-production model created in 2018.
 - Working vehicle has been demonstrated at events.
 - Filed for bankruptcy this past October.

>Loved the design, but kinda given up on this one becoming a reality.

 - Atlis XT
 - https://www.atlismotorvehicles.com/
 - $1M received from crowdfunding campaign. https://www.startengine.com/atlis-motor-vehicles
 - No working prototype publicly seen. only CG renders on company website.
 - Website claims 15-minute full charge with new battery tech, decreasing to 5 minutes in the future.
 - V2G, Liquid-cooled battery, Solar connectivity. They claim to have their own skateboard Chassis platform they want to license out.
 - Supposedly, there was an event at their HQ this past Friday but no news articles to speak of.

post,ftu1oy,,Manifesto (in short some important stuff on the market),"Suggestion:
Dear manufacturers, car owners, carmakers and modders. In this post, I would like to give you an idea, a possible direction of making electric cars more affordable and better.
1* Please for the love of my parents unify the chargers. It's impossible to find a charger to fit your car. You have to carry 10kg of adapters for your car to drive freely. Please standardize the charging points and make them accessible licence free online for us to modify them to make them better (lighter etc.)
2* Better battery cells. Please don't pretend it's the early 2000. Use the latest tech battery cells. I recommend using LiFePo4. They are not that different to popular LiPo but unlike them, they are not flammable, and easier to use. They are nearly 3 times lighter than popular cells. The best representation of that is that Tesla 3 with these batteries would be 350kg lighter. Making it a 1t car.
3* Try using reusable energy sources to better the range. I installed solar panels on my friend's charging station to make it more affordable. It would be great if you installed solar panels on the car roof, boot or even front. They are affordable and bendable. They are already being used on campers and military vehicles so they are easy to buy. In my upcoming project, I`m using turbofan to charge my batteries on motorways (highways). That way the power comes from solar panels on the roof, fans being grill already cooling batteries and regeneration braking. And from battery and motor heat (want to know more ask me in the comments).
4* Make batteries easy to change for example so you can swap mustangs battery with chevy volt. Now when you break a battery you have to order a specific one and wait about a month for the shipment. That would make eco-driving more user friendly and would make companies compete in their cell qualities.
5* Use wheel hub type motors.",6223,True,1585859880.0,2020-04-02 22:38:00,7,13,Automatitiongeek,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/ftu1oy/manifesto_in_short_some_important_stuff_on_the/,True,0.89,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,fvj7or,,Someone on Quora made a really good point on why it’s a good idea to go all-in on Tesla.,"I was 50-50 on QQQ and VTI. However after reading this post I am gonna switch to all-in on Tesla. I think they’re gonna grow as big as Ford, GM and so forth one day. Below is the full post. 

https://www.quora.com/How-does-Tesla-continue-running-and-making-cars-if-they-lose-money-every-year-From-where-do-they-get-the-money-to-continue/answer/Steve-Baker-100?ch=10&share=3dd4d100&srid=uumtx


“You are falling for a common line put up by Tesla-haters and short-sellers.

Tesla does sell cars for more than the cost of making them. Some estimates say 30% more.

For people like you and me - we’d call that a “Profit” and by the standards of the car industry, it’s a very good one…but it’s not strictly profit if you go and spend it all.

Remember: For all the noise that’s made about them, Tesla are a TINY company. Ford and GM each make between 5 and 7 million cars every year. Tesla makes about 300,000 cars per year (2019). They are a tiny fly-speck of a company compared to VW and Toyota - both of which dwarf Ford and GM.

WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE EXCESS MONEY YOU MAKE?

So what should Tesla do with that “profit”? Put it in the bank? Use it as a stock dividend to pay back their investors? Pay back their loans ahead of schedule?

NO!!!

That would be completely, INSANELY, STUPID!!

Tesla, have Model Y owners who ordered a car and will have to wait a year to get it. As of February 2020, they had 550,000 pre-orders (and climbing) for the CyberTruck and they haven’t even chosen the site for the factory they’ll have to build to make it in!!

When you have a HUGE backlog of orders, the only sane way to proceed is to grow the company - and to keep growing it until you can meet the demand for your product.

Therefore, they should take every spare penny they make and every penny they can borrow and use the money to build more factories!!

More factories means more cars can be manufactured - which means MORE money to build MORE factories.",6737,True,1586113390.0,2020-04-05 21:03:10,0,11,Okmanl,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fvj7or/someone_on_quora_made_a_really_good_point_on_why/,True,0.36,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Got my car back and things do look better. They cut out and installed a new glass roof.   Everything else is within Tesla specifications. Tesla is an adjective in that sentence.

This also prevents non-authorized repairs to battery packs or other hazardous materials, which is desirable in an industrial context but not necessarily good for consumers.

Of course, this just creates a situation where car electrical repairs have to be tackled with the same seriousness as home electrical repairs. This day has been coming for a long time, but Tesla will probably force mechanics in general to do better here (no more wirenuts, tin solder or electrical tape) as other companies adopt similar standards.

New Stock investor here, I have been thinking about going into the stock market since the big dip of feb 27, but I didn't know anything about stocks, and I am not US citizen so the process was much more complicated for me, now I am ready to go in, I have 9k USD available to invest and 4k more within 3 weeks (I will still have about 20k USD in saving don't worry).   


I know dollar cost average is the way to go and I am planning to do that anyway, but since the market already regained a lot of the loss since the big dip I feel like a lot of the stocks are now overvalued as well, so I am not sure which stock should I start to buy first and which to hold off on, the more I read the more complicated everything seems to get.

I want my portfolio to consist of blue chip stocks with a lot of room for growth or with steady and increasing dividends, I am ok with the volatility in the short term but I want big gains long term (I will continue investing after the virus is gone), here is the list of stocks that is on my watch list that I thought match my criteria (most of them increased in double digits since I added them on the list so I am no sure anymore),    


DIS (Disney) (I know that the parks are closed and their Cruz ships are not operating, but I feel like that will quickly be fixed with vaccine/cure)

MSFT (Microsoft) (Pretty safe and have been growing for the past few years)

Qcom (Qualcomm) (it has a lot of ups and downs, but will likely have great revenue from 5G and Autopilot chips). 

V (Visa) (Pretty safe and have been growing for the past few years and I think will gain more internationally when people deal more with credit card instead of dirty cash)

MA (MasterCard) (same as visa)

HD (The Home Depot) (Good dividend, increases often, stock price is usually going up, dominant in its market).

post,g33o28,,Cars all electric in 30 years? The real numbers.,"Hi, just recently I tripped over a YouTuber who claimed that in 30 years petrol cars will be past. Being an electrician, I couldn't help myself and calculate the real odds for that. I'll be 62 at that time and it seems like a good number to go with. So, let's hop in to the numbers and see what we have here. For simplicity, I'll be calculating only the U.S.A. The numbers are actually relatively easy to extract from data.

In 2019 US have used 142.23G gallons or 538.4G liters of gasoline or almost 5PW of chemical power.

1L of gasoline = (roughly) 9kWh worth of power.

Our efficiency number for gasoline car will be only 20% (in favor of EV's).

9,000\*0.2=1800 = only 1.8kWh/L of actually delivered power.

538.4GL\*1.8kW=969.12TW per year or almost 1PW/yr to run cars at 100% efficiency. That's no heaters, lights, autopilot, power steering etc.

Now, let's match it.

One NPP block = 1GWh of power, that is 24GWh/day and 8.76TWh a year.

970T/8.76T=110.73 nuclear power plant blocks needed to match.

Yes, you need to build 111 nuclear power plant blocks just to cover gasoline cars. That's some 1,000,000,000,000$ of private sector investments in nuclear power over next 30 years if not counting inflation, or 46 Elon Musks.

But, this is fun, let's go ""ecological"".

Largest windmill: 10MWh that's 87.6Gwh per year and 11,073 gigantic windmills in NON STOP WIND to meet the demand. Windmills realistically cost 1M$ per 1MW so the largest one will ring at around 10M$, not counting delivery and installation. Full rig to meet demand will then cost  110,730,000,000$ windmills only. Realistically you'll need double that and massive energy storage network to account for weather shifts.

Let's go solar: 1m2 = 300Wh. Let's be generous and give them 12H full sun a day (not even possible), that is 3.6kWh a day and 1.314MWh a year/1m2. You need 738,204,957m2 of panels or 118,112,640,000$ to meet demand. Realistically though you'll need at least double that to actually cover demand.",3843,True,1587135770.0,2020-04-17 17:02:50,0,14,Paegaskiller,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/g33o28/cars_all_electric_in_30_years_the_real_numbers/,True,0.37,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

post,gadhod,,$TSLA: some stats out of China autos recovering from COVID-19,"Analysts at Needham held an Expert Call on Monday which provided some interesting stats out of China and outlook for the global auto industry recovering from COVID-19.

1. In China, 2020 light vehicle production is projected to decline 5% to 12.5% y/y, according to rating agencies and industry sources. However, the auto market there is recovering, with OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers returning to pre-pandemic levels. By end of March, auto plants in China are operating at 97% capacity vs. 60% in February.
2. On the demand side, country-wide return-to-work appears to be strengthening consumer confidence and demand for vehicles. Adding to that demand are federal + regional stimulus programs for electric vehicles. Multiple Chinese cities have also relaxed restrictions on license plates for EVs (such restrictions have been used as a measure to manage congestion). However, total units are expected to still be below 2019 and 2018.
3. Behavioral wise, Chinese consumers have shifted more towards private vehicles to avoid shared vehicles (benefit to auto demand), but they're also leaving their homes less and have grown more accustomed to delivery (headwind to auto demand).
4. $TSLA has been by far the leader in China's EV market, selling 12k Model 3 alone in March, well ahead of second place BYD (sold 5k EVs), BAIC (4.5k), and BMW 5 Series PHEV and Ford Escape PHEV lagging behind (under 3k). Including both luxury EVs and non-EVs, Tesla was the 2nd best selling in the country after Mercedes C-Class, but the clear leader in Tier 1 cities (Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen). Chinese consumers also have a tendency to discount Chinese brands vs. global brands.
5. Caution against using China as a benchmark for recovery timeline in EU/US. China was able to flatten the curve and recover in 4-6 weeks due to its integrated coding system that identifies every person that needs to be quarantined based on their mobility patterns. Such an invasive surveillance system is not possible in EU/US.",2215,True,1588180899.0,2020-04-29 19:21:39,2,3,street-guru,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/gadhod/tsla_some_stats_out_of_china_autos_recovering/,True,0.75,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,gbxt7y,,Lets talk Tesla...,"I see a lot of people advising others to invest in Tesla stocks and it is talked of like a unicorn stock which will keep rising forever. So I have dug away at the numbers and here are some comparisons to take into account;

Ford, Lincoln, Troller, Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche, Seat, Skoda, Volkswagen, MAN, Scania, Ducati, Alfa Romeo, Dodge, Lancia, Maserati, Chrysler, Fiat, Jeep, Ram, Peugeot, DS Automobiles, Opel, Citroen and Vauxhall.

These are the brands of VW Group, PSA, Ford Motor Company and FIAT Chrysler, together they have over 300 factories worldwide, they have a combined turnover of $650 billion, they employ 879,000 people and they sell nearly 25 million cars per year.

Tesla currently have three factories, their revenue is $24 billion, they employ 48,000 people and they sell 350,000 cars per year.

As things stand today Tesla is valued at $130 billion, the other four companies combined are valued at $121 billion. I believe this proves beyond any doubt that Tesla is vastly overvalued, personally I believe its true value is around $15 billion.

If you are one of the people who keeps seeing YouTube videos telling you Tesla is the stock to have and you are considering investing a huge sum of money into it then please think long and hard about it. To me the hype around Tesla is very similar to Bitcoin in late 2017, the price was rising and rising and nobody knew when it would peak, but eventually the market will correct itself.",1474,False,1588385242.0,2020-05-02 04:07:22,0,7,Perennial_Phoenix,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/gbxt7y/lets_talk_tesla/,True,0.5,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,genu1a,,Decoding Elon's Success,"So, I wasn't even a huge fan of Elon before I started researching him for a brand new podcast and article series which I'm calling *Success Decoded*.

I've wanted a Tesla badly ever since I watched the Model X unveiling live in 2015, and had a lot of respect for him, but just didn't know much about him except that he was part of Paypal.

I chose Elon to profile first as he is the most interesting, accomplished and visionary person in the world. 

Now, I would *definitely* consider myself a **huge** fan.

So the podcast is completely ad-free, just wanted to focus on pure value.

It's gonna be a 3-parter:

\- Part 1 is out, and it's 30-mins on Elon's early life up to when he sells Zip2 and becomes a multimillionaire. 

\- Part 2 will be about SpaceX, Tesla, and all the industries he's disrupting. 

\- Part 3 will be the analysis of his success and what lessons we can learn.

I've tried to make it as accurate as possible, using the Vance biography plus loads of interviews with him (especially ThirdRow one which was awesome).

I've also tried to make it a relaxing listen. It's the first podcast I've ever produced so any and all feedback welcome!

post,ggtq30,,My Tesla Bear Argument,"Not too long ago, the sentiment on Tesla across Wall Street was that it was a failing company that was nearing the end of its cash pile, yet a few upgrades from analysts later, the stock had position itself to be one of the strongest in the automotive industry. Up 242% YoY, I can't seem to comprehend what attracts investors and institutions towards this stock, as not much has really changed, fundamentally with this company. I am going to share my view on Tesla and try and debunk each bull theory, from my point of view.  


* Tesla is 5 to 10 years ahead of its competitors

If you had said this to me about 12 months ago, I would've agreed with you, back then, it felt like the moat around Tesla's battery technology and the supercharging network was simply too much for others to catch up in a reasonable time frame. The release of the Porsche Taycan however, changed everything for me. Despite what you may say about the car's price, the Taycan is simply an amazing car and shows that the VW group is just steps behind Tesla in terms of  EV tech. With a real-world range of \~280 miles and a price \~100k to 130k USD with options, it presents itself as a viable option for those who may otherwise be shopping for a Model S. Moreover, it showed that Tesla was simply not great at building cars. The Taycan has a much better chassis and cooling design than the ""compatible"" Model S and Model 3. This extends further to the build quality, where Tesla cars still suffer from large panel gaps and imperfect paint jobs, despite having had 2 years to iron out these production issues. Europe was a hot market for Tesla through 2019, but its dominance will fade with the introduction of EV from big German automakers that are targeting the same segment as Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y (BMW i4 2021, Audi Q4 2021, Mercedes EQA 2021, VW ID series, etc..)

post,gni8vc,,"Online companies threatening my brick-and-mortar store, should I team up with local competitor?","Im selling a product in my brick-and-mortar store that’s almost exclusively sold online. There are a lack of brick-and-mortar stores for this item, and took a chance to see if there would be a demand for in-person vs online. It’s been very successful. Many people like the convenience of being able to receive the item same day instead of waiting a lot longer. There are millions of people in the metropolitan area my store is in, and only two stores that sell this item (my local competitor and I). 

The online companies have been very threatened by this, to the point of trying to steal Local SEO by paying for sponsored articles/posts/ads. Let’s call the item “Item A”. Basically when someone searches on google “Item A near me” in my area, then my store and my competitors store pops up on google maps. The sponsored posts have titles like **Why you shouldn’t search for “Item A near me”****Why buying Item A locally is dangerous**. One company has even paid for an article in a local magazine (in my area) to write about how bad local Item A stores are. They talk about how local stores sell counterfeit “Item A” or how local stores aren’t knowledgeable about it. How online companies are superior to them in every way. 

This is complete bs. There is no difference in products between in-person vs online, In fact in-person can be better because they interact with a real life human instead of just through email. Anyways, it’s gotten to the point where the semi-defamatory articles are becoming a real problem and threat to my business. I’ve thought about contacting my local competitor to team up with them to figure out a way to combat this, an “enemy of my enemy is my friend” situation. Do you guys think this is a good idea, and do you have any other ideas on how to deal with this issue?

SpaceX's target is enabling humans to live on other planets, whereas Tesla aims at making living comfortable and sustainable. Furthermore, both, to a certain extent, share a common goal: saving humans. SpaceX is doing this via plan B, which is taking humans elsewhere so that we survive in case of a planetary level extinction event (Climate Change, for eg.), and Tesla is doing this by trying to replace gas powered vehicles and introduce solar tech as rapidly as possible. 

In terms of collaboration, there have been multiple cases where a certain development/invention at Tesla was utilised over at SpaceX and vice versa. Furthermore, a good reason for not giving Tesla up would be that the company is Musk DNA through and through. The only reason it exists and didn't go bankrupt is Musk's fighting will and how he transferred that to his employees, and while he may not have had the idea of a 'Tesla' per say, he's displayed a keen interest in ultra capacitors for a long term, and they're now used in Tesla battery packs.

I thought a lot about the frameworks and mindsets that are needed to make decisions in the imperfect information world of poker, and how it would be extremely applicable to building startups.

Being able to think probabilistically, think long term, and not be results oriented are critical skills needed for founders and startup employees. I wrote a book about this, and I've made it free to read on Amazon until Thursday May 28th! I think this community will enjoy the book, it deep dives into these frameworks, and gives fun poker examples and real life business cases including Netflix, Airbnb, Uber, and more.

post,gs9bhc,,"$TSLA - Goldman sees price cut as a ""modest negative""","Tesla's website showed price reductions for multiple models as of May 26, 2020. It reduced the starting price for a base Model 3 by $2k or 5% to about $38k, and reduced the price for both the Long Range Plus and Performance Model S/X by $5k or 5-6%. Tesla made no change to the Model Y price.

Tesla said in late April it would reduce price of its standard range Model 3 in China so keep its eligibility for government incentives, and also previously said it would likely reduce prices more broadly as costs fell. However, Tesla didn't specifically mention a near-term price reduction pending for the US market. The street had been modelling ASP reductions more due to mix shift than outright price reductions.

Goldman believes the recent price reductions may be in response to: 1) more aggressive incentives in the light vehicle market more broadly (industry incentives in April were up more than 25% y/y to \~$4.3K per vehicle according to Autodata), 2) improved cost for Tesla, and/or 3) due to weaker end demand.",1017,False,1590682906.0,2020-05-28 18:21:46,4,21,street-guru,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/gs9bhc/tsla_goldman_sees_price_cut_as_a_modest_negative/,True,0.75,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,gvcuey,,Why you should buy TSLA before its too late,"For those who think TSLA stock is over valued, its only shoot up even more. So many people are buying DGLY as a spec stock for the protest, imagine the potential for TSLA stock. Imagine the potential cyber truck have on the market after the protest. Many of the police cars have there windows broken and lit on fire, as well as many other civilian cars. It will be logical to think that after the protest is over the police will buy something that will be more protective to prevent that from happening again like the cyber truck with the strong reinforced windows. On top of that many police and civilian cars are destroyed so there will be some demand for cars.

If you watch the jay leno video of the cybertruck at 1:00, you can hear elon musk jokingly say how when the apocalypse come we should be glad that its bullet proof, we are a leader in apocalypse technology

This is just not for the police, seeing all these video on police brutality, correct me if im wrong, but from what i recall, most of the deadly encounter with police occurs when there is only a single police officer. If you own a cybertruck and get pulled over by an aggressive police, you can always say im staying here until your supervisor comes to de-esclate the situation. What is the police going to do?  smash the window? that's not happening. On top of that, many of these incidents are gone unrecorded and require police complaince of turning on there body camera, there are also instances where it is not  on. Owning a Tesla, you have sentry mode to protect yourself.

In california, Model 3 not only outsell cars from its own segment, BMW 3 series, but they also outsold honda civic and toyota corolla.

post,h7ojke,,Intelligent drive systems,"I went from a 2016 SQ5 which had no 'intelligent drive' features apart from blind spot monitoring and parking sensors/rear cam to a 2020 C43. 

I have a lot of highway driving for my commute about 50 kilometres each way, and my work schedule requires me to often drive home late at night when I'm tired. 

I was very interested in getting a Tesla and the model 3 when was first being announced due to their autonomous driving features, but the look was not to my taste.

I put down a deposit on the Polestar 2 because they also will have ""autopilot"" and I like how it looks but their delivery estimate was Q3 of this year and I needed a car sooner. So I had to cancel it. That sucked as I was really looking forward to it.

In the end because I could not get an electric car that I wanted and I didn't want a big car but I wanted  awd I ended up on the C43.

I checked off the intelligent Drive option without really looking into it, I thought it would be the usual lane departure warning, adaptive cruise, 360 camera.

What I found over the past few months of driving it approx 6000 km,  is that I can't imagine how good the Tesla system must be if this is what Mercedes has in their 2020 model. 

My car on the highway basically driving itself, speeds up/ slows down, comes to a complete stop and starts up again, follows curvy roads, recognize the speed limit changes and then slows down to match the speed limit or speeds up. It even changes lanes!

I feel so much more comfortable driving home at night. It even has an attention assist.

I know autonomous driving is still quite far off but I I'm so excited to see in the next couple years when I have to send this car back what my options are going to be.

5/ TSLA brand synonymous w/EV
6/ Huge runway: EV 3% share, 25%  by 2025, 100% by 2030
7/ Biz model: word-of-mouth, social media, customers as advocates
8/Growth driven by TAM expansion, leverage brand to new segments

Case for 2030 TSLA $8,000 PT:
1/ TSLA currently has 17% share of the global EV market, and EVs hold just 2.7% of the global auto market, so TSLA has just 0.5% share of the overall market of 80M veh/yr. By 2030, EVs likely to hold 100% of the market (remember stick shifts?)..

post,hq9xfh,,"Please, Don’t Get Your Hopes Up-","I feel it’s necessary for someone to talk about this.

Battery Day expeditions are so out of reality right now, it’s really concerning. This is mostly from new Tesla owners and uninformed investors. YouTube channels like (notably) TeslaBruh have been spreading disinformation about this for a while.
——-

“1. Battery day will have revamps and new cars”

I have heard so many theories about a compact coupe or a revamp of S/X.

There is no evidence to support any of these claims. 
——-

“2. Battery day will have immediate impacts.”

I see this a lot, YouTube videos like “Supercharging will be obsolete after Battery Day”

Density per square inch of a battery can only be so high. Right now, I think per square inch, electricity is 70% less efficient than gasoline. Physically, that number can probably only get to around 20% - in years and years. 

I don’t think you see physical battery impacts from battery day until Giga (Tulsa or Texas) is up and running. Nevada is (probably) not ready for an extra battery facility yet. Switching up the current supply lines could be a bankrupting mistake, especially without a fallback option.

[Giga Nevada Production ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/transportation/2018/11/30/18118451/tesla-gigafactory-nevada-video-elon-musk-jobs-model-3) 
———-

“3. Your battery will get ‘bigger.’”

I don’t know where to begin with this one.

Your battery will not get bigger. Chances are Tesla releases a software update that maximizes efficiency for older cars, maybe adding range to your car, but your battery ain’t getting bigger.

post,hvkkg1,,Tesla Battery Tech Advantages Widely Underappreciated By Market,"The battery is the heart of the electric vehicle, which is why Tesla puts a lot of effort and investment into its development. At the upcoming Battery Day, the company promised to provide investors with the results of its work in this critical area. However, Tesla's battery technology is already excellent and the gap will only widen over time, said Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster.


Munster argues that Tesla's leadership in battery packs is sustainable, and Tesla's competitive edge in batteries is currently underestimated by investors.

 

""We believe Tesla has a competitive advantage in batteries that is under-appreciated by investors. In the future, we expect that advantage to widen.

Bottom line: Tesla’s lead in batteries is sustainable and other auto OEMs will struggle to gain measurable ground on the company’s 80% US EV market share.""

Most of the lithium-ion battery cells used to make the Tesla battery are manufactured by Panasonic at Gigafactory 1 in Nevada. Loup Ventures estimates that over 60% of Panasonic's battery production currently goes to Tesla. The two companies recently signed a three-year pricing agreement for the production of battery cells at Gigafactory Nevada.

In addition, the Californian company has partnered with the Chinese battery supplier CATL and South Korean maker LG Chem. However, Tesla itself has proprietary cell chemistry that is different from the cell chemistry that Panasonic, CATL, and LG Chem sell to other automakers.

""That said, Tesla is experimenting with its own battery cell design through its 2019 acquisition of Maxwell Technologies. If those efforts yield a breakthrough in performance, Tesla would keep the cell design and chemistry proprietary. Separately, based on the company’s 2019 acquisition of Hibar Systems, we expect Tesla will begin manufacturing its own batteries in the next three to five years.""

Elon Musk said Tesla Semi truck will be built in Gigafactory Austin (or Giga Texas) and the work has already started building Tesla's largest Gigafactory so far. 

During the conference call following Tesla’s Q2 2020 financial results yesterday, the automaker’s management team made new very brief comments about Tesla Semi trucks' production plans and location. ""We’re going to be doing a major factory there. And it’s also where we will be doing Cybertruck there, the Tesla semi program, and we will be doing Model 3 and Y for the eastern half of North America,"" said Elon. 

Jerome Guillen, Tesla’s president of automotive and the head of the Tesla Semi program, added some comments about the plan during the same call: ""We’ll start production next year, as we announced before. I personally care very much about the project. I can’t wait. We do have a few trucks that keep driving around and that can deliver cars. But we’re going to accelerate that. I want to be clear that the first few units, we will use ourselves, Tesla, to carry our own freight, probably mostly between Fremont and Reno, which is a fantastic test route. We’re going to prove that we have very good reliability. So far, the early units do have it, but we’ll do that at a larger scale. And we have also promised some early units to some long-term, very patient, and supportive customers, and we’ll do that.""

We maintain our Strong Buy rating as: 1) we continue to expect solid long-term revenue growth; 2) increasing monetization of newer platforms; 3) we believe expense guidance is likely conservative; 4) we believe valuation is attractive at \~24x our 2021E GAAP EPS (ex cash) vs. 15-20% LT EPS growth.""*

**BMO:** *"": We expect near-term trends to be among the strongest in our ad supported coverage universe and we continue to believe boycotts are relatively immaterial to near-term revenue (supported by our Ad Check calls). But we also think this is largely baked into expectations and remain at Market Perform largely due to a balance of opportunity (Shops, Marketplace, and other commerce initiatives; see our first take on Shops here) offset by risk (potential headwinds to targeting, safety and security spending driving down margins for “open” social media).""*

**RBC:** *""Based on intra-quarter data points, and our model sensitivity work, we view current Street June quarter estimates as reasonable and H2:20 estimates as reasonable to modestly conservative. Read thru from TWTR & SNAP is ambiguous to slightly cautious with neither company providing strong evidence of a V-Shaped recovery in Online advertising. However, both provided evidence that Direct Response advertising was performing better than Brand and neither cited benefits from migrations due to FB ad boycotts.",2916,True,1596130390.0,2020-07-30 19:33:10,0,7,street-guru,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i0qaut/fb_analysts_dont_seem_overly_concerned_about_ad/,True,0.5,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,i5jdxo,,"Sen. Sanders proposes one-time tax that would cost Bezos $42.8 billion, Musk $27.5 billion","Under the bill, tech and other business titans who have seen their wealth shoot up during the pandemic would take huge charges. Amazon and Walmart, for example, have both seen their stocks grow as Americans increasingly relied on their services during stay-at-home orders during the pandemic.

That added billions of dollars in wealth for their top shareholders, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT) founding family the Waltons, respectively.

Here’s how much some would pay under the bill due to wealth gains between March 18 and Aug. 5, according to a [release](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/make-billionaires-pay-fact-sheet?id=788A69A1-3162-4E3D-BC12-0BB8346423A0&amp;download=1&amp;inline=file) accompanying the bill:

* [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos would pay a one-time wealth tax of $42.8 billion.
* [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TSLA) and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk would pay a one-time wealth tax of $27.5 billion.
* [Facebook](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg would pay a one-time wealth tax of $22.8 billion.
* The Walton family would pay a one-time wealth tax of $12.9 billion.

Those figures could rise (or lower) as the effect of the pandemic on the billionaires’ wealth changes over the rest of the year.

I have a 2015 85D Model S

Heavy investor in TSLA (paid for both cars, thanks Elon!)

We purchased a Model Y to replace an old SUV. The girlfriend's parents live on a dirt road. A road we've taken many times with the S and all other cars we've owned. This damage is from a single trip! I kept the speed around 25mph.

The picture is after cleaning the car. Every single white dot you see is a paint chip. Unbelievable. I'm sure a clear bra would have mitigated most if not all of these but who knew I'd basically have to wrap the whole car?? Don't make the same mistake I did.

Don't buy a Model Y unless you stay in the city or get the rear doors wrapped.

You nailed it 10,000%. I think I figured it out. Elon is continuously saying ""What is the simplest/cheapest we could possibly make this?"" And this is why the car is missing stuff like physical door locks, side-view mirror controls, floor mats, etc. This doesn't necessarily help YOU, it helps Tesla save $$$ from the cost of the car.

* Technically we should be able to ship out all spare parts as required, no need to keep spare parts in stock! No need to open more service locations because in theory, everything should be doable by sprinter vans!
* Deliveries - Delivering a car should take 5 minutes! (many many delivery horror stories, car being in wrong place, show up and there's damage to the car, VIN unattached, delivery people don't return calls, customers show up and wait around for 2 hours and have to go back home.. etc.)
* Sales - Everyone is laid off, effectively immediately!!!! (whatever happened to that?)
* Paint - ""Technically, the paint is on the car, it went through our paint shop... therefore, you see... it has been painted.""

post,ii4j0z,,‘It’s been priced in’ not so sure..,"I see this comment a lot when people are talking about buying a stock because of a future event. 

Gonna use Tesla as an example.

I’m long on Tesla and will be for a while, and I think this run up is partly to do with the split but also people realising they could literally be the biggest company in the world by the end of the decade. 

But I don’t really get the idea of the whole ‘priced in’ analogy.

The stock is at where it is now, and who knows, it might be there because people are excited on what’s to come. Let’s pretend it’s at 2200 because of all their future innovations. But what happens when Elon releases FSD, unleashes the robotaxi network, confirms first solid deliveries of the cybertruck and announces the new Roadster, the stock is just going to go up isn’t it..?

Regardless of what event is ‘priced in’, when that big event happens like any of the above, the news will still drive the stock price up, so no, it wasn’t really priced in. I think there’s a distinction between the excitement of something happening (driving price up), and the actually event happening, which will just put it up more.

* Shortcuts to creating great content quickly - so you can still run your business!
* Simple formulas for creating compelling blogs, videos and more
* A how-to system to set your content distribution to autopilot

So, no one has decided to make a $40k + electric vehicle that compares more to a go kart in terms of quality than the rest of the car manufacturers in the industry?

So how can he say that the rest of the industry is behind Tesla? He specifically states all the ways Tesla fails at simple things and then says the product they make is unique in the market, and somehow in his head that equals Tesla being way ahead of the rest of the industry. I feel that a more accurate idea is that Tesla is doing fun experimental shit that is great and *hopefully* going to help drive innovation but nowhere near reliable enough for the normies.

I did some research into NIO. I know it has been operating at a loss, but I like their business model, in particular the battery swapping system and the recently launched BAAS( battery as a service); you can buy the car without battery at a huge discount and then subscribe to loan a battery. I think long term this model may be better than the Tesla supercharger system( it prevent the batteries from deteriorating). The problem I see is that it seems a business model difficult ( or at least expensive) to export outside China, and one that make impossible for them to sell cars outside China before building swapping stations in the countries they want to sell cars.

post,inr451,,Intel : the big picture and why I'm bullish on it,"I will start off my discsussion using a couple of examples where investors/analysts missed the big picture and the company/stock has proven that they're much more than that.

**Microsoft**


In July 2013, Microsoft stock had the biggest drop of the century after reporting their earnings. The stock dropped because of investors disappointment in the Surface RT laptop. They ignored the biggest elephant in the room that is Windows Azure, now known as Microsoft Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing division and it has been the major growth driver for Microsoft. Of course, the CEO change from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella helped but Satya's vision was all about cloud computing and it was completely ignored by investors at that time. 

https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/19/as-shares-fall-12-percent-microsoft-experiences-its-biggest-drop-since-2000/

**Apple**

Back in 2018, investors/analysts were focusing on iPhone X sales figures. Warren Buffett saw the big picture. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said long-term investors of Apple’s stock shouldn’t obsess with near-term iPhone sales. “The idea that you’re going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point,” he stated. His big picture was looking at Apple as a brand and its ecosystem

https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/30/warren-buffett-says-he-bought-just-a-little-more-apple-recently.html

Look at where Microsoft and Apple stocks were then and where they are trading at now.


**Intel**

I'd like to use the same logic for Intel. It dropped 20% after the earnings call last quarter in July. The big picture  Intel's Investors/analysts are  missing is that they are ignoring this industry leader’s methodical transition into higher growth businesses and focusing solely on solvable supply chain problems ( 10 nm/7 nm transistor density issues).

This is what I would consider “hard money”, since you need a certain sequence of things which you have no control over to come into play to win big on this deal.

On the flip side, “easy money” would be something like Generac (GNRC). They primarily provide generators (both residential and commercial) and have increased revenues YoY plus have introduced new product lines (to cover new markets like solar, for example). 

California is currently under brownout periods with the threat of having blackouts. This will persist as the weather just won’t cooperate for folks. We just had a hurricane hit the US too and we’re bound to have a few more weather related incidents before the end of the year. People need electricity. They will be buying generators to ensure that their lights stay on. Generac is a beneficiary of these needs and continues to benefit with more negative weather events causing more folks to buy their products.

(P.S: Apologies for any grammatical and typo errors, I’m doing this from my phone and will edit if I spot them once posted)

Ive had the car almost a week now and have driven over 300 miles in it. I’ve driven it over a mixture of A and B roads (these are the more narrow twisty but fast roads in the UK), also motorways and country lanes.

The review will be as follows: 1: The first minute, 2: Outside, 3: Inside, 4: Handling &amp; Performance, 5: Technology, 6: Living with it. 7: Verdict.

The exact model I have is the A250 e saloon AMG line with premium pack. In white with black AMG 5 spoke wheels and black interior with red stitching.


1: The First Minute

The car was delivered from the back of the lorry, having only tested the hatchback version, even from looking at pictures I was not 100% what the saloon would look like “in real life”. After it rolled off the lorry and into my driveway I was in awe of its dimensions. It didn’t look like a hatchback trying to be a saloon, it looked like a car in its own right. I had to read the back of the car to convince myself that this is an indeed an A Class, the baby of the pack. But baby it was not. It’s as big the older CLA bar a few shavings here and there and was surprisingly wider than I thought. It’s sleek, the back end tapers off nicely towards the rear of the car giving it a pleasing aerodynamic curve.

Nikola ([NKLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NKLA?p=NKLA&.tsrc=fin-srch)📷) and GM ([GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM)📷) are teaming up to take on Tesla’s cybertruck.

The electric truck startup announced Tuesday it has selected GM to be its manufacturing parter for its electric pickup truck dubbed the Badger. The Badger will use GM’s widely acclaimed Ultium battery technology. Additionally, Nikola will hand over $2 billion in stock to GM — giving the automaker an 11% stake in the company.

“Nikola is one of the most innovative companies in the world. General Motors is one of the top engineering and manufacturing companies in the world. You couldn’t dream of a better partnership than this,” said Nikola founder and executive chairman Trevor Milton in a statement. “By joining together, we get access to their validated parts for all of our programs, General Motors’ Ultium battery technology and a multi-billion dollar fuel cell program ready for production. Nikola immediately gets decades of supplier and manufacturing knowledge, validated and tested production-ready EV propulsion, world-class engineering and investor confidence. Most importantly, General Motors has a vested interest to see Nikola succeed. We made three promises to our stakeholders and have now fulfilled two out of three promises ahead of schedule. What an exciting announcement.” 

Added GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra, “This strategic partnership with Nikola, an industry leading disrupter, continues the broader deployment of General Motors’ all-new Ultium battery and Hydrotec fuel cell systems. “We are growing our presence in multiple high-volume EV segments while building scale to lower battery and fuel cell costs and increase profitability. In addition, applying General Motors’ electrified technology solutions to the heavy-duty class of commercial vehicles is another important step in fulfilling our vision of a zero-emissions future.",2498,True,1599566389.0,2020-09-08 13:59:49,1018,438,addictedtostuckporn,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ios954/nikola_and_gm_team_up_to_make_900horsepower_super/,True,0.94,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

And even if by some Noah's Ark scale miracle they succeeded at all of the above, they still have to compete with Tesla. Who btw, already builds electric cars and electric trucks. 

And not only do they not have a commercial product, they don't even have an assembly line to build their imaginary hydrogen truck, to the point where they just shelled out 10% of equity to borrow a *real* car company's factory...who will probably just steal all their best designs once they're done cooperating.

post,ipcn8b,,Germany wants to become a pioneer in autonomous driving. Wants to be the first country to allow autonomous driving by 2022,"So yesterday there was a car summit in germany between our government and car industry. 

Bullet points:

- German car industy wants to become pioneer in autonomous driving  
- autonomous driving to be allowed by 2022  
- no more premiums/bonuses for combustion cars  
- israelian System Mobileye is very advanced  
- BMW, Daimler, Audi are investing in their own technology as well  
- new bills are being talked about right now  
- Managers arent sure products will be ready by 2022. They estimate 4-5 years  
- German courts are critical towards Teslas Autopilot (note: mainly because of its name i think), but they have already hardware installed that looks very promissing and ""not far away from regular operation""  
- Car manufacturers should be encouraged to share their data  
- Government wants to fund/pay for a data cloud where everyone has access to  
- There is talk about letting an AI handle navigation to avoid/reduce traffic

*If Tesla is going to justify a half-trillion market capitalization, it needs to increase its sales from $24.6 billion in 2019 to approximately $140 billion by 2030. This would require an annualized growth rate of 19 percent, and end up with the company becoming as big as G.M. and Ford are today.*

*At the same time, Tesla also needs to expand its net profit margin, the money earned for shareholders per dollar of sales. By our calculations, its net margin will need to increase from minus 3.5 percent in 2019 to over 21.5 percent by 2030. That means that by 2030 Tesla’s margin would converge to what Apple’s is today. Toyota is among the most profitable big automakers, and its margin in its latest fiscal year was around 7 percent.*

post,iq5wdn,,Question re: 2020/2021 outlook for Business (Import/Export)," 

Hi guys first time poster in this sub, I'm hoping for some additional insight.

My partners and I specialize in AI driven B2B Brokerage (connecting Supplier A with Client B).

We've recently successfully exited the PPE space, and want to apply our success there with the Manufacturing world in other markets. we've made headway with manufacturers in China, Vietnam, USA, Canada and Morocco who want us to connect them with buyers, and there's no shortage of options or demand.

which brings me to my question: we can essentially go in almost any direction with regards to sourcing, whether it be raw, semi finished or finished goods; we are a little overwhelmed with the vast options out there as a starting point/industry/product .

we're looking for products/markets that will have a significant demand/uptick throughout the next year either as a result of the pandemic and new production cycles, or not.

our interest is volume deals, and collecting a performance fee/commission on the deals we bring.

Which market (NOT PPE) would you propose to focus on for the next 6-12 months ?

TL:DR - Have an Artificial Intelligence company that is doing commission driven lead generation. Which markets/products would you suggest to focus on as they will be in high demand over the next year?

post,iw0dvg,,A Deep Dive into Nikola's FCEV Design and Price Model,"Hey everyone.  I'm a mechanical engineering student with a hobby interest in finance.  I've spent the last few days figuring out if Nikola's leasing model is actually possible.  There's some really wacky stuff going on in Nikola's presentations and financial projections, and I wanted to share my findings.

&#x200B;

This is an absolute wall of words, and I wouldn't be offended if you didn't want to read it all.  In the first half, I try to tease out the cost per mile of an actual Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) given the specification Nikola lists.   Next there is a portion where I look at the discrepancies between their Financial Projections and their Lease breakdown.   Then a quick little peanut gallery where I look at their unrealistic assumptions and the hypocrisy of their comparisons.  Finally, a more serious portion where I discuss the design, efficiency, and utility implications of Nikola's chosen power output and battery capacity.  Hope you guys enjoy!

&#x200B;

Let's get started:

Nikola claims that they have the industry first holistic leasing program, including maintenance, fuel, and use of the vehicle. They plan on leasing for $.95 per mile @ 30% margin.  This implies an expense of ~~$.73~~ $.67 per mile to Nikola.

**Hydrogen costs:**

According to the DoE, it currently costs $5.10/kg to produce, compress, and dispense hydrogen.  Nikola claims they can do this for $2.47/kg.  I highly doubt their estimate, and will elaborate on that later.  Hydrogen has a specific energy 33.3 kWh/kg.  A Fuel cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) has an average thermal efficiency of 55%.  A diesel semi tractor, which easily compares to Nikola’s offerings, consumes about 1.25 kWh of work per km (or 2.125 per mile) of useful work loaded.

This implies the Nikola truck will use 3.86 kWh of hydrogen per mile, at a cost of $0.59 per mile, or $.29 using their estimates.",20755,True,1600548077.0,2020-09-19 22:41:17,1111,196,thri54,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/iw0dvg/a_deep_dive_into_nikolas_fcev_design_and_price/,True,0.97,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

post,ix4uwt,,I feel I am a “wantrepreneur” and I am seeking ongoing coaching.,"
Without trying to sound as I want sympathy, but more that I want you to have a background of who I am, where I currently stand and where I know I can go. 

I grew up in a small town in Texas in semi violent broken home, father left when I was 1 so then was raised by my mother and 2 older sisters. I moved in with my aunt and uncle at age 17 when my mother was on life support and almost passed. She’s still alive but her health is that of an 85 y/o and she’s only 62. 

After high school I begged my way into this healthcare company as a grunt worker because I thought the female sales reps were hot and the guys looked badass in suits.  Months after joining the company at age 20 they were starting a new healthcare sterilization consulting (ensured that sterilization departments in hospitals for surgery were in compliance with regulations, efficiencies, process improvement, resource management, surgeon satisfaction, increase surgeries, ROIC, education etc.) division in which required me to leave Texas for Georgia, so I said “what do I have to lose!?!” 

Fast forward 13 years (age 33) with the company and I held various cap positions due to promotions and just being relentlessly resourceful. My positions were; technician leadership, project management, surgical liaison. I worked in over 60 hospitals across 36 state’s and finally achieved my grail a full blown consultant.

I know no longer work for the company as I wanted to stop travel and get married so I got a management job at a hospital in which I was suspiciously canned 1 month. So basically for these last 3 years I have focused on building a viable consulting service not only in the direct field I was in but business in general.

post,ixyrff,,"Elon Musk says Tesla deliveries will rise 30% to 40% in 2020, touts new battery tech","Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday he expects vehicle deliveries to increase by 30 to 40 percent over last year, when the company reported deliveries of 367,500 vehicles. The new guidance from Musk implies deliveries of between 477,750 and 514,500 cars, a range that encompasses the company’s previously stated goal to deliver half a million cars in 2020.

Musk offered the updated numbers during the company’s 2020 shareholder’s meeting on Tuesday afternoon, which was accompanied by a presentation about Tesla’s battery advances. After thanking Tesla owners for their word-of-mouth marketing, he noted: 


“In 2019, we had 50% growth. And I think we’ll do really pretty well in 2020, probably somewhere between 30 to 40 percent growth, despite a lot of very difficult circumstances.”

The company’s shares dropped more than 6% during the presentation, which took place after normal trading hours.

During the “battery day” portion of the presentation, Tesla confirmed that it is making its own battery cells at a facility in Fremont.

Joining Musk on stage, Tesla’s senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, Drew Baglino, described the new cells as a “large tabless cell,” with a “shingled spiral” design. The cells are larger than the ones Tesla purchases from Panasonic and other suppliers, and offer “thermal benefits” which make them appropriate for use in electric vehicles. 

Baglino said battery, manufacturing and design changes underway at Tesla would eventually “unlock” a 54% improvement in the range of the company’s vehicles.

Musk, who is famous for being overly optimistic on such matters, said with all the battery and manufacturing advances Tesla is working on: “About 3 years from now, we’re confident we can make a very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that’s also fully autonomous.” 

Near-term, Tesla says it aims to produce 10 gigawatt hours worth of its new battery cells at its pilot plant within a year.",5172,True,1600817049.0,2020-09-23 01:24:09,1940,461,Brothanogood,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ixyrff/elon_musk_says_tesla_deliveries_will_rise_30_to/,True,0.94,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

post,j1z2f8,,"To what extent is Tesla really ""overvalued""?","### Disclaimer

I do not have a financial position in any of the companies mentioned here, and have no intention to initiate one within the next 72 hours.

&#x200B;

# Introduction

A common belief is that Tesla is grossly comically overvalued. Most people who express that belief point to Tesla's insanely high price to earnings ratio (P/E) to make the argument.

Tesla's current P/E is (1038). A P/E of 1000+ is patently absurd. To compare with high growth technology companies (FAANG):

* Facebook: 32.31
* Apple: 36.42
* Amazon: 131.34
* Netflix: 122.87
* Google: 27.75
* Average: 70.138

[Source (Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/)

Despite not enjoying the massive margins of the tech companies, Tesla has a P/E ratio 14.7 times greater than their average. This is simply ludicrous.

&#x200B;

# Caveats

While Tesla's P/E ratio is Prima Facie outrageous, I am of the opinion that it doesn't paint the full picture:

* Tesla's margins per car are around 20%.
* Tesla's profit margins were 1 - 2%.
   * This is a very low profit margin that leads to a relatively tiny denominator. Tesla has only just begun to turn a profit, and the margin is expected to grow significantly in future.
* Tesla's revenue growth over the last 5 years is > 50%.
   * Tesla's growth is one of the causes of their low profit margins as they're investing a lot in new factories.

&#x200B;

The below excerpt sums up my take pretty well:

>Alphabet in 2007 was clearly cheaper than Tesla is today. Alphabet’s price/sales ratio was only moderately below Tesla’s level, but its price/book ratio was much lower. In addition, Alphabet had meaningful profits, which traded at a relatively modest P/E ratio of 50 – a steep multiple for most companies but not for one growing as rapidly as Alphabet. In contrast, **Tesla has only just begun to turn a profit.**

post,j28ihg,,Walmart Triples Tesla Semi Order In Canada,"Walmart Canada has more than tripled its order for Tesla Semi trucks in a show of confidence for the all-electric heavy-duty vehicles and the ability of its maker to deliver them.   

The Canadian division of retailer **Walmart, Inc.** [WMT 0.08%](https://benzinga.com/stock/wmt#NYSE) said Tuesday it reserved 130 of the trucks. Once in service, Walmart will have one of the biggest electric truck fleets in Canada as part of a companywide goal to [achieve zero emissions by 2040](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/walmarts-goal-for-its-trucks-no-more-diesel-by-2040). 

""I'm excited to have my drivers drive this truck,"" Francis Lalonde, Walmart Canada's vice president for transportation, told FreightWaves.

Walmart Canada expects to get its Teslas in 2021. Lalonde wouldn't detail the delivery schedule, but said the company has full confidence in **Tesla Inc.** [TSLA 0.51%](https://benzinga.com/stock/tsla#NASDAQ) ability to deliver them.

""We trust our partner,"" he said.  

The Teslas will operate within Canada as part of Walmart's private fleet of around 300 trucks with about 500 drivers. Their 500-mile range provides a good fit for Canadian fleet operations, which have drivers return to their distribution centers each day.

Walmart Canada has looked at other zero-emissions vehicles, but the Tesla Semi has so far proven the best one for its fleet, Lalonde said. Beyond the range and ability to haul 80,000-pound loads, the Tesla safety features — including its collision-avoiding autopilot — were an important selling point. 

""I firmly believe these are the safest trucks out there,"" Lalonde said. 

## ‘We've done our homework' on Tesla, Walmart executive says

Walmart Canada plans to have 20% of its fleet converted to electric power by the end of 2022. It hopes to have the entire fleet running on an alternative power source by 2028.

It also has no qualms about being an early adopter of the Tesla Semi.",2753,True,1601414498.0,2020-09-29 23:21:38,65,12,Brothanogood,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j28ihg/walmart_triples_tesla_semi_order_in_canada/,True,0.9,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

The company description below comes from a recent Business Wire article.  I can't provide the link as a certain other company can't be mentioned in the link itself:

> Hyliion’s mission is to be the leading provider of electrified powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle industry. Hyliion’s goal is to reduce the carbon intensity and GHG emissions of the transportation sector by providing electrified powertrain solutions for Class 8 commercial vehicles at the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO). Hyliion’s solutions utilize its proprietary battery systems, control software and data analytics combined with fully integrated electric motors and power electronics, to produce electrified powertrain systems that either augment—in the case of Hyliion’s Hybrid systems—or fully replace—in the case of the fully electric Hypertruck ERX system—traditional diesel or natural gas fueled powertrains and improve their performance. By reducing both GHG emissions and TCO, Hyliion’s environmentally conscious solutions support its customers’ pursuit of their sustainability and financial objectives.

**Investor Presentation**

As someone else wrote here, [Hyliion (HYLN) is not the next Nikola.  This is a good thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j03etb/hyliion_hyln_is_not_the_next_nikola_this_is_a/)

As can be shown in the presentation:

1) HYLN has its defined niche: Class 8 trucks.  Not even Tesla will be competing in this field, for a decade or more.

2) HYLN has a total addressable market of $800 billion in the US alone.  One customer, Agility, operates in 100 countries.

""Q3 deliveries fail to beat recently raised expectations TSLA reported BMO Q3 deliveries of 139.3K vehicles with 124K model 3/Ys, slightly above consensus of 136K and 122K, respectively. While this is impressive, given the recent leaked email from Musk (reported by Electrek) and increased Street expectations, we suspect this will come as a material disappointment to bulls.""

""Given the lost day due to full server outage at Tesla a couple of weeks ago, we suspect the company to chalk up the ability to have delivered more without the lost productivity and noting the 145K production figure. We suspect skeptics to question demand.""

""What does this mean? Tesla has operated well during a tumultuous year. Q3 deliveries effectively cement a miss to the 500K guidance. So where are current expectations and what is the chance of achieving this? Current consensus of 480K for 2020 would put the Q4 bar at 161K deliveries.""

Tesla is the firm that pushes forward continuously, it is a driver for innovation and a benchmark other car makers are trying to catch up to. It creates innovation, in softwarem drivetrain and in batteries and spends little time trying to innovate in things other carmakers do better. 

The latest innovation is the octovalve, a stroke of genius. Before that it was offsetting magnets in the motor to produce more torque at the wheels. Before that it was the batteries... And so on...

You buy a Tesla for the sole reason that it does what other carmakers never though of doing before and forces the other manufacturers to play catch up.

Incidentally, Tesla is going to be very busy in the next 5 years in saturating the home market (USA), the current most favourable market for EVs (China) & the  future most favourable market for EVs ( Europe).",874,False,1601955327.0,2020-10-06 05:35:27,1,0,vinodjetley,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/j5wcau/will_tesla_build_any_new_gigafactory_terafactory/g7v2tcv/,True,,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,g7v2tcv

The company, started by William Li Bin in 2014, delivered 3,226 of its ES6 sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) in September, a year-on-year increase of 87 per cent, according to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). In August, its sales rose 58 per cent, with the company selling 2,840 ES6s.

Tesla, on the other hand, led the sector by quite a distance last month, by a margin of 8,103, having delivered 11,329 of the Model 3 cars built at its Shanghai-based Gigafactory 3. In June, however, the gap between Tesla and Nio was wider, at 12,478, with 14,954 Model 3s sold and 2,476 ES6s delivered.

“Strong sales over the past three months have cemented a belief among China’s home-grown new energy vehicle companies that Tesla is not unbeatable,” said Gao Shen, a Shanghai-based independent analyst covering the manufacturing sector. “Chinese carmakers, although still lagging behind their US rival, can eventually catch up if they churn out proper and affordable products for domestic drivers.”",1076,False,1602850316.0,2020-10-16 14:11:56,315,150,coolcomfort123,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jc8oa8/chinese_electriccar_bellwether_marque_nio_narrows/,True,0.93,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

We all know Elon loves to surprise people - and this is probably on the future docket.

UPDATE: TL/DR: looks like they just filed with SEC for Starlink in moving vehicles. BOOM CALLED IT. 

https://www.teslarati.com/starlink-moving-vehicles-tesla-fcc-application/

I drive a 2020 Model X. I was on the freeway in autopilot just looking at my Robinhood app (safely of course...) and I was waiting for it to load. waiting... and waiting... We all know the internet on a Tesla isn't exactly the best. It's pretty dull to be honest. And then it got me thinking... Why? Why is the internet so bad on a Tesla. Surely Elon has a reason to overlook such a fundamental detail of an otherwise very futuristic car. And then I started down the rabbit hole....

I remembered a series called ""Future Car"" with Neil Degrassi Tyson a few years back and there was this quote that he said that always stuck with me (i'm paraphrasing as best I can here..)...

""In the future - cars will be able to travel within 2 inches of each other at 200 mph... because cars will talk to each other. One car will be able to hit a pot hole in the middle of a lane, and then communicate to a network to the rest of the fleet that a pot hole exists there, and to avoid it. The rest of the fleet can then maneuver safely around it.""

It was at this point then that I looked over at my dashboard and admired the new Tesla update - the fancy schmancy new Suspension update that shows the real time bounce and shock rate of each strut. Man that's a lot of data....

post,jfks8m,,Tesla crushes Q3 Earnings with record profits,"

Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) third-quarter earnings for 2020 saw the electric car maker post $8.771 billion in revenue, beating Wall Street’s expectations. The results, which were discussed at length in an Update Letter, were released after the closing bell on Wednesday, October 21, 2020.

Tesla’s third-quarter was impressive, with the electric car maker producing a total of 145,036 vehicles comprised of 16,992 Model S and Model X and 128,044 Model 3 and Model Y. The company also delivered 139,300 vehicles comprised of 124,100 Model 3 and Model Y, as well as 15,200 Model S and Model X.

Tesla’s strong Q3 results were likely due to the Model Y ramp in the United States and the increasing Model 3 production at Gigafactory Shanghai. With these, expectations were high that Tesla would once more post a profit this third quarter.


The following are the key points in Tesla’s Q3 2020 Update Letter.

REVENUE
Tesla reported a revenue of $8.771 billion for the third quarter, beating Wall Street’s expectations. In comparison, Wall Street expected Tesla’s Q3 2020 revenue at $8.28 billion, as per FactSet consensus. 

EARNINGS
Tesla shareholders saw non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.76 in the third quarter. In comparison, Wall Street expected Tesla to report a gain of $0.57 per share.

Here are some of enormous advantages (there are much more of them) of Tesla that people speak about, what do you agree on?

\- They will earn 10 times more on each car than usual car company on gasoline car, while they still keep losing money on their EVs

\- Tesla will create the self driving technology and it will earn them a huge amount of money by using the cars as robotaxies, no one is near, because of the huge amounts of data they collect

\- The insurance of car will earn billions because the FSD (full self driving and autonomous driving) will reduce the car accidents by 99% in several years

\- Tesla is going to be the electricity grid company, and it will give them another huge area, and in this area too, they will dominate because of their ability to innovate

\- They will sell as many cars as they produce, because they can reduce prices, they earn 25% on each car, and they reduce constantly the production costs

\- The capacity will grow from 500K now to 2 million cars per year by 2022 (adding Austin and Berlin, enhancing Shanghai, others may be added, India talks)

\- They do not waste money on ads and on dealers, these expenses will go to the customers and the stock owners

\- They do the vertical integration will reduces the expenses dramatically

\- They are innovators, they figure out how to do the car innovations (more than 100 significant innovations) that make cars better in any parameter, while other companies succeed to copy only 10% of what Tesla does

\- They have a huge technical advantage over other car companies and this advantage is only growing

\- Tesla users are fans because they understand how amazing their products are, similarly to Apple, the biggest company in the world

\- Tesla has a huge advantage on their own battery cells, and it is patented, it will be 50% times cheaper and 50% higher capacity, will last 5 times longer, just amazing

post,jgandy,,FSD/Robotaxi Adoption,"I’ve been a Tesla/TSLA owner and Elon fan since 2012. I believe in their mission, vision, products, technological achievement, and more.  

One thing I’m a pretty big skeptic about is the adoption of FSD, especially for the robotaxi use case.  I get that there is a large amount of people out there that may live in more urban areas who don’t want to own a car, and just need one to take quick trips/errands.  There are also many other use cases like sending my kid to school or practice.

But then, there are a lot of people, dare I say the majority, who: 
- see owning a Tesla as aspirational
- covet, take care, mod their Tesla
- love to drive their Tesla and find joy from their Tesla (Elon has said this is the most important thing)
- don’t necessarily want their Tesla model to also become the next generic yellow taxi

Then there’s also the general public who are:
- afraid or skeptical of new technology
- can be downright hateful of new technology (picture people road raging on slower moving robotaxis)
- who aren’t going to let go of their driving ie “don’t tell me I can’t drive” similar to “don’t tell me I can’t have my gun”
So basically the deniers and those that refuse to believe the good that can come out of autonomous cars (lives saved, better for environment, more productive time, etc).

I wonder if the sum of all of this, along with slow legislation, is the usual political and social quagmire that we see all too often in our country right now?

post,jjuf16,,Consumer Reports: Tesla Autopilot 'a distant second' to GM's Super Cruise in hands-free test,"Tesla Autopilot 'a distant second' to GM's Super Cruise in hands-free test: Consumer Reports

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co's (GM.N) Super Cruise once again edged Tesla's (TSLA.O) Autopilot in an evaluation of 17 vehicles equipped with active driving assistance systems (ADAS) by Consumer Reports, the testing organization said on Wednesday.

A Tesla Model Y fitted with Autopilot finished ""a distant second,"" the group said, to a Cadillac CT6 equipped with Super Cruise, which GM is rolling out to more than 20 vehicles - including its new Hummer electric pickup truck - over the next three years.

Safety and insurance researchers have frequently warned of the risks of consumers overestimating ADAS systems' abilities, a misconception increased by some automakers calling their products Autopilot, ProPilot or Co-Pilot.

In 2018, the Cadillac CT6 with Super Cruise scored higher than a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot, in a Consumer Reports test of just four vehicles equipped with ADAS.

In the latest test, conducted this summer on a track and on public roads, the Cadillac scored 69 points out of a possible 100, while the Tesla scored 57. A Lincoln Corsair equipped with Ford Motor Co's (F.N) Co-Pilot 360 system, finished third with 52.

The critical difference in the Super Cruise system is a driver-facing infrared camera to make sure he or she is paying attention to the road and is ready to take over manual control when necessary, said Kelly Funkhouser, head of connected and automated vehicle testing at Consumer Reports.

The group noted that Autopilot can shut off abruptly in some situations, while Super Cruise did a better job of notifying the driver when the system is disengaging.

In recent European safety testing, a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot placed sixth out of 10 systems, getting high marks for performance and ability to respond to emergencies, but falling short on its ability to maintain a driver’s focus on the road.

The headlines will make it seem that tesla failed in other areas in comparison to supercruise, but the data is more nuanced than that.

Also, cool to see supercruise is neck and neck in a few areas with tesla autopilot . 

Obviously though, these systems are still in major development, and I wonder how both systems will look several months later as this current test was conducted in the summer with autopilot version 2 while Tesla is releasing the beta for the **rewrite** at this moment, which is said to be able to learn, adjust, and scale more  quickly than the autopilot software before the rewrite.

post,jk4pxy,,An extensive Lotus Elise Review,"I’ve always wanted to experience a Lotus Elise. Unlike some Lotus fan boys I don’t particularly have a moral affinity for the Lotus “add lightness” and driver focused ethos (although I think those two things make these very enjoyable cars), I’ve just always thought that the Elise looked really cool and was the most exotic looking thing that I could actually afford. 

With my birthday coming around the corner, and after finding myself constantly browsing through Elise listings, I decided to rent one to see once and for all what the car is all about. 

I have a few disclaimers that I would like to add. 

I have spent extensive time with the following vehicles: C5 Corvette, C7  Corvette Grand Sport, C8 Corvette Z51, Alfa Romeo 4C,  718 Porsche Cayman Base, 997 Porsche 911 Turbo, Lotus Evora, Ford Focus RS,  Tesla Model 3 AWD, Audi R8 V8, and Audi TTRS. I will be forming my opinion with this pantheon of vehicles in mind. 

I find that a lot of Elise reviews focus too much on the car’s uniqueness and don’t do a good job of explaining how the car stacks up to other vehicles. While I won’t be doing an in-depth comparison per say, I do want to try to illustrate what this car might mean for other enthusiasts who have experienced other vehicles already. In other words I’m not going to go “Oh my god the trunk is so small” every YouTube review says that already. I’m going to really try to focus on the intangibles that don’t get highlighted in magazine or YouTube reviews. 

**Power** 

As somebody who owned a C5 Corvette, C7 Grandsport, and currently daily drives a Tesla Model 3 power was a major concern for me when driving the Elise. The car only has a 190HP engine with around 130LB/Ft of torque. Yes it is in a 2000lb-ish body which gives it a good power to weight ratio but that’s still not a whole lot of power on paper. 

The good news is that the Elise’s engine is strong enough to give you a very satisfying time in the car.",23308,True,1603951148.0,2020-10-29 06:59:08,144,50,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/jk4pxy/an_extensive_lotus_elise_review/,True,0.94,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,jljdrm,,The Economics of Airlines,"
The Wright brothers flew the first plane in 1917. At the time, going on an airplane was not common. Being a passenger on a flight was expensive. The focus for airlines was luxury. As time has passed, their focus has shifted from luxury to revenue. With the shift, airlines have grown their revenue sources. Airlines not only make money from passengers. They work with businesses to generate revenue.

## Bags
The range and fuel costs depend on the size and weight of the plane. The passenger bags add more weight and decrease the revenue for the airline. The airlines make up the costs by charging passengers for the bags. The heavier the bag then the more money a passenger will pay.

## Seats
A passenger has the option for three different seats. The seats available are economy, business, and first-class on an airline. The first-class and business classes are more expensive than economy seats. The economy seats account for the most revenue of any seat. There might be 20 first-class seats on a plane, which are the most expensive. But 30 rows of economy seats, the great number of economy seats leads to more revenue. The economy seats account for 80% of the seats on the plane. When fewer economy seats are being sold, the airline starts to lose money on their flights.

The pricing of the passenger ticket has many factors. The airline has a formula for pricing tickets. They use the destination, flight time, type of seat, seasonality.

The airline wants revenue for flights on their books as soon as possible. To fill up flights, they make the tickets cheaper when the flight is far out. There is a certain timeline for price changes. The cheapest a passenger can get a flight is 12 to 9 months out. 9 to 1 month out is the median price for a flight. The most expensive tickets are usually one month before the flight.

## How airlines make money from cargo
Airlines ship goods for other companies. The price of the cargo depends on the size, weight, type, and time.",11356,True,1604154874.0,2020-10-31 15:34:34,5,0,SupremeRumHam,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/jljdrm/the_economics_of_airlines/,True,0.78,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

I'm a diehard ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) fan. But I can see, their time has come. Efficiency can no longer be avoided. The Model 3 is coming out to roughly 60-90 miles per gallon equivalent, based on charge costs. Huge, not to mention reduced maintenance costs.

I've also noticed there are more small displacement diesels in the US. They've always been all over other parts of the world. It is a more efficient engine, and the exhaust cleaning methods are improving  yearly.

I propose we see a shift towards a completely Diesel/Electric fuel system. The diesel fuel requires less refinement, thus less processing cost. As gasoline refinement is phased out, this will homogenize fuel production to diesel, further lowering fuel production costs, and allow governments to simplify taxation to one type of fuel and possible aid in reduction in at pump costs as well.

I've always argued we needed lower displacement and more turbos to increase volumetric efficiency. Got that. Now it's down to fuel production and distribution.

post,jm049e,,Bread Seller,"I'm working middle management in a SoCal supermarket and recently I'm given charge of a bakery inside the store. My responsibilities are ordering and selling (finished and semi/finished products depending on category), scheduling for employees and checking for compliance with health department and company regulations. The second and third parts are easy. The problem is that I have no idea how to make or sell bread.

From my previous observations of this bakery, I know that: 

1. The products are subpar quality both for their taste and visual appeal and there's not much to be done about it because the bakers must cook according to a strict SoP designed by HQ. The price tags for these shitty breads are not cheap. The profit margin is thin because of the high cost HQ charge us.
2. The employees are mostly bored women in their 50s waiting for retirement. Minimum wage with no chance for raises and being short staffed means that they are not at all motivated to work harder than normal or take on extra responsibilities. They're also prone to get in arguments about ""who does what and what isn't my job"" with one another. 
3. Among other cheat tactics, HQ would occasionally force shit products that nobody orders to the bakery and charge full cost (or a generous 5% off) for it, all the while demanding sales and profit to grow because of the ""extra push"". 

 I don't know the products (\~400 total, of which \~200 are being sold regularly), I don't know the baking process or how much work it takes to produce. I'm not a shopper, I don't follow sales, I don't know what's attractive to customers because I'm never attracted as a customer. I always buy what I need when I need and bread's never been on that list. I'm also terrible at shilling products to strangers. I'd tell the customer that the bread is shit and they can get something better for cheaper next door.

I'm used to mostly pushing papers and handling maintenance, HR and customer service.",2260,True,1604226245.0,2020-11-01 11:24:05,1,0,Triggeredandmadethis,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/jm049e/bread_seller/,True,1.0,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,jmw6mo,,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, November 2, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 2, 2020**

Stocks opened today’s session higher before paring some gains ahead of an extremely busy week, with market participants closely monitoring the results of the US presidential election, a meeting of the Federal Reserve, and the October jobs report, and rising coronavirus numbers in the US and Europe.

After an extremely choppy day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.22% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 1.11% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing 1.56% up.

On Tuesday is the US presidential election between incumbent Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result,  it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016. If this pace picks up, this election could have the highest voter participation rate in over 100 years.

Regardless of the outcome, the election will have a number of consequences for Corporate America.",8096,True,1604351118.0,2020-11-02 22:05:18,107,22,psychotrader00,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jmw6mo/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_monday_november/,True,0.96,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

post,jq1g92,,"What is a True Market Leader (TML) + And how to find them? (Ex. SHOP 2016-2020, ZM 2020, AAPL 2005-2012"," 

**TLDR:**

In one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.

TMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books

* How To Make Money in Stocks, William O'Neil
* Monster Stocks: How They Set Up, Run Up, Top and Make You Money , John Boik
* The Lifecycle Trade: How to Win at Trading IPOs and Super Growth Stocks, Eric Krull, Kathy Donnelly, and Kurt Dail

**A few Historical Examples** from William O'Neil's How To Find & Own America's Greatest Opportunities

Apple 2003 [https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5](https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5)

Netflix 2009 [https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo](https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo)

Qualcomm 1997 [https://imgur.com/oYPItOW](https://imgur.com/oYPItOW)

Yahoo 1996 [https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ](https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ)

**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal.",4128,True,1604793787.0,2020-11-08 01:03:07,328,76,Rmogo21,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/jq1g92/what_is_a_true_market_leader_tml_and_how_to_find/,True,0.94,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

When shipping to Europe, Tesla already sends the papers to the customer before the car arrives, so that they can be registered beforehand and a smooth pickup is guaranteed. That is why some German owners already have registration for their cars that are due to be picked up in late November or December.

These papers state a battery capacity of 82 kWh. On the 2019 & 2020 Model 3 the capacity in the same paper is 79 kWh. The difference matches the 5% energy density increase mentioned in the article.

So in a few weeks we will hopefully know what the ""excellent fast charge performance"" that is quoted from Celina Mikolajczak in the article actually means.

post,juc4ac,,I think I just became a believer in fun electric cars...,"Let me preface. It's not that I don't believe electric cars are the future. They absolutely are. The part I've always had a hard time believing is that they'd be able to stoke the same kind of emotions that gas powered performance vehicles can. The scream of engines, gear changes, and just all the different vibrations and feelings that come with these performance vehicles is something I struggled to understand how an electric vehicle would compete. I had the chance to drive a Model 3 Dual Motor a few months back, and while on paper the performance was really quite incredible, I didn't feel particularly moved by the car. It was just a way to get from A to B, albeit quickly.

Fast forward to today. I was at my local Porsche dealership looking at a car. As I was walking to the car, I walked past a whole line of Taycans (around 6-8), and I asked the sales adviser if they were all presold waiting on their owners to pick them up. Turns out they weren't, and they were all for sale. They were all a mix of 4S's and Turbos (no Turbo S's). Long story short, I got the keys to a 4S and went for a drive...

And my god was it fun. I cannot put into words the experience that car delivered. The car had soul, something the Tesla absolutely did not (to me). It felt like a performance car that just happened to have an electric drivetrain, not an electric drivetrain that just happened to have seats. I got back to the dealership, and found myself wondering if I wanted to trade my car in then and there.

I understand that a comparison of Porsche to Tesla is apples to oranges. But the fact that Porsche have managed to deliver a driving experience like I had today, in their first all electric production vehicle, gives me a lot of hope and optimism for the future of cars. I'm really excited to see all of the new electric vehicles hit the market over the next few years, and keep the joy of driving alive!",1910,False,1605398411.0,2020-11-15 01:00:11,120,248,wisey113,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/juc4ac/i_think_i_just_became_a_believer_in_fun_electric/,True,0.79,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

comment,jvkncv,jvkncv,,"It \_sounds\_ dumb, true, but there is more than a bit of truth here.

It is logical to charge resource maintenance payment from people using that resource as opposed from everyone via income tax or something.

Infrastructure was funded by gasoline taxes - the more you drive the more you pay. Logical and seemed like a good idea at a time as all cars used gas. This is no longer true.

Majority of road damage comes from cargo vehicles and not your typical cars - ICE or EV, does not matter. With Semi on the horizon this is a very valid concern of what to do.

You could not simply raise gas tax as ICE revolution is already here and soon (relatively speaking) there will be no gas tax at all nor any ICE on the road, hence no money for road maintenance. You can not tax power at supercharger either, because people will just set up their own chargers and avoid that tax. Setting up your own tax free oil refinery is more difficult :-)

EV initiatives and EV tax is not mutually exclusive either. So the solution should be permanent EV tax (as in the article), ideally - somehow by mileage driven.

post,jwk3hi,,How to Send a Land Rover Defender Through a Car Wash?,"UPDATE 2-9-2021: Sorry for belated response! I never got notice of any replies or that this went live. 

Unfortunately we're all still confounded as to what to do about this vehicle. I tried shifting it into neutral and exiting from the passenger side, and that did work, but it's too risky to keep doing since my foot could bump the shifter on the way over. (Also, we can't simply shut the vehicle off either, as that will still trigger brake-hold and the parking gear.) 

I tried calling a dealership since my boss told me they should know since the vehicle has to be kept in neutral to do a wheel alignment (which I assume is done without someone staying in the driver seat), but they told me they didn't know either. I read through the relevant portions of the manual about brake-hold and whatnot, and saw no actionable advice.

We'll just have to keep sending employees through with the car until a solution pops up, but these new features can sure cause problems. The Model X and Y from Tesla, for instance, tends to lock if you leave all the doors closed for a few minutes, even with the card key inside. We had to have one customer unlock it with their phone app about five  times. 

-----

I work at an automatic car wash, and we're stumped as how to send a Land Rover Defender (2019-2020 model years) safely through without necessitating someone sitting in the driver seat. 

For cars that go through without a person in them, we leave them running while in neutral gear, and some vehicles have electronic shifters that require specific processes so that they don't shift (and stay) in park or activate a brake when you open the driver door. 

For instance, we have to put Teslas in tow or transport mode, and leave the driver seat belt buckled on Dodge Ram trucks with dial shifters, but none of our tricks work on the Defender so far. The parking brake stays on, and will reactivate itself immediately if you try to shut it off.

post,jxt5tz,,3 Years with a Chevy Bolt,"I'm getting ready to turn in my Chevy Bolt after a 3 year lease, so I thought I'd share my thoughts on the ownership experience after 38,000 miles...

**Typical Commute:** 70 mile roundtrip in heavy traffic (suburban, stop-and-go highway, and urban), around 3 hours a day

**Environment:** Garage with 220V Level 2 charger, outdoor temps ranging between -20F and 100F

**Pros!**  EV powah, range, heated steering wheel, ride, steering, visibility, interior space, Apple CarPlay, low maintenance needs, relatively quiet

**Cons!**  Front wheel traction, the seats, HVAC, stupid GM things, weak switchgear, dopey styling

&#x200B;

I rage quit a BMW i3 after waking up to a fully-charged car with only 50 total miles on a 10F day.  Having to stop at a Level 3 DC charger every day for 20 minutes was getting old real fast when my commute home was already over an hour every day, so I test drove a Chevy Bolt and liked it enough to lease one for 3 years/15,000 miles a year.  I was planning to go over my mileage on the lease and backfill the difference with my Boxster, but my job ended up being converted to a WFH position last year.

Overall it's been a good experience.  I can't say I've had any moments where I looked forward to driving it, but I do catch myself from time to time thinking about how nice it is to drive.  The heated steering wheel is so, so nice on cold days and Apple CarPlay works flawlessly after a couple of iOS updates.  The maintenance schedule for the car has 3 total items: tire rotation, cabin air filter, and battery coolant flush at 150k miles.  I've done all of the tire rotations in my own garage and had the cabin air filter replaced at its only dealer visit for a software recall.

Electric range has been a non-issue with this car, the first time this has happened with any of my previous EVs.  I can count on one hand the number of times I've stopped at a public charger.

&#x200B;

# Introduction

There seems to be a strong sentiment among some that Tesla is vastly overvalued, and that the current stock price is completely unrooted in reality. I understand the viewpoint, but don't really share the belief. That's not particularly surprising as I consider myself a Tesla optimist. I decided to present in brief the case for Tesla's valuation as I understand it.

&#x200B;

# Overvalued?

Tesla's current market capitalisation appears to be grossly overvalued, especially when compared to their peers in the automotive sector as [these charts so clearly illustrate](https://preview.redd.it/gdvz8sgmpz061.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=45524ed08b3899febc3fa9b67329569e25a906b9).

In fact, the charts actually understate things as Tesla's market cap currently seats at around $464 billion. You could add another Daimler to the US and EU listed companies and they would still have a lower market capitalisation than Tesla.

This really is the case for Tesla being overvalued: it's automotive revenues is many times it's current market capitalisation. [Per MarketWatch, Tesla's trailing PE is 978.44](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla/company-profile?mod=mw_quote_tab), so it's not as if Tesla is especially profitable either.

On a fundamentals basis, Tesla appears to be grossly overvalued.

&#x200B;

# Growth

The above chart doesn't necessarily indicate that Tesla's current market capitalisation is an extremely speculative bubble that could burst soon, but more that Tesla is not valued based on its current financial situation. Tesla is valued as an extreme growth company, and it's growth over the past five years bears this out.

post,jzry9v,,"Is a 10 minute charge, 20k cycle battery for buses from Microvast too good to be true?","Microvast, a Chinese battery maker headquartered in Texas recently [announced a SPAC merger](https://www.benzinga.com/news/20/11/18330696/ev-battery-maker-microvast-in-advanced-talks-with-tuscan-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-report).

My big question about this company is, how good is their battery technology? What makes it special? [They claim that](http://www.microvast.com/index.php/solutions):

* Car can be fully charged in 10-15 minutes.
* Batteries last life of the vehicle - no replacement necessary. (I think in one article they mentioned 20,000 cycles).
* Their Smart Thermal Liquid technology makes their battery extremely safe
* Their batteries are made from [Lithium Titanium Oxide](https://www.openpr.com/news/2073035/lto-battery-market-consumption-and-revenue-analysis-by-top-key) (LTO)
* Earlier this year they won a $4.5 million contract from United States Advanced Battery Consortium for development of cheap, fast charging batteries.

So this all sounds rosy but I wonder:

* There must be a tradeoff right? If LTO is so great why isn't everyone making it?
* Assuming this battery is wonderful, what is Microvast's moat? Do they have significant technological/patent advantages? Why can't Tesla or BYD easily just copy their battery design?
* This company has some good press over the years, but it never really taken off. What was keeping them down?

Here are the facts surrounding this

**Context:**

Someone on twitter said to him (they had been spamming his replies with this):

>You know what wasnt in the best interest of people? the U.S. government organizing a coup against Evo Morales in Bolivia so you could obtain the lithium there.

He responded:

>Also, we get our lithium from **Australia**

It's like saying ""We'll Photoshop the world into a globe as much we want. Deal with it."" to flat earthers as a joke.

Sorry I don't know about that. I am way more interested in the science than patents. If it helps I believe Microvast will likely sell all the batteries they can make just like Tesla, BYD, LG, and all the rest for the foreseeable future, just not sure at what profit margin.

In comparison, Ford recalled 1.3 mil vehicles from 2014 to 2018 while selling 32.2 mil vehicles in the same time period. Fiat Chrysler also recalled 5.3 mil vehicles made between 2014 and 2018 while logging vehicle sales quantity of more than 400 mil over that period of time. Recall numbers as taken from [https://autoversed.com/the-biggest-automotive-recalls-of-the-past-decade/](https://autoversed.com/the-biggest-automotive-recalls-of-the-past-decade/).

post,k1qvku,,Key Takeaways from the Airbnb IPO filing,"Hi everyone,

I work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends and tech companies. I put this post together to share some key takeaways I had from looking at Airbnb's S-1 filing. If you found this post valuable and would like to read more please let me know. I'm thinking about writing like this more often if it's something people get value from. Thanks

On Monday November 16th, Airbnb filed to go public. While a target IPO price has not yet been set, Airbnb looks to be aiming to raise about $3 billion dollars at an analyst-estimated valuation of $30 billion. This is up from Airbnb's most recent valuation of $18.1 billion in April of this year when it raised a total of $2 billion in debt to cope with the Covid-19 crisis.

Airbnb is a remarkable company. What started in 2007 as 2 friends renting out airbeds in their apartment to attendees of a conference has, 13 years later, grown into a company operating in 220 countries with over 4 million hosts who have cumulatively earned over $110 billion. In 2019, there were 327 million nights and experiences booked on Airbnb. Nobody could have predicted those numbers in 2007. Airbnb has defined a brand new travel category and become a standard part of our vocabulary, much like Zoom. As they state in their S-1:

>*"" “Airbnb” has become synonymous with one-of-a-kind travel on a global scale.""*

But, while Airbnb is clearly a remarkable company, is it a good investment? That’s the question that this post aims to answer. Here are some key takeaways from an analysis of Airbnb’s recent S-1 filing:

(\****Note:*** *In case you’re wondering, an S-1 is the document that a companies files with the SEC when they plan to go public)*

1. Airbnb is a resilient business

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on Airbnb’s business. Gross booking value (GBV) in March was down 127%. Due to cancellations and alterations, Airbnb actually lost money on bookings in March.",10927,True,1606437131.0,2020-11-27 01:32:11,1607,375,tadhg8811,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/k1qvku/key_takeaways_from_the_airbnb_ipo_filing/,True,0.97,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,k2pk53,,"You've seen 40-80, now here's a comprehensive 60-100 mph list","I should note that these aren't ""true"" 60-100 mph tests. These results are taken from the 0-[end of run] tests from various car magazines. Typically, magazines will run three acceleration tests: 0-60, 0-100, and the quarter mile. All of these data points will come from the same run (or an average of a few runs). 

Thus, the 60-100 time is simply the time it takes to go from 60 mph to 100 mph *while already accelerating*. In my opinion, a ""true"" 60-100 test would have the car cruising at 60 mph in an optimal gear and then goosing it from there. 

Enjoy.

post,k6smc3,,A Semi-Drunk Business Related Question,"Hi guys, 

Am in the middle of watching a documentary and part of it covers a french guy in papua new guinea. This guy had a butchery, cafe and now more importantly has introduced the country to supermarkets and owns over 50% of them. My Question is why cant we being from a wealthier country simply provide some lower wealth nations with essential services which they require on day to day life such as water, supermarket/retail, infrastructure and create business doing that and gain wealth. The Congo for example is the biggest country by mass in Africa and has next to zero tarmac roads although gravel is coveted in the country, there is not a SINGLE company dedicated to using that to create much needed roads for example. What stops us from doing this and creating a company which their government would surely sign a contract and agree given that it is essential and no one else internally is doing it . 

Thinking about it if you save up some money here in the developed world (im from UK) and use that to buy cheaper things over there surely sumn like 100k would make u able to build a hq, ship parts and machinery, as well as employing locals.

Someone need to answer this question bc this french guy got minted from retail and i dont understand what factors would have stopped people previously from providing essential services to poorer nations to gain profit as well as improving their lives.

post,k9d7o2,,Chevy Bolt vs Nissan Leaf vs Rav4 prime vs ID.4 vs Tesla Model 3: winner: Model 3,"This is a **long** winding comparison of a number of electric drive cars. I'm writing it for those who don't want to go to the dealerships, rent cars from Chevy, Turo and borrow cars from friends etc like I have.

TLDR: I am an indecisive overly analytical person. I've been seriously considering the Chevy Bolt, Rav4 prime, ID.4 (only one I haven't driven) and the Tesla Model 3 and *I would consider a model Y if I had that kind of money*. Out of all of them I'm sure the Model 3 (SR or LR) is the best car for me (and many). Also I hate ""Tesla culture"" and fanboyism and don't like Elon. Still Tesla has extraordinary engineering.

First let me say this comparison is from the perspective of what car meets *my* wants and needs best. It is likely to differ from your own. If you need a *pure* point A to point B EV car that's reliable and **inexpensive I'd choose the Bolt EV, Kia Niro EV, or ID.4** for sure. I wouldn't park it in your garage though (more on that later). If the bolt EV had the supercharging speed/network I'd buy it in a heartbeat. My wants and needs however are an enjoyable driving experience, reducing my climate impact, and **getting passengers point A to point B as quickly** as possible (meaning without maintenance as well).

In addition to actually driving and trying to live with each car I've watched 100s of hours on youtube  car reviews, road trips, technology dives etc. I've watched reviews of the Kona EV, Niro EV, and others. I've read EPA documents, and have a literal graduate degree in materials science on battery technology, also working in the field. I've written a small simulation / calculation of travel time based on the cars EPA range, drag coefficients and charging profiles.

**Rav 4 Prime:**

I seriously wanted the Rav 4 prime. Power, Toyota reliability, and EV most of the time? It sounds amazing, my ""highway charge times"" would be 5 min (talk about fast fast charging!).

My takeaway, rating the Bolt, ID.4 or any other non-Tesla lower due to their charging network is not being fair to the vehicle. Tesla owns their supercharger network and has an incentive to ensure it works. 

None of the other manufacturers own a charging network. There's no reason to rate them lower for something they have no control over. That would be like rating any ICE vehicle based on a bad experience at a Shell station. 

Considering there are multiple charging networks and most will charge at home, I think you're giving too much weight to one issue with a single charger.",632,False,1607462664.0,2020-12-08 22:24:24,11,0,AtlantaSoulMan,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/k9d7o2/chevy_bolt_vs_nissan_leaf_vs_rav4_prime_vs_id4_vs/gf3go78/,True,,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,gf3go78

post,ka99a1,,Unintentionally hate my ICE vehicle after test driving a performance M3,"Tesla is my favorite company in multiple aspects. Their upbringing, mission, groundbreaking products... I just love them so much and have for a few years. 

I’m 20 years old and in college and currently drive a pickup truck that isn’t too speedy, but still can pass cars with a breeze. For the past couple of years I’ve been convincing my parents to purchase a Tesla and we’ve been on 2 test drives. (I was not the driver for either of these trips). 

Under GA law, for some reason I was under the impression that you had to be at least 25+ years of age to test drive a vehicle. After some curiosity, I called a local Tesla showroom and found out you only had to be 18. I shouted from the rooftops after hanging up the phone and immediately booked my test drive as soon as possible. 

A week later, after checking in for my appointment and getting settled, the employee said, “So you’re going to be driving the performance Model 3, I’m sure that’s okay with you?” “Absolutely”. I sat down in the drivers seat and was astonished even though I fully knew what to expect. Due to Covid, employees weren’t riding in the vehicle with you. Instead, they send you on your way for roughly 20 minutes to do your hearts desires. 

After driving for a few minutes and getting used to the braking system (which I absolutely loved) I approached a red light and I was the first car in line. When it turned green, I (safely) tested out the acceleration. I got a head rush, was thrown back in my seat and couldn’t hold back my laughter. I couldn’t believe how fast this machine that I was in charge of could go. I proceeded to get on the freeway and merge with no trouble at all as the acceleration gives you plenty of confidence to get in front of cars. I let autopilot take me a few miles and had it pass cars in lanes, I was smiling the entire time. Couldn’t stop myself no matter how hard I tried.

Without question one of the happiest moments of my life. I’ve had my model 3 since September. First and only car I’ve owned after driving 3 Ice cars to learn to drive. I am SO spoiled by what a great ride it is.

post,key7ub,,"Proposed Constitutional Challenge for excess EV re-registration fees: ie., in AL, AR, GA, IN, IL, MO, OH, WV, WY, etc.,.","**BACKGROUND**

Texas is considering implementing an EV re-registration fee to replace the revenue lost from gasoline taxes for roads and bridges.  The Texas SB-604 report has a nice break-down of how other states have dealt with the issue on page 35, and is [available here](https://d3eaozktcyljdh.cloudfront.net/cdn/ff/Xr9v-6fz2A5PionA1705nLQIp3cOoS8ZzMRmbAatXG8/1607100255/public/report-files/SB_604_AFV-Report_120120.pdf). Spoiler alert, based on the Texas analysis, the fee replacement should be approximately **$100** a year for EVs and **$80** for hybrids.

Of course, I'd heard about the $200 EV re-registration fees popping up here and there, and I always just thought, ""man, someone really ought to lobby against that..."" and yet, here we are.  There's a bunch of states that now have $150, $200 or more re-registration fees for EVs.

**LEGAL STANDARD**

When I was hearing about these fees in the abstract in other states where I don't live, I was regarding this as what is known as a [""political question""](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/political_question_doctrine) which essentially means, it's up to the legislative process, and courts shouldn't be involved because I was thinking of it as a [nonjusticiable issue](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/justiciability).

Basically, EV owners aren't a [protected class](https://content.next.westlaw.com/5-501-5857?transitionType=Default&contextData). It's a voluntary choice to own an EV -- so rational basis scrutiny applies to the legal examination of laws that disproportionately impact EV owners.

Then the car got totaled three months later... when replacing the vehicle, I had to pay the state ANOTHER $150 flat fee for the same calendar year for the replacement Model 3. Now I’m definitely in the negative.

To be clear, this $150 flat EV fee was on top of over $500 is annual taxes and registration fees the state imposes based on their assessed value of the vehicle. So that means, in 2020, I have paid close to $900 in registration and EV fees for a Model 3 SR+.

post,kgj5uo,,Can we talk about how BEHIND Canada is on EVs...,"I just wanted to start off by saying how disappointed in Canadians (honestly could apply to americans too, yet they still have better charging infrastructure and cost of vehicules).

I’d love to see if any other developped countries fare worst than Canada in a combination of these 3 factors:
1. Available EV to choose from
2. Charging Infrastructure 
3. Affordability

Here’s the 100% fully electric EVs available to the grand public:
-Hyundai Ioniq starting at 43 835$ 272km

-Hyundai Kona starting at 44 999$ 400km

-Nissan Leaf starting at 46 348$ 242km

-Kia soul starting at 44 505$ 348km

-Kia Niro starting at 46 905$ 385km

-Chevrolet Bolt starting at 47 953$ 400km

-Volkswagen egolf starting at 40 052$ Like 198km

-BMW i3 starting at 53 000$ Idk range but probably a joke for the price

-Tesla model 3 SR+ starting at 52 990$ 400km

-Other tesla models, Porsche, Audi, BMW, Volvo luxury vehicles that are unattainable for most average consumers.


Most of the vehicules offered above are eligible for a 5000$ federal incentive (after taxes). Other than that, only 2 provinces out of 10 have additional incentives (BC 5000$, QC 8000$). This goes to show how Canada cares, imo. 

Now, we could argue that even with rate conversions, prices are incredibly steep compared to Europe, by example, where a 2020 Peugeot costs 19000£ (33 000$) and has around 350km range. A 33 000$ car here with incentives could bring it to par with ICE vehicules.

Right now, the cheapest options have so little range for their price that no wonder canadians (I’d go as far as North Americans) have such a low adoption rates.

The only differences between US and Canada? Scarce charging infrastructure and ... winter. Canadian winters can reduce range up to 40%, on already low average range on available and the more affordable vehicules.

Maybe it’s just a rant, but I’m kind of frustrated that it’s not economically viable to own a brand new EV.",2214,True,1608421776.0,2020-12-20 00:49:36,22,48,jimmym007,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/kgj5uo/can_we_talk_about_how_behind_canada_is_on_evs/,True,0.83,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

COVID has permanently reduced my driving, and to save a little extra cash, I think I could accept a temporary 'downgrade'.

Australia. Comparing some models you've listed, driveaway prices with 1 CAD pretty much = 1 AUD:

- Kona electric is **$63-$71k** (£35-40k, €39-44k, US$48-54k

- Ioniq electric is $53-58k (£30-33k, €33-36k, US$40-44k)

- Tesla model 3 starts at $72k (£40k, €44k, US$55k)

- Nissan Leaf is $53k (£30k, €33k, US$40k)

- BMW i3 is $77k (£43k, €48k, US$59k)

For a bit of context, the petrol Kona starts at $27k, and a Toyota Camry at $29k, so we're being particularly shafted with EVs.

Kia EVs, the VW e-Golf, VW ID#, Peugeot e208, Renault Zoe etc aren't available here. Also there are no government incentives, and charging infrastructure is growing a bit but is still not amazing.

1. If you use your EV as a Daily Driver, and thus for your side hustle, has this made anything difficult for you?

4. Cleanliness - are you ever afraid that passengers, or food, may spill something harsh on your black / white leather seats?

Off grid, I had about 70% usable capacity with cool weather (within a few degrees above or below freezing at night). 

New inverters are IEEE1547 conformant (60.5Hz shut down) when commissioned for US/Canada, and Tesla can change the PW solar curtailment frequency to a more reasonable one so extended off-grid operation doesn't trip appliances.

post,knz82h,,Why the $TSLA bubble will not burst?,"A correction (\~-20%) can happen, but the bubble will not burst (where $TSLA loses more than 50%-90% of its value). Here's why:  

So a lot of people often use the dotcom bubble as a parallel to speculate the pop of the Tesla bubble. The most immediate comparisons come from names such as Amazon, which lost nearly 90% of its value from the peak of the bubble but was eventually able to gain back most of its shares. Other comparisons also include stocks such as Yahoo, which was actually added to the S&P 500 in 1999, right before the bubble burst, or even Qualcomm/Cisco. 

These speculations and comparisons are always interesting to think about. They come from deductions, aka where you extrapolate data points from the past in order to predict what is going to happen in the future. However, a deduction is often not the most useful mental model, especially when circumstances are different in the future. And this is one of those cases where the circumstances are actually very different. 

Now the basic argument of ""Tesla is not a car company"" is often overused. Yes, Tesla creates batteries, they are going into the autonomous market soon, their AutoPilot is one of the best AI that the world has today (stronger than NVIDIA's GPUs), they are going to get into the insurance game, they are going to get into the financing industry, some people might even say they are going to collaborate with Space X to create flying cars in 2050. That's all great. However, I'm actually going to argue that despite all of these things, Tesla's current price is overvalued but yet, the stock will not burst. And this has in large part to do with how the markets and trader psychology works today, and how different it is from 1999/2000:

As information and financial data has become more widely available through the internet, the markets have had a tendency to price things way ahead of it's time.",4498,True,1609452730.0,2020-12-31 23:12:10,16,281,BenDoverR8Now,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/knz82h/why_the_tsla_bubble_will_not_burst/,True,0.58,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

today I am sharing some due-diligence I recently did on $QS. QS has been a hot stock in recent months having made large moves, both up and down. They also entered the market as a SPAC and as they are intensely research-based, have no prior financials worth noting. So this dd post focuses on their innovation and their management and recent news. I hope you all enjoy it and look forward to any discussion!

**QUANTUMSCAPES DUE DILIGENCE (5th Jan)**

Intro to QS: "" QuantumScape Corp. engages in the provision of energy storage solutions. It focuses on the development of solid-state lithium-metal batteries for use in electric vehicles.

*First I checked their ratings and trend summary on* [*stockinvest.us*](https://stockinvest.us)*. Here is what I found:*

· Rated as sell on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) (changed to buy on the 6th Jan)

· Trending search for the day/week though (bullish - investor sentiment shows hype and interest)

* “QS Stock Risk:

This stock may move very much during a day (volatility) and with a very large prediction interval from the Bollinger Band this stock is considered to be ""very high risk"". During the last day, the stock moved **$13.60** between high and low, or **28.69%**. For the last week, the stock has had a daily average volatility of **17.36%**.

Our recommended stop-loss: **We hold a sell evaluation for this stock. No stop-loss set.""**

· Volume has increased on the 4th (of January) by 69 million shares but on falling prices.

· Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise **185.84%** during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between **$142.81** and **$406.18** at the end of this 3-month period.",15975,True,1610030019.0,2021-01-07 15:33:39,17,16,NathMcLovin,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kseeqq/quantumscape_corporations_due_diligence/,True,0.69,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

QS is very early in its infancy stage and apart from the amount of things that would have to go right for them, the other companies that are already in market have plans for better battery as well.

We are currently having a record level of downloads for the Signal app around the world. Between WhatsApp announcing they would be sharing everything with the Facebook mothership and the Apple privacy labels that allowed people to compare us to other popular messengers, it seems like many people are interested in private communication. 

Some quick facts about us: we are an open-sourced nonprofit organization whose mission is to bring private and secure communication to anyone and everyone. One of the reasons we opted for organizing as a nonprofit is that it aligned with our want to create a business model for a technology that wasn’t predicated on the need for personal data in any way. 

As an organization we work very hard to not know anything about you all. There aren’t analytics in the app, we use end to end encryption for everything from your messages and calls/video as well as all your metadata so we have no idea who you talk to or what you talk about.

We are very excited for all the interest and support, but are even more excited to hear from you all. 

We are online now and answering questions for at least the next 3 hours (in between a whole bunch of work stuff). If you are coming to this outside of the time-window don't worry please still leave a question, we will come back on Monday to answer more.

post,kv06or,,Could a wheel-driven car theoretically break the sound barrier? I did some calculations.,"I'm just thinking. Using the formula of force x velocity = power, I think I've figured out how much power the engine would require.

The force needed at that speed would be equal to drag (rolling resistance would be negligible since it's not dependent on speed), which is given by the drag equation. Let's assume a car with a drag coefficient and a frontal cross-section area of a Tesla Model S (the only car I could find this data for quickly).

* Air density is 1.225kg/m\^3
* Velocity is 330m/s
* Drag coefficient is 0.23 (but the drag coefficient is four times higher at Mach 1, so 0.23 x 4)
* Frontal cross-section area is 2.5m\^2

Using the drag equation, this gives about \~154,000 N of force. Multiplied by velocity, 330 m/s, gives us \~51,000,000 Watts (51MW) of power.

51MW \~= 68,000 horsepower. (Mind you, this would be the horsepower needed at the wheels).

I could be wrong about this next part, but seeing as internal combustion engines have a thermodynamic efficiency of 30-40%, I divided the answer by 0.3 to get the required crank horsepower. \~68,000hp/0.3 = \~226,300bhp.

On top of that, even if you could find an engine that could somehow fit in a Tesla while generating this much power, I don't see how you could actually apply that force to the ground. Rubber would obviously be shredded nearly instantly, and would likely disintegrate if you started slow and tried to accelerate to mach one. Plus, you'd need the ground to be cooperative, and I think dirt and asphalt would just break or fly up under the forces...

The problem is that Tesla didn't care about reliability or longitivity of their cars until recently.  So previous design decisions are rearing their heads, like screens that aren't sunproof and flash memory that was never provisioned in a way to last more than a few years.

I hate how The Verge described this inaccurately.  For the curious, I can provide some background because I work at a company that deals with flash memory a lot.  NAND chips (often called flash storage) hold electric charges in billions of cells across the chip. Those charges are the 1s and 0s that form your data. Just like all chips, defects will creep in during manufacture and cells will stop working.  To account for this, all chips use some form of redundancy so that data can be recovered.  But those dead cells are still unusable, reducing your effective storage.  To compensate, these chips are ""provisioned"".  A flash controller with a chip that can hold 70 GB could only offer 64 GB to the system.  The remaining 6 GB are spare cells that the memory controller can use as replacements for dead cells.",2923,True,1610610340.0,2021-01-14 08:45:40,776,0,andrewia,cars,https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/kwvv6x/tesla_asked_to_recall_158000_model_s_and_model_x/gj7huti/,True,,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,gj7huti

 Tesla has taken delivery of a massive “Giga Press,” which is believed to be the world’s largest casting machine, at Gigafactory Texas.

## Tesla is literally going big on casing

In recent years, Tesla has been focusing on casting technology to produce larger parts of its vehicles in bigger pieces.

We recently reported that Tesla is now producing [the Model Y with one giant rear-underbody ](https://electrek.co/2021/01/11/tesla-starts-production-model-y-massive-single-piece-rear-casting/)that used to be made of 70 parts.

That’s possible due to [Tesla’s first press, which was installed at the Fremont factory](https://electrek.co/2020/09/09/tesla-casting-machine-new-parts-laying-outside-drone-flyover/) and put in operation last year. The machine, nicknamed Giga Press, is the first of its kind and is produced by Idra Group in Italy. It has a clamping force of 55,000 to 61,000 kilonewtons (5,600 to 6,200 tf).

Tesla has introduced another [of those massive machines at Fremont factory in September](https://electrek.co/2020/09/09/tesla-deploying-second-giga-press-machine-fremont-factory/).

Tesla has reportedly ordered many of those machines to deploy at new factories, and now we see one coming to Texas.

New Tesla Giga Press in Texas

Jeff Roberts did a drone flyover of the Tesla Gigafactory Texas near Austin today and spotted Tesla unloading several massive containers from Idra:

[https://youtu.be/tNv\_log3NQU](https://youtu.be/tNv_log3NQU)

The new Giga Press arrives as Tesla is starting to make a lot of progress on its new factory under construction with several structures taking shape over the last few months.

Construction started in July 2020, and [the automaker plans to achieve “first completion” in May 2021](https://electrek.",2457,True,1611343005.0,2021-01-22 20:16:45,6,0,RScottyL,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/l2us6e/tesla_takes_delivery_of_massive_giga_press_at/,True,0.75,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Source: https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/01/waymo-ceo-tesla-is-not-a-competitor-at-all/

> Many Tesla fans view the electric carmaker as a world leader in self-driving technology. CEO Elon Musk himself has repeatedly claimed that the company is less than two years away from perfecting fully self-driving technology.

> But in an interview with Germany's Manager magazine, Waymo CEO John Krafcik dismissed Tesla as a Waymo competitor and argued that Tesla's current strategy was unlikely to ever produce a fully self-driving system.

> ""For us, Tesla is not a competitor at all,"" Krafcik said. ""We manufacture a completely autonomous driving system. Tesla is an automaker that is developing a really good driver assistance system.""

> For Musk, these two technologies exist along a continuum. His plan is to gradually make Tesla's Autopilot software better until it's good enough to work with no human supervision. But Krafcik argues that's not realistic.

> ""It is a misconception that you can just keep developing a driver assistance system until one day you can magically leap to a fully autonomous driving system,"" Krafcik said. ""In terms of robustness and accuracy, for example, our sensors are orders of magnitude better than what we see on the road from other manufacturers.""

> This isn't a new argument.

> **Tesla keeps missing Musk's predictions**

> Tesla has a lot riding on its efforts to develop fully self-driving technology. Since 2016, Tesla has been selling cars with a suite of cameras, radar, and other hardware that it has touted as ready for full self-driving with a future software update.

post,l5jq8t,,Don't sleep on Lordstown Motors - $RIDE,"Its CEO is Steve Burns, founder of and has a close relationship with fellow American EV company, Workhorse $WKHS. Is an EV company in the United States. Has the ex-director of Tesla. Has the third largest gigafactory in the United States, having taken the reigns of the abandoned Lordstown, Ohio plant GM left to rot just a few years ago. Their main slice of pie is the Lordstown Endurance, an EV pickup truck that already has working prototypes. Press has included having the Endurance parked at the White House and the Endurance being driven by a guy from CNBC. They plan to bring the Endurance to market by end of year/early next year.


The Endurance as of this post has no direct competitor. Its an EV pickup truck marketed to the working class man. Its priced at $52,500 offering 250 mile gas range, tow capability of 6,000lbs. Pre-orders booked at 100,000 as of January 12.

The factory is in full working shape. The company isn't fucking around and fluffing investors. They stated their mission, showed a proof of concept and got to work.

This also brings a story to sell the news on of a destitute American town that GM abandoned and time forgot, being saved by new hard working jobs, crafting top of the line American-made pickup trucks.


This last point gets more bullish with Biden's recent executive order and how much he's proven to be invested in the future of EV. Upon taking a look at the government fleet of vehicles he intends on replacing with EV's, a sizeable portion are pickup trucks. Even disregarding this, the mission is clear to have an EV manufacturer for the USPS. And I'll say this one more time - THERE IS NO DIRECT COMPETITOR TO THE ENDURANCE.

Say what you will about the Cybertruck but its just not a proper candidate for the Endurance's demographic. The Hummer EV is priced at $90k. Ford's at least another year away from the F150 EV.

post,l7hlft,,Are We Experiencing The End of Value Investing?,"Historically, value investing has reigned supreme. We all praise the likes of Benjamin Graham (author of the Intelligent Investor),  Warren Buffett (CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and adamant proponent of value investing), financial modeling, and financial experts like those behind hedge funds. However, after the most recent GameStop short squeeze, our traditional methods for evaluating and purchasing stocks have been threatened. If one of the following: AMC, Nokia, BlackBerry, and Bed Bath and Beyond stocks short squeeze over the weekend, our traditional beloved value investing will be on its way to becoming obsolete. Even currently, when we think of companies that we should invest in we are told the usual tech company: Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Tesla, and others, when all of them are overvalued. Elon Musk this past summer tweeted that his company, Tesla’s shares were overvalued. Even Apple stock can be considered overvalued, it’s market cap of $2.036T is roughly $350 billion higher than the next two largest tech companies, Amazon and Microsoft (~$1.7T) and until recently (like yesterday) it has not had the sales growth to account for or reflect this market cap. Investors have gotten more optimistic about Apple in the past year, and this exuberance is what allows the stock to continue rising. Even the hedge funds and big tech companies succumb to sentimental investing. I have once said not to “gamble” on stocks and to use only your mind when you make an investment, but that is what we have been conditioned to say. While it has worked out for me and many others, we must not disregard the sentimental value a company holds, or a group of individuals interested in pouring money in the same stock (like Wall Street Bets).",1759,False,1611890169.0,2021-01-29 04:16:09,1,3,Sharp_Profit7321,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/l7hlft/are_we_experiencing_the_end_of_value_investing/,True,1.0,2021,both,search,False,False,0,

comment,l7qlfh,l7qlfh,,"Yeah... So I've found a pretty massive wrench in everyone's thesis.

The short interest results that were posted 1/27 were actually settled 1/15. There has been enough volatility in the past 2 weeks for shorts to easily close out without anyone noticing. If that's true, it would make sense for them (or anyone) to short again while above 300, especially if they knew the original 61 million shorts were already cleared.

People also keep saying ""Days to Cover is still 2.5!"" Yeah, that doesn't mean anything in a volatile market like this. Days to Cover, aka Short Interest, is a function of (Shares Shorted) / (Avg Volume). Avg volume is over the past 30 days. The first 15 of the past 30 days saw much lower volume. Current Short Ratio is closer to 0.5-1. If they could cover their entire positions in 1 day (causing a spike obviously), who's to say they didn't clear over a 10 day period (causing the spikes we saw), then, knowing they lost $4 billion (if cleared around the $62 price range, which I suspect), why not take out new short positions around $300? The price can't go up any more if there's no short squeeze coming.

Just my 2 cents. I get downvoted for this on WSB, so it's apparent no one wants to objectively discuss this very real possibility.

post,lae3d4,,"New to investing; trying to make sense of Tesla, and general question about P/E","Hi all,

I'm fairly new to investing. I'm reading some recommended materials; reading A Random Walk Through Wall Street and listening to The Intelligent Investor. I've started trying to read through some earnings reports to learn a bit about the space and how to do my own research.

Some stocks of interest to me are the auto stocks; Toyota and Tesla to be precise.

My understanding is that the P/E is the price over earnings. This number doesn't seem to be handed out per stock. Some seem to automatically calculate it? How is this done? For instance if I google ""Tesla stock"" I get the P/E value of 1318. 

If I google ATT (T) I don't get a P/E value, which I assume means I need to calculate it myself from their earnings reports?

Also, playing with the numbers and trying to figure out how Tesla (a $730B market cap company) stands up next to Toyota (A $227B market cap company) I came up with the following:

    $835 / earnings = 1318.42
    earnings = $835/1318, which would be $0.63 per share (TSLA)

This is interesting to me. Because if we do the same for Toyota:

    $140.49 / earnings = 14.56
    earnings = $140.49 / 14.56 = $9.65 earnings per share (TM)

More interestingly, if I try and apply the PE of TSLA to Toyota, I get the following:

    1318 = price / $9.65 earnings per share
    1318 * $9.65 = price
    price = $12718.7

This would bring Toyota's market cap to $20.6T, which I think we probably all agree would be ridiculous?

The more interesting thing is I took Toyota's P/E and applied it to TSLA

    14.56 = price / $0.63 earnings per share
    price = $9.17

This would bring Tesla's market cap to $8.7B if my math is right. 

I guess the point of my post is to ask, what gives? Are PE values in excess of 1000 for large-cap companies ever justified? Speculatively, is this sustainable? Who is this value coming from?",4281,True,1612213466.0,2021-02-01 22:04:26,93,205,QuarksAreUnbreakable,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lae3d4/new_to_investing_trying_to_make_sense_of_tesla/,True,0.9,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Tesla isn't being judged on today's profits but what people think its profits will be in the future, while Toyota is judged on today's profits. 

Most people think Tesla will increase its market share by significant amounts. Tesla currently sells less then 1% of world wide cars. In 2035, what will be Tesla's market share? Will it ""just"" increase 1000% to 10%? Will EVs become the most dominate type of car and Tesla's EV market share is 81% in the US currently could it have that type of market share world wide for all cars? 

By investing in Tesla are investors going to get some backdoor profits from SpaceX? SpaceX is not a publicly traded company even though lots of people want to invest in it and some see investing in Tesla as the next best thing. 

Do you think Tesla full self driving is going to be the dominant self driving company or will that go to Waymo? Or will there be multiple self driving companies that are all roughly the same?

Lastly do you think that Tesla has a moat around battery technology? The same way that no other company can touch Google in search because they gained a technology lead then continued to invest in it. Now pretty much no other company really tries and rivers Google search. Maybe Tesla batteries will be the same.

comment,lb3u4l,lb3u4l,,">Tesla Model S and Model X units built between 2012 and 2018 are known to have a debilitating issue with the media control unit (MCU). The memory used in the system has a finite amount of write cycles and the system constantly logs tons of data on the memory. So the car eventually exceeds the designed limit for write cycles, which can cause write and read errors as the car's memory effectively freezes certain bits. That can lead to glitches, restarts, and total failure of the central touch screen as the system becomes unable to use its own internal memory. **And while many cars have common failure points, this is notable because the design makes this eventuality certain for all affected cars.**

So literally every single Model S and X from 2012-2018 will eventually have this fail.

It's a pretty easy fix going forward; just have that unit be replaceable, and put it down as like a 200k scheduled maintenance.

post,lc0rzo,,Drone Delivery Canada * $TAKOF * DD [10X UPSIDE],"Drone Delivery Canada Corp. is a drone technology company focused on the design, development, and implementation of its proprietary logistics software platform, using drones. The Company’s platform will be used as a Software as a Service (SaaS) model for government and corporate organizations globally

&#x200B;

Drone tech is really hot sector right now and I feel this is immensely under valued. I am not going to make this post a long one, rather I will just list things good about this company.

&#x200B;

* As I mentioned earlier drone industry is hot atm, look at UAVS, ALPP or BANT
* As part of the Company's technology roadmap, it plans to integrate various aspects of AI into its solution, including the use of AI in leveraging.
* Relaxed regulations for drone parcel delivery to take effect in March!
* The Company has created one of the healthiest balance sheets I've seen in a long time
* Included in 'OTC Markets Group Announces the 2021 OTCQX Best 50' awards.
* Currently trading around $1.1
* Todays volume has been a record.
* $0 DEBT!
* $20 million dollars in the bank.
* WSS has a price target of $6.5
* Undervalued 77%!

&#x200B;

The list really goes on and on I will list all the refs for relevant info for you to look at, but one of the major news recently is that:

* **The Company is in discussions with various Federal and Provincial Government agencies and Canadian logistics providers and is hopeful to commercially participate with its advanced, patented drone delivery as the vaccine distribution plans start to roll out across Canada, and potentially internationally.**

I personally think this is HUGE!

CONS:

* Earnings have declined by 39.6% per year over past 5 years.
* Makes less than USD$1m in revenue (CA$63K).

post,lcftzc,,10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.

post,ling8b,,"Why Cathie Wood might be right, and why TSLA is actually STILL fairly or even undervalued at these levels.","""Analysts have been calling the stock “overvalued” since the day they went public, because they all keep comparing it to other car companies. I wish I had a dollar for every analyst who pointed out how “*every other car company sells ten times as many cars*”. 

 I’ve also repeatedly bumped into some lazy analysis that Tesla is expensive because its current P/E is 1,270x or forward P/E is 204x. However, I’ve hardly ever seen a Tesla bear put out a detailed valuation in support of their bearish thesis which makes me wonder if a lot of people are simply dismissing Tesla in arrogance.

But the thing is, they’re all making the same mistake:

**Tesla isn’t a car company.**

They’re an energy and technology and SaaS company that makes cars.

Once you realize what Tesla really is, you start to see what their place in the market is going to be in the years to come.

They acquired Grohmann Engineering. They acquired Perbox. They acquired Maxwell Technologies and Hibar Systems. And of course everyone remembers the Solar City acquisition back before dropping Motors from their name. They didn’t acquire these companies because they thought they were cool. They did it so nobody else could.

* There are 25,000 EV charging stations in the United States. 20,000 of them are owned by Tesla.
* Tesla is currently the #1 li-ion battery manufacturer in America, and #5 in the world.
* Tesla has secured the rights to large supplies of lithium, and has developed their own internal process for extracting lithium deposits inexpensively from other sources.

These segments of the energy space — battery production and EV charging — are a market sector that’s going to grow 50 fold in the next 15 years as consumer demand for EV’s increases. All of the major auto manufacturers have declared they’re shifting towards electric cars.

Where are they going to get the batteries? How are their customers going to charge them?

comment,ling8b,ling8b,,"\> **Tesla isn’t a car company.**

Will this meme ever die? They sell cars. Everything else people pitch them as  selling is just speculation or a business you'd 100% expect a 21st century car company to be in. You think Toyota isn't working on battery tech? You think GM isn't working on self-driving? You think Fiat doesn't provide software for vehicles? Yet, would you call these companies anything other than a car companies? Everything else with Tesla is a glorified side-hustle.

Oh, their an energy company? Ok... so, where's their big move into this space? What justifies the price? How much US energy infrastructure is built atop Tesla tech? What's been planned, and what's been executed, and what's the competition? All these questions just get a big shrug and a ""well, they make batteries"". On that note:

&#x200B;

\> Where are they going to get the batteries? How are their customers going to charge them?

\> The answer: Tesla.

\> Musk has made it clear from the beginning that their intent is to supply batteries for the entire EV *industry*

I think this sums up one angle the Tesla hype in a nutshell. It's the weird assumption Tesla has a monopoly on this and that, and always will. They don't, they never have, and they never will. It's like valuating an ice-cream company based on the total consumption of ice-cream in the world. If batteries are a profitable business, you're going to get a lot more people entering the space.

post,lkytt1,,It seems as that we can expect the next Gigafactory to be in Russia.,"Just saw this mentioned and it gives see hope, Tesla is considering a russian expansion.

Russia is still an almost white spot for Tesla. There is of course a strong Tesla community, but it is small.

Right now, there is for example no map data in Russia for Tesla cars. Not good when you pass the border from the EU and the map screens turns blank. (Elon, please help. Get it changed in the software, so that we can drive to other countries from the EU.)

There are of course almost no superchargers in Russia and Kazakhstan. But there are a few, thanks Tesla !

(a set of 4 Superchargers in the Moscow area and in KZ in Nur Sultan 6x and Almaty 4x)

Kazakhstan is a differen country, but belongs to the russian economic region of 4 countries.

There is a russian law, that **every** ! gas station must have a electric charging possibility. But might be only a 220V outlet. So this is a good beginning.

So what could it be, they want to talk about. Hyundai for example has a car production in Russia and there are other car plants as well in Russia. Hyundai is producing a lot of cars there and the brand is very popular in Russia.

After India, this would be the right place to start a new factory. The new factory could be in Sankt Petersburg or somewhere else.

post,llg0ke,,17 Investment Principles from Warren Buffett and the late Benjamin Graham,"While many may argue that value investing doesn't make sense anymore, a lot of the rules and investment principles from Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham stand the test of time, especially when you apply current nuance to their original investment rules (which are now close to a century-old)...

**Disclaimer:** The views below represent the opinions of the OP and are supported by research from Benjamin Graham's Security Analysis from 1934 and The Intelligent Investor from 1949, along with Google and Yahoo Finance and public statements from Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham. These investment principles do not constitute investment advice, but rather are general principles one might employ in reaching his or her overall financial goals. *All* investing bears risk, including possible loss of capital.

**#1 Create a healthy balance in your portfolio between risky and less risky investments**

*“Furthermore, a truly conservative investor will be satisfied with the gains shown on half his portfolio in a rising market, while in a severe decline he may derive much solace from reflecting how much better off he is than many of his more venturesome friends.” – quote from Benjamin Graham*

A conservative investor may have 50% of his or her portfolio in risky assets like stocks and real estate and 50% in less risky investments like US treasury bonds (which you can buy either directly from the US Treasury or through ETFs like Charles Schwab Short Term Treasuries ETF (Ticker: SCHO) as well as through investments in gold (SPDR Gold Trust (Ticker: GLD)) which tends to be a good portfolio hedge against volatile markets and inflation (at least historically).

Benjamin Graham’s formula for calculating the percentage of assets that should be in risky vs. less-risky investments is to subtract your age from 100 and invest that percentage of your assets in risky investments (like stocks), with the rest in relatively safer assets like cash and gold.",34921,True,1613516365.0,2021-02-16 23:59:25,1810,169,henry_gindt,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/llg0ke/17_investment_principles_from_warren_buffett_and/,True,0.98,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

1. My DD Research and Why Ehang Technologies  

   1. January 29th, 2021 ($EH - $66.36) - EHang receives $40M investment from Carmignac. Carmignac is a French [asset management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management) firm founded in 1989. What is important to note is that they one of the largest funds in all of Europe with $35 billion under management. And furthermore their flagship fund the Carmignac Patrimoine was one of the few funds during the volatility of 2008-2011 that outperformed their peers. I would imagine being one of the premier benchmarked asset management firms in Europe that their DD would have been successfully completed. Any omissions or errors would have been an immediate disapproval. While there has been some cases of bad investment made by firms, it is on the whole a lot rarer.

This. You don't need to be chasing those +20% annual returns. While not being a measure of future performance, since it's inception in 1993 SPY has seen 10% annual returns. And that's with the dotcom bubble and recession wiping out large percentages. To put that in perspective, if you were to invest $500 per month ($6k per year) into a fund that returns 10% annually, you'll be looking at nearly $1,000,000 after 30 years while only having invested $180,000.

Only way that it becomes a problem is if you're retiring soon and will need the money right away when there is a market correction. But there are some easy ways to mitigate that risk. You can semi-retire to help cover living expenses (so you don't have to cash out during the correction) or you can cash out some of those gains as you near retirement to build up a buffer in case there is a downturn.",1004,False,1613574098.0,2021-02-17 16:01:38,2,0,[deleted],stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/llg0ke/17_investment_principles_from_warren_buffett_and/gnrqa03/,True,,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,gnrqa03

post,ln7btg,,Potential Silver and Silver Miner Moonshot,"Short DD, feel free to comment.

Tailwinds:

\- Commodity vs gold ratio has started to crunch down signaling commodity boom (copper, lumber, tin, oil, NG, even uranium). Silver, though considered a partial monetary metal, is only going to see increased demand from batteries, solar, EV, medical equipment from here on out. I believe one Tesla Roadster uses something like 1-3 kg of silver. Historical average gold to silver ratio is 40. We are at 66 ish. Mining ratio is 8:1, even lower.

\- Natural elasticity built up from COMEX futures suppression. This is a long topic in itself, but the silver price along with gold price has been ""managed"" for years, with banks like JPM being fined millions of dollars for spoofing (creating massive sells using paper futures triggering cascade of sell stops during thin volume trading hours). However as supply becomes tighter the COMEX is increasingly being used as a method for private family offices, mints, industrials, and hedgefunds to take delivery. The situation is quite dire IMO after the recent ""silversqueeze"" movement- Currently there are about 700 million ounces worth of open contract, with 4 days until March delivery. This number is historically high, and even a small percentage of these contracts standing for delivery (i.e by mints and ETF etc who are feeling the demand) would lead to price volatility.

\- Monetary metal. Due to its extreme utility it can be considered the Etherium or theta to gold, but it is nevertheless still store of value, even though it is not a tier I asset for central banks yet. While gold experiences short term head wind due to rising bond yields, a FED yield curve control policy would dramatically increase tail winds for gold. If history serves, gold and silver have a deep connection and a true commodities bull market is often marked by high gold prices. 

\- Unlike gold, silver has no direct competitor, perceived or actual.

I had been one of those sceptics who thought Tesla was in a bubble and would eventually return to around $500-600. However I must admit after lots of research Tesla does seem to be 5 years ahead of other EV makers and i’ve been waiting ever since to see a price drop.

post,lv4gkp,,Startups in 13 sentence - Paul Graham," 

Paul Graham wrote an essay in 2009, ""Startups in 13 sentences""

It's filled with nuggets of startup wisdom like:

""It's better to make a few people really happy than to make a lot of people semi-happy.""

A summary of an already short-essay:

**1. Pick good cofounders.**

Cofounders are for a startup what location is for real estate.

You can change anything about a house except where it is.

In a startup, you can change your idea easily, but changing your cofounders is hard.

**2. Launch fast.**

The reason to launch fast is not so much that it's critical to get your product to market early, but that you haven't really started working on it till you've launched.

Launching teaches you what you should have been building.

**3. Let your idea evolve.**

This is the second half of launching fast. Launch fast and iterate.

It's a big mistake to treat a startup as if it were merely a matter of implementing some brilliant initial idea.

As in an essay, most of the ideas appear in the implementation.

**4. Understand your users.**

You can envision the wealth created by a startup as a rectangle, where one side is the number of users and the other is how much you improve their lives.

The second dimension is the one you have the most control over.

The growth in the first will be driven by how well you do in the second.

The hard part is seeing something new that users lack. The better you understand them the better the odds of doing that.

That's why so many successful startups make something the founders needed

**5. Better to make a few users love you than a lot ambivalent.**

Ideally, you want to make large numbers of users love you, but you can't expect to hit that right away.

Initially, you have to choose between satisfying all the needs of a subset of potential users, or satisfying a subset of the needs of all potential users.

Take the first. It's easier to expand user-wise than satisfaction.

And perhaps more importantly, it's harder to lie to yourself.",6076,True,1614589339.0,2021-03-01 10:02:19,1,0,karen_vardanian,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/lv4gkp/startups_in_13_sentence_paul_graham/,True,1.0,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,m01wde,,The Best 2021 Volvo S60 is Underpriced,"Here’s the scenario: you’re interested in getting a compact luxury sports sedan, and you’re thinking about treating yourself to something that’s really quite nice. The usual Teutonic names come into play here: Mercedes, Audi, BMW, along with some others: Tesla, Genesis, etc. And then you think about looking into Volvo’s offerings - which you end up getting, because it’s so terribly mispriced compared to the competition.

Here’s a bunch of MSRPs (which, I know, isn’t what people will actually pay at the dealer, but nonetheless is a solid benchmark) for mostly-comparably-equipped sedans: all wheel drive, a heads-up display, automated parking, traffic-aware cruise control, a sunroof, and whatever free seats/paint color/wheels were available. You might have different preferences than I do, so the numbers might vary person-to-person.

* Volvo’s S60 Recharge Inscription is basically the best S60 you can buy. It comes standard with basically everything, to the point where the only option worth adding (at least, for someone living in Texas) is the $200 automatic parking feature. MSRP + Destination comes out to $51,895, for a 400-horsepower plug-in hybrid with AWD. It also comes with a tax credit of $5,419, making the “actual” price $46,476 (for those who qualify, and I assume most people buying these kinds of products qualify).
* Genesis’ G70 3.3T AWD came to $49,225. It lacked the heads-up display, but was otherwise well-equipped and easily one of the higher-value plays available.
* Tesla’s Model 3 Long Range AWD was $47,190. There aren’t many options available, but it’s easily the most tech-focused product, which causes some polarization among shoppers.
* Audi’s A4 Prestige 45 TFSI quattro S tronic (what a mouthful!) also comes equipped well without having to select options, so it tips the scales at $50,845. The A4 has 261 HP, so about 35% less power to show off four rings.

Volvo is also much less of a ""sporty"" brand than Audi/BMW/Merc.  

You might say ""Ah, but these are luxury cars, people buying them don't care about sportiness.""  But I think that mindset is outdated as the sedan market has shifted.

The people who don't care about sportiness are buying SUVs and CUVs these days.  Sedans are less popular than ever, so percentage-wise the remaining buyers like sportiness.  Toyota recognizes this- it's why they've made a conscious effort to make the Camry more engaging.

H2O Innovations Inc HEO.V - This is an upcoming company with solid financials that is sort of treading new ground. Their stock just took a dip and is starting to recover. With the need for clean water and company foundations, I'd expect this stock to hover around $5 a share when things get back to normal.

Cineplex Inc [CGX.TO](https://cgx.to/) \- Everyone seems to be going crazy for AMC right now, along with the Gamestop situation.

The new rail line can support deliveries of raw materials.  Page 4-11 states, "" Demand for copper in vehicles is expected to increase by 1,700 kilotons by 2027. Tesla operates their “Gigafactory”, a lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle subassembly factory in Sparks. Nevada has the only mine producing lithium in the U.S., called the “Lithium Hub”, located near the Tesla Gigafactory facility. ""

Finished goods to Fremont would benefit.

The Fremont facility already has adjacent rail, and a routing for a new 2.5-mile spur to connect the Gigafactory to rail has been identified. This one project would enable the elimination of 36,400 truck trips a year on I-80 through Sparks, Reno, and northern California. ""

post,m3qh7u,,Canadian Tire and NuPort Robotics to Commercialize Canada’s First Automated Heavy Duty Trucking Technology,"Canadian National retailer Canadian Tire Corporation and Toronto based start-up NuPort Robotics Inc., Canada's first autonomous trucking company, have announced a partnership with the Ontario government to invest $3 million to undertake an automated heavy duty trucking project to test a first-of-its-kind-in-the-world technology.

The breakthrough technology provides a transportation solution for the middle mile, the short-haul shuttle runs that semi-tractor trailers make between distribution centres, warehouses and terminals each day. It is designed to enable next-generation automated trucks that are more fuel efficient, safer to operate, and provide an enhanced driver experience.

Backed by $1 million in support from the Ontario government through Ontario's Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network (AVIN) and matched by $1 million investments from Canadian Tire and NuPort Robotics, respectively, the two-year project is applying proprietary, artificial intelligence (AI) technology from NuPort Robotics to retrofit two conventional semi-tractor trailers - which will always be attended by a driver - with high-tech sensors and controls, a touchscreen navigation system, and other advanced features such as obstacle and collision avoidance.

""Ontario is proud to be a global leader in automated and connected vehicle technology and this innovative project is an exciting milestone toward automated vehicle tech in the trucking industry,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-16-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Stock futures mixed after Dow, S&P 500 closed at record highs again

> * U.S. stock futures were mixed Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 little changed after they both closed again at record highs to start the week. Nasdaq futures rose Tuesday, adding to Monday’s 1.1% gain, which moved the tech-heavy index to just 4.5% away from last month’s record high close.

> * Stocks were able to shake off the 10-year Treasury yield holding around 1.6% on Monday and Tuesday, after hitting an over one-year high of 1.642% on Friday. Rapidly rising bond yields have recently been a drag on growth stocks as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and compress market valuations.

*****

> # 2. Fed to begin March meeting with polices under scrutiny

> * The Federal Reserve, which begins its two-day March meeting Tuesday, will be watching bond yields and the latest reading on retail sales. Economists expect the government’s February data to show a 0.4% increase in retail sales following a 5.3% surge in January. With the Fed’s extraordinarily easy monetary measures during Covid under scrutiny, the nation’s central bank is set to release new economic and interest rate forecasts along with its policy statement Wednesday afternoon.

post,metref,,[$BB] The size of the real-world driving datasets that Blackberry IVY has access to will be so much bigger than Tesla's,"A huge reason for Tesla's insane valuation is the fact that Tesla has amassed 3 billion miles of real-world Autopilot data (by comparison, Waymo only has 20 million real-world miles and 10 billion simulation miles). This allows Tesla to be the only automotive company currently that can train vision-based self-driving system in the real world at such a huge scale. Essentially, Tesla is utilizing its users as free labor to train its self-driving system by having the users correct the system whenever it makes a wrong turn.

Blackberry IVY will very soon change the game. By creating a standard data abstraction layer on the 175 million QNX-powered vehicles (and possibly more since IVY is OS-agnostic and will support other non-QNX vehicles), Blackberry IVY will likely become the de-facto industry standard for automakers to share normalized sensor data (camera, radar, lidar, steering wheel rotation, brakes, acceleration etc.) with Autonomous Vehicle software makers (Waymo, Cruise, Argo, Motional, Aurora, TuSimple, Baidu, Pony.AI, Momenta etc.).

By 'sharing', I mean monetizing. De-identified vehicle sensor and localization data will be the most important asset that automakers can monetize in the immediate short term. Blackberry and AWS will be the bridge between the traditional automotive world and the software world by creating programming standards, interface and data marketplaces.

Just imagine this, Tesla only has **<2 million** vehicles on the road currently and they are already called a Big Data company and world-leading ""self-driving car"" company (debatable, I personally think anything under L4 autonomy is ADAS, not self-driving).

post,mg91ws,,Tesla and Toyota Are Considering Jointly Developing a Small Electric SUV Platform,"Choi Won-seok reports in the Korean Ghosun Libo news publication that according to an official from the Japanese automotive industry Toyota and Tesla have been reviewing the partnership since last year and are approaching the final stage.

Here are some of the highlights of Toyota Tesla partnership. When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV EV at low cost using the Toyota platform.

The Ghosun IIbo is the biggest newspaper in SK. A Tesla source Sawyer Merritt, tweets that he has been told ""the reporter of the story is also highly regarded. We'll see if it's true.""

Toyota provides the vehicle platform to Tesla, and instead, Tesla provides some of the electronic control platform and software technology installed in its vehicle to Toyota.

When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV electric vehicle at low cost using the Toyota platform. In addition, Tesla's sales in Japan, which are around 1,000 units per year, are likely to increase significantly.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said at the 'Battery Day' in September of last year, that Tesla ""will release a $25,000 compact and affordable electric car in 2023. However, among experts, there were several opinions that it would be difficult for Tesla to find a way to sell electric cars at such low prices. Especially considering Tesla has already developed the Model 3 in 2017, The model electric crossover in 2020, the exoskeleton of the Cybertruck and working on the Semi truck. at this moment we have no idea about Tesla's affordable compact vehicle, which now it looks like may be produced in partnership with Toyota, if this report is true.

I think this is a smart move for both Tesla and Toyota. Some people may be skeptical of a Tesla Toyota partnership, but remember that Tesla helped built Toyota RAV4 in 2012. I am sure you guys remember when Toyota sold its Tesla stocks in 2017.

**Abstract:** Elon Musk's company is calling for priority approval for energy transition projects in Germany. Also because of bad experiences with the Gigafactory. By Thorsten Metzner .

Six months before the federal election, the Tesla Group led by Elon Musk is calling for a fundamental reform of the licensing law in Germany - with priority given to sustainable energy transition projects. This is the conclusion of an incendiary letter from Tesla, which is available to this newspaper, and which is also justified by the concrete experiences with the Gigafactory for Berlin-Brandenburg (GFBB) in Grünheide, Brandenburg, which was launched in November 2019 and has not yet been approved.

The plant is actually scheduled to start production in July 2021. ""Tesla Brandenburg has experienced first-hand that obstacles in German licensing law slow down the necessary industrial transformation and thus the transport and energy turnaround,"" the official letter says.

* Following 500,000 miles of development testing, Ford embarked on a  110,000-mile “Mother of All Road Trips” across the United States and  Canada to prove out BlueCruise hands-free highway driving technology in a  wide range of driving and weather conditions
* 2021 Ford F-150 and 2021 Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with the available Ford Co-Pilot360™ Active 2.0 Prep Package can receive BlueCruise later this year through over-the-air software update.    
 
* BlueCruise will give drivers the comfort and confidence of  hands-free driving on prequalified sections of divided highways called  Hands-Free Blue Zones that make up more than 100,000 miles of North  American roads  
 
* Additional Ford vehicles to receive BlueCruise technology in coming  years as Ford continues to add additional highways and deliver new  hands-free driving capabilities to F-150, Mustang Mach-E and more

**DEARBORN, Mich., April 14, 2021** – Ford will begin offering its  new BlueCruise hands-free highway driving system to customers later  this year after 500,000 miles of development testing and fine-tuning the  technology on a journey across the United States and Canada.

Last year, Ford sent a fleet of 10 test vehicles – five F-150 pickups  and five all-electric Mustang Mach-E SUVs – to complete what test  drivers dubbed the “Mother of All Road Trips.” The trek covered more  than 110,000 miles through 37 states and five Canadian provinces to  challenge BlueCruise against a wide range of road, weather and traffic  conditions.

post,mr23nw,,My attempt at EBITDA forecast valuation for Tesla (TSLA),"So I've tried to estimate the 10-year return for holding TSLA shares by projecting growth, margins and EBITDA forward in three scenarios and coming up with an estimated enterprise value and market cap for TSLA in 2030. Hoping to hear some helpful feedback.

Quick disclaimer: I am not a CFA, I don't have a degree in finance (degree in engineering) and this is my first time trying to do this. Obviously don't take this as investment advice.

For the base case scenario, I used analyst estimates for revenue growth in 2021-2023 and then grew it at the rate closer to the projected EV market growth between now and 2027 (22%). I then grew it at 20% for the last 3 years to be conservative. So this is a scenario in which Tesla captures more market share for a few years and then maintains that market share. For EBITDA Margin, I maintained it at 20% until 2026 at which point I let it decline by 1 percentage point a year as I'd expect there to be more competition and Tesla to be selling less luxury cars (higher margin) as a percentage of their sales. 

My base case EBITDA projection for 2030 was then 48.45 Billion USD. For a company that is still growing revenues at 20% albeit without high margins, I gave it a EV/EBITDA multiple of 25, resulting in an enterprise value and market cap of 1.2 Trillion dollars. This represents a 1.66x multiple over 10 years on the original investment.

For the bull/optimistic case, I kept the margin at 20% for the next 10 years and kept the growth rate above the 22% market rate for the next 10 years, meaning Tesla is able to maintain their higher than industry margins, perhaps through leasing autopilot software and continues to gain market share. This gave me an 2030 EBITDA of 77.26 Billion USD.

**What is Coinbase?**

* Founded in 2012, Coinbase is mainly known as a company that allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies regardless if you’re an everyday investor or a hedge fund
* The company serves 43 million retail users, 7,000 institutions like hedge funds, and 115,000 ecosystem partners in over 100 countries
* **On the retail side,** Coinbase’s main products are its mobile app which has a super easy to use interface and then there’s Coinbase Pro which is more for advanced traders
* **On the business side,** Coinbase also offers a lot of really interesting services, including trading for institutions, listing assets on Coinbase which probably comes at a high cost, enabling businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments, cryptocurrency custody which just means helping institutions store crypto assets securely, and a venture capital arm that invests in crypto startups
* **Main point:** Coinbase is much more than just a place to trade crypto and the company is creating an ecosystem where different parts of the business feed off each other to make the entire platform stronger

**The Coinbase Business Model**

* To understand where Coinbase sees its business going, it’s important to first go over some context about the crypto market in general

post,mudcnh,,What would happen to an electric car in a major pile up?,"Reading about the Tesla crash that required thousands of gallons of water to put out and the 100+ car pile up in Dallas in February has got me wondering. If an electric car was to be caught in a multi-car pile up, how would it fare compared to gas cars? I know electric cars are really good in crash tests, but that's only in one accident. What happens if the vehicle's structure is already compromised and then you get an 18-wheeler barreling into it at over 60 mph smashing it into everything else? If Trey McDaniel was in a Model X or Mach E and it got ejected into the next lane over, that seems like a best case scenario should it burst into flames. How will you get enough water to drown the batteries and keep them from reigniting if the car is now in the middle of the group (assuming fire fighters can get to the scene early and close enough)? As electric car adoption goes up, what happens when there's multiple electric cars caught in an accident?",958,False,1618874547.0,2021-04-20 01:22:27,1,16,theotherjazen,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/mudcnh/what_would_happen_to_an_electric_car_in_a_major/,True,0.55,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,
comment,mudcnh,mudcnh,,"The problem with the Tesla crash is that battery fires can get hot enough to decompose water, turning it into hydrogen and oxygen. They can also start metal fires.

An EV fire in a large pileup would easily ignite the other cars, turning a simple mass of twisted metal and minor injuries into a large, uncontrollable, fire.

Even if there isn't a fire, other vehicles may become electrically charged if there is damage to the electrical system.

In 2013, the DoE (under Obama) stated ""In areas where a suitable water source is not present and  there are no threats to life safety or to nearby structures, vehicles, or other  combustibles, allowing the battery pack to burn to self-extinguishment may  be a viable alternative to suppression."".

I'm based in NZ and use Hatch Invest.

Right now I own a mish mash of stocks, ranging from Apple to Sony to Baba, to VACQ.

I'd like to set my portfolio on somewhat autopilot, with 10-20% for speculative plays (I want to keep my VACQ for eg). I'm bullish on certain plays, and I enjoy the personal picks aspect.

I'm only a few thousand into investing so far, and only put in a couple hundred a month, so now seems like the ideal time to rebalance before moving forward.

So I'm looking at one of the following options, and would love suggestions or reasoning on ratios and combinations:

Option 1:
40% VOO
20% VXF
20% VXUS
20% personal picks

Option 2:

I would bet this is not related to any government permission delay or problems in construction.

It is related with the new batteries. Since the new batteries are not yet ready it doesn't make sense to push the factory. Tesla will use the extra 6 months to built the battery factory so all pieces will be in place in order to produce a German made Tesla.

No. Just no. Cameras on the driver isn't going to make their systems ""safer"" or more ""useful"".

For all the situations that FSD is advertised to be used in, and many that it isn't, their systems do an A+ job at both piloting the vehicle and alerting the driver to take over when the AI isn't confident what to do.

Auto-Steer and Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, often referred to together as Autopilot, can't drive _everywhere_, but the number situations they can handle extremely well is impressive. Freeways have been a solved problem for Tesla for years. Lane changes, also solved for freeways and city streets. Stop signs, street lights, construction zones, speed limit signs, all solved with vision -- the car will come to a complete stop at a stop sign without intervention, or would slow down and alert the driver when entering a construction zone. Even roads with poor or no lane markings are handled quite well. If the car isn't confident, it prompts the driver to take over. It's a PHENOMENAL system.

Only uniformed people who hear ""Autopilot"" and jump to the conclusion that it should be able to take you from A to B without intervention complain. Nobody is claiming that it does that.

The accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Equities.  If you add up everything that belongs in the asset section of the balance sheet the total MUST equal the sum of everything in the liabilities and equities sections.  

If our business is a farm, the assets are the farm land, the barn, the tractors, and the crops.  The liabilities are the mortgage and the workers pay that they earned last week, but the farm has paid yet.  The equity is the cash the farmer used to buy the farm and the profit that the farmer has not paid to himself.  

Under normal circumstances, the crops are sold.  This reduces the crop asset, but increases the cash asset.  Hopefully we sold the crops for more than their value on the balance sheet and turned a profit. That means the cash asset increases more than the crop asset decreases.  The difference is added to retained earnings, which is part of the equities section.  We are still in balance.

 Then, we pay the mortgage and the workers.  The cash asset is reduced and the mortgage and worker pay liabilities are reduced.

post,nrj6n5,,Would Tesla ever consider acquiring Ford?,"Disclosure: I own Ford stock

Years ago I bought Ford as a value play, back then it appeared undervalued and had a solid dividend for the sector. I feel like Fords F-150 alone is enough to justify owning the stock. Then the pandemic happened, then the chip shortage happened and I have remained patient. 

Now that patience has been rewarded, I keep looking at TSLA and F and wonder why they don't get together. With Ford's diverse product lineup, aggressive move into the EV market and projections of profitability, I think they represent a significant value.

BTW, in those ten years, despite having both ICE and EV components, I've never had a major repair, just fluids and tires.

The other news is TSLA opens for business in China. Not sure that is good news for the US but since when does Musk give a shite about America. 

That's probably where where 5x trading volume and $100million dump into TSLA came from today. The Chinese.

Expect the price to decay back to trend over next trading week.

post,o6z52n,,Helped my mother finally get her dream Ford Mustang. (Mach-E),"(Apologies for the long-winded story.)

My mom has been a consistent four door sedan owner for the entirety of my life and has been very anti-SUV/crossover.  There were more Ford Tauruses in her ownership history than either of us could remember.  Her last sedan was a 2016 Volvo S60, and she enjoyed that well enough, but she often complained about how low it was.  With age starting to get to her knees, she started talking a lot more about SUVs and ease of entry/exit in the last few years, and especially in the last few months.

We started looking seriously at things in the past month or so.  She was really keen on the idea of a plug-in hybrid, but unfortunately the market where we live is virtually non-existent.  I don't think there's really been a PHEV sold regularly here since the Volt (which I had), and never a small SUV/crossover.  I looked around and pretty much everything came up 250-500 or more miles away, just way outside the feasible range for her to look at.  There was one random Rav4 Prime around that I don't know why or how a dealer here has it, but they also had it marked up $6k, so it was out.  She liked the idea of a full BEV as well, but it still made her a bit nervous, despite being around them for about 6 years between the Teslas my brother, and I have owned.  The Model Y was out of her price range by about $10k, give or take, and she never was fully comfortable with the interfaces and such in our Teslas, so I just knew it wouldn't be a good fit for her anyway.  It seemed like either a plain hybrid or the standard ICE variant of something like an Escape or CR-V was probably going to be in her future just due to what we could find.

However, my dad and I did have one other electric option left we were pursuing in our search for her, availability was just a huge issue.  I had talked to her about the Mach-E a lot from when it was first announced, because I knew it would be right up her alley.",7717,True,1624534798.0,2021-06-24 13:39:58,43,35,Algeradd,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/o6z52n/helped_my_mother_finally_get_her_dream_ford/,True,0.69,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,ohoh4i,,The Physics of 0-60 mph in 2 Seconds (Model S Plaid),"I was looking into the physics of the Tesla Model S Plaid's performance numbers in response to the [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/o1vziw/tesla_model_s_plaid_first_test_060_mph_in_198/) and [debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/mdz8t8/tesla_is_lying_the_model_s_plaid_wont_be_able_to/) going on in r/cars but I thought you all would find this insightful too. Tesla's claims of 0-60 mph in 1.99 seconds, 1/4 mile in 9.23s @ 155 mph are all very impressive and seemingly defying the laws of physics. No worries though, I built a physics-based model for performance EVs, plugged in the Model S Plaid, and confirmed the universe is still in order.

Let's start with some interesting takeaways from the model first and I'll go into detail on the physics and how it was built later on.

# Model S Plaid is built for 0-60 in 2 seconds

Modern EV motors all have a similarly shaped power curve that have a constant torque region (lower speeds) and a constant power region (higher speeds). **Peak acceleration occurs in the constant torque region** and acceleration is constant until you hit the ""corner speed"" and transition into the constant power region where torque drops off.

The power curve of the Model S Plaid has just the right shape (and peak power/torque) to reach 60 mph in 2 seconds (excluding a 1ft rollout). As evidence, the **Model S Plaid has a corner speed of exactly 60 mph** (ie. 1050 ft-lb is 1020 hp at a vehicle speed of 60 mph). This allows it to pull a constant \~1.25 g's all the way up to 60 mph, which falls off immediately after ([plot](https://imgur.com/14Jz5NP)).

To get to 60 mph even faster, the Model S Plaid would need to have even more torque (and probably more traction). Just **having more power wouldn't yield 0-60 improvements as the Model S Plaid** **is already in its constant torque region all the way up to 60 mph**.",11872,True,1625943067.0,2021-07-10 20:51:07,10,16,jayqwu,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/ohoh4i/the_physics_of_060_mph_in_2_seconds_model_s_plaid/,True,0.59,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,opz2fg,,"The Upcoming Electric Horsepower Wars (AKA, why 2,000+ horsepower is easy)","Let  just get the obvious out of the way. Electric cars are EASY to build.  Like, stupid easy, at least compared to ICE cars. Why? Moving parts and  fluid dynamics are a bitch (think engines, air/fuel systems,  transmissions). These issues are mostly bypassed by going electric. Need  more power; get a bigger battery and/or have it discharge more.  Electric motors are a joke to build compared to ICE engines. Electric  cars (mostly) have a single gear, so you don't need a super complex 8  speed automatic that's super difficult to build and is pretty fragile  compared to a single reduction gear. These are the basic differences.  The downside, for now, is that batteries are heavy and cost too much,  something that will be drastically reduced in the near future with more  R&D, economies of scale, and government incentives.

Now,  because electric cars are easy to build, you will see a crap ton of new  car manufactures spring up (think Tesla and Rimac). The old car  companies could easily crush them if they wanted, but they won't. Why?  Vested interest. They spent way too much money on existing ICE cars to  suddenly just scrap their factories and start fresh, so instead they  will SLOWLY transition to the electric car age, to please their  stockholders, which are notoriously risk-adverse. Anyway, where am I  going with this? Electric cars are easy, at least their drivetrains are.  Fit and finish, luxury options, high-tech options are hard to do, and  require long logistics chains as well as R&D. This is why Teslas are  crap when it comes to luxury or techy options, compared to a Mercedes  or Audi. So, how do you sell an electric car for 100k that has crap  range, few options and features and handles like crap because it weights  69 tons? You make it quick (not fast).

If you want to continue the discussion in this thread, I suggest sorting by new. 

Posted below on Saturday.

This sub has been very quiet about discussing Tesla lately it seems. Just getting a status update on what everyone thinks may happen this quarter and in the future.

Just to throw some possibilities around, here are some discussion points. 

What do you expect this quarter? Will it be enough to push Tesla back above $700?

Will having Bitcoin on the balance sheet have an effect on their quarter? It's dropped some but not that much. It will be  slightly negative this quarter, but could bounce back again if Bitcoin runs again.

How do you think the stock will react if Tesla rolls out Full self driving that can drive people to work? The new subscription model is out, so FSDAAS is now an option, how does that effect their revenue next quarter and long term? How soon do you think FSD rolls out to wide release? It's already looking very impressive, but still needs some fine tuning. Will it be v10 or v11 that is capable? Is the processor enough to handle level 4 driving? What will be needed for level 5 FSD? 

How soon will the Austin and Berlin plants open up to production? Are they duplicating problem solving of the 4680 Model Y line between Texas and Germany? Who is farther along? Is Berlin almost ready to go and just delayed by permit processes? Will the new factories be covered in solar panels?

What is the going forward plans for letting other auto manufacturers use the Tesla charging network? Elon just mentioned Tesla will allow other EV's to use their network. Will all new chargers be pass through with 300kwh charging? That will be needed for the cybertruck. How big will their charging network need to grow, and how will that effect their revenue?",4147,True,1627142161.0,2021-07-24 17:56:01,332,479,rideincircles,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oqsosi/what_do_you_expect_for_tslas_2nd_quarter_update/,True,0.88,2021,both,search,False,False,0,

post,os7kvx,,Tesla 2021 Q2 earnings report,"Tesla 2021 Q2 Earnings Report

Earnings: $1.45 vs. $0.98 per share expected
Revenue: $11.98 vs. $11.30 billion expected
Free cash flow: 619 million vs. -319 million expected
 
Cash
 • Operating cash flow less capex (free cash flow) of $619M in Q2
 • Net debt and finance lease repayments of $1.6B in Q2
 • In total, $912M decrease in our cash and cash equivalents in Q2 to $16.2B
Profitability
 • $1.3B GAAP operating income; 11.0% operating margin in Q2
 • $1.1B GAAP net income; $1.6B non-GAAP net income (ex-SBC1) in Q2
 • 28.4% GAAP Automotive gross margin (25.8% ex-credits) in Q2
Operations
 • Record vehicle production and deliveries in Q2
 • Successful launch of FSD subscription in July
 • Started delivering the new Model S to customers
 
Summary
In the second quarter of 2021, we broke new and notable records. We produced and delivered over 200,000 vehicles, achieved an operating margin of 11.0% and exceeded $1B of GAAP net income for the first time in our history.
Supply chain challenges, in particular global semiconductor shortages and port congestion, continued to be present in Q2. The Tesla team, including supply chain, software development and our factories, worked extremely hard to keep production running as close to full capacity as possible. With global vehicle demand at record levels, component supply will have a strong influence on the rate of our delivery growth for the rest of this year.
We successfully launched Tesla Vision in Q2, which was mainly possible due to our ability to use data from over a million Tesla vehicles to source a large, diverse and accurate dataset. Solving full autonomy is a difficult engineering challenge in which we continue to believe can only be solved through the collection of large, real-world datasets and cuttingedge AI.

post,oy3v9z,,Tesla AI day scheduled for August 19th.,"With AI Day approaching in a few weeks, Tesla has started sending out invitations to the highly-anticipated event. Tesla’s invitations, including the wording in its RSVP page, suggest that the company may be discussing some interesting topics for AI Day. 

Immediately noticeable in the AI Day invites is an image showing what seems to be a [**stack of computer hardware**](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-dojo-chip-images-dennis-hong/). Very little is known about this yet-to-be-announced hardware, though it was initially teased by legendary mechanical engineer Dennis Hong online. This fueled speculations that the image was likely related to Tesla’s Dojo Supercomputer, which would be used to train Autopilot software. 

A look at the RSVP page for the event shows a rather interesting description of the upcoming event. 

*“Join us in Palo Alto, CA on August 19, 2021, at 5 p.m. PDT. This invite-only event will feature a keynote by Elon, hardware and software demos from Tesla engineers, test rides in Model S Plaid, and more. Attendees will be among the first to see our latest developments in supercomputing and neural network training. They’ll also get an inside look at what’s next for AI at Tesla beyond our vehicle fleet.*

*“If you have received an email invitation for this event, please submit the form below using the same email address to let us know you’d like to attend. Space is limited, and we will be confirming the attendee list closer to the event date. If you are chosen to attend AI Day, you will receive an email confirmation with additional event details.”*

Arguably the most noticeable portion from AI Day’s RSVP page is the sentence referencing what is “next for AI at Tesla beyond our vehicle fleet.” Granted, Tesla is also using its software prowess for its energy products with products like Autobidder, but Elon Musk has also noted in the past that long term, people would likely think of Tesla as an [**AI robotics company**](https://www.thestreet.",2610,True,1628115734.0,2021-08-05 00:22:14,20,11,redmars1234,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oy3v9z/tesla_ai_day_scheduled_for_august_19th/,True,0.7,2021,both,search,False,False,0,

Gapping DOWN:

* DLTR

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking at a somewhat mixed open after we saw the indices push for new ATH to end last week's trading. Berkshire Hathaway reported better-than-expected profit growth for Q2. Tesla delayed cybertruck production until 2022, but the stock is up this morning on a price target upgrade. China has been reacting to various COVID outbreaks, and I fear the US could see more strict measures in the near future as well. This is worth following closely, as any lockdowns or countermeasures could be detrimental to stocks in the short-term, particularly the reopening plays. 

SPY is trading a bit under 442, and we could see some indecision this morning after hitting fresh ATH on Friday. DIA and QQQ are in similar technical levels after hitting fresh ATH in Friday's trading as well. I think we could be in for some choppiness, I'll be keeping an eye on UVXY if we do see some weakness. If we see strength and a push back towards ATH, then the strength should continue. Gold and silver are down a bit this morning, while crude oil is down considerably this morning. This is worth following closely, as crude oil is up quite a bit year-to-date and could see this as a correction.

Stocks finished mixed, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) remarkably recovering losses early in the session to narrowly eke out a new intraday record high despite massive geopolitical concerns and disappointing economic data coming out of China. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also recovered to finish roughly even while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, was down 0.75% at the time of writing.

China released economic data for July that showed growth rates slow down dramatically as the world’s second largest economy battles with summer flooding and the resurgence of coronavirus thanks to the highly contagious delta variant. Industrial production, a gauge of activity in the manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors, grew by 6.4% year-over-year in July, a sharp deceleration from the 8.3% rise in June and below the 7.9% growth expected. Retail sales, a key measurement of consumer sentiment in the world’s most populous nation, grew by 8.5% in July, way below the 12.1% increase in June and missing the 11.5% expected by economists.

The National Bureau of Statistics noted “the impact of multiple factors including the growing external uncertainties and the domestic COVID-19 epidemic and flooding situation,” according to a release. The bureau added that the “economic recovery is still unstable and uneven.”

post,p5ul1o,,A driver died in a car crash involving a Nio car activated with driver-assistance feature,"Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO were weak Monday after a fatal accident involving a NIO car with self-driving features.  


The fatal crash of a NIO ES8 sport-utility vehicle took place last week in China. The SUV is equipped with several driver assistance functions, including features enabled by Intel (ticker: INTC) division Mobileye, that enable some forms of autonomous driving. NIO’s driver assistance functions are called NIO Pilot and employ cameras as the so-called eyes of the car.  


NIO has other autonomous-driving technology, referred to as NAD, such as radar, lidar—a laser-based radar—and camera vision, as well as computing power provided partly by Nvidia (NVDA) to process all the data points coming at the car.  


The NAD features don’t appear to be available on all NIO vehicles, including the ES8. All autonomous driving systems require the driver to pay attention to the road at all times.  


NIO responded to a request for comment with a Weibo post in Chinese. The post indicates the company is cooperating with police regarding the investigation.  


The global automotive industry is still wrestling with regulatory and branding issues surrounding autonomous technology. Self-driving features, such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assistance, make driving safer as long as systems are used as intended. But drivers might rely too much on the features when systems are dubbed pilot or autopilot. Government safety regulators, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, are still drafting plans to prepare for the introduction of more advanced self-driving features.

Beijing issued the newest implementation plan for Hydrogen Energy Industry development; Auto companies export volume has a YoY increase of 1.2 times; China Evergrande Vice-Chairman Xia Haijun has sold 3 million Evergrande shares; Autonomous driving problems are still being heated.

**Industry News**

On August 16, the Beijing Bureau of economy and information technology formally issued a notice on the ""Beijing Hydrogen Energy Industry Development Implementation Plan (2021-2025)"".

The implementation plan specifies how the hydrogen energy industry in Beijing will develop over the next five years from multiple perspectives.

In addition, according to CAAM statistical analysis, in July 2021, the export volume of auto companies hit a record high, of **which the contribution of new energy auto exports to growth was 31.5%.**

In July 2021, auto companies exported 174,000 vehicles, an MoM increase of 9.8% and a YoY increase of 1.8 times. From January to July 2021, auto companies exported 1.002 million vehicles, a YoY increase of 1.2 times, surpassing the entire year of last year.

Looking ahead, Citigroup said that it is optimistic about the strong fundamentals of the new energy vehicle industry. It is expected that the sales of new energy vehicles in August will increase by 8% month-by-month, or 164% YoY, reaching 266,000; BYD (1211.HK) and Geely (0175.HK) are the two companies with the highest penetration rate of new energy vehicles in the next two years.",4475,True,1629269303.0,2021-08-18 08:48:23,2,2,jiagzh7732,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p6lw3c/chinese_ev_daily_baidu_unveils_first_robocar/,True,0.58,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Stocks rose today, recovering some of the losses from earlier this week as market participants shake off some taper concerns. Market participants continue to weigh several factors affecting the market, including but not limited to (1) the taper timeline, (2) record-breaking corporate earnings, (3) and surging coronavirus delta variant infections. 

The S&P 500 (SPY) rose 0.79% today, recovering earlier losses, but finished the week 0.31% down. The Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.04% today and staged a remarkable comeback this week, coming from 2% down Thursday to finishing 0.01% higher. The Dow Jones (DIA) rose 0.65% today but finished the week 0.96% down, underperforming the other two major indexes. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, rose 1.68% today but finished the week 1.98% down.

On Wednesday, meeting minutes suggested members of the Federal Reserve were advancing the debate over the timing and scope of tapering the pace of the pandemic-era asset purchasing program. In the latest minutes, the Fed said, “looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.”As I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed’s goal has not yet been reached.

post,phiruh,,"Tesla further delays Cybertruck timeline to late 2022, Roadster delayed until 2023","The Tesla Cybertruck delay was already a known fact, but CEO Elon Musk's latest reported comments add a few more details to the picture. Citing sources familiar with the meeting, Electrek reported Thursday that Musk held a company-wide call and said the Cybertruck should be ready for production in late 2022.

If the company plans for beta trucks later this year, that leaves nowhere near enough time to start actual production in late 2021.

Following his comments, Tesla updated the Cybertruck's reservation page to note production will fire up in 2022. Though, according to Musk, we're not looking at early 2022 or anything like that. And as we suspected, the CEO underscored the electric truck's volume models may not be ready until sometime in 2023. If Tesla follows this timeline, we'll get the priciest tri-motor model in 2022, then the dual- and single-motor trucks in 2023.

Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla has delayed the new Roadster program to 2023, and even then, that’s only going to happen with a big “if.”  
The new electric hypercar is now three years behind its original timeline.  
When first unveiling the next-generation Tesla Roadster in 2017, Musk said that it will come to market in 2020.

Tesla started taking reservations for the impressive electric supercar with a 0-60 mph in 1.9 seconds and over 600 miles of range at the unveiling event.  
People who wanted to be first in line to get the vehicle had to put down between $50,000 and $250,000 in deposits.  
The vehicle program was later delayed, as the CEO said that it wasn’t a priority for Tesla.

post,pk1q6p,,Model Y- 1 year review,"I've had my 2020 Tesla Model Y for almost 1 year, picked it up mid September 2020 and I've put 11,250 miles on it. I figured some of y'all may be interested in hearing my thoughts. 

Let's start with the bad about the Model Y. First, the suspension. The Model Y is a very firm vehicle, it's not like a cushion or a pillow ride like some air suspension vehicles have. My friend has a Q8, which is way better than my Model Y. Another bad is the road-trip ability/charging. The supercharger network is praised upon by many people transitioning to Tesla vehicles but in my experience, it's been a mixed bag. I never felt like I would run out of range and always made it to my destination/supercharger with at least 10% battery. Supercharging is annoying. I made a trip to Houston and back in my Model Y and there are 3 charging stops along the way. The way it's mapped you have 2 options. If you stop at the first charger (Corsicana TX) you would have to stop at the 3rd Charger (Huntsville TX) otherwise you wouldn't make it. You may be thinking ok just go to the charger in the middle and have one-stop. That's even worse because Tesla only put 4 stalls at that location. On the way to Houston, I had 4 cars AHEAD of me. I waited 30 min just to get a spot, it was fine 25 min and I'd be on my way. I was kinda annoyed because a trip that takes 4 hrs 30 took close to 5 and a half hours pretty much. On the way back I figured I'd go to the outer two chargers, guess what happened, another wait, at both. The first one was a 15-minute wait then a 10-minute charge. The second one was a 10-minute wait with a 10 min charge. I guess a pro of taking the Tesla vs my Lexus was the charging was free, I got 2,000 free supercharging miles when I bought my vehicle. The big topic with Tesla though is Build quality. Oh boy, build quality is very inconsistent with Tesla. Originally I had a VIN for my vehicle which I was supposed to take delivery mid-august.",6058,True,1631068411.0,2021-09-08 04:33:31,85,61,PangolinEffective,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/pk1q6p/model_y_1_year_review/,True,0.77,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

The Model 3 will still do calls, read/reply to messages, and has Bluetooth, Spotify, and whatever streaming service Tesla uses. - Its largest downside imo is iPhone integration for Apple Music is very subpar compared to CarPlay, but it’s not as though it doesn’t work, and even with having CarPlay now I don’t see it as a giant advantage.

Tesla says that drivers should be paying attention at all times so that they have an easier pathway to get approved.

It's a much lower bar, they don't have to prove their software is bug-free, they only have to show that the driver can override the autopilot in an emergency. 

It also means they can never be held accountable for accidents. Any accident caused by the autopilot is actually the fault of the driver for not paying attention. If the driver was paying attention, then the accident would have happened with or without the autopilot.

post,pupybk,,"Desperate need of help! Rat got in my car, Tesla and independent shops don't want to help.","So for the last couple of days I have been beating my brains out trying to resolve this issue.

Vehicle: 2021 Tesla Model Y

A couple of days ago, a rat somehow got into my car.  I am guessing that it got into my backpack at work then got into the car after.  I noticed rat droppings and urine in the trunk area the following day.  In the evening while at work, I sat in my car to see if I could hear any rustling, which I did.  I tried looking for it but it would hide in an area I don't have easy access to.

I went ahead and bought several traps, both traditional clamps and glue traps plus bait; however, they have been unsuccessful.

Last night, I sat in my car again to see if I could hear it but I could not.   This worries me now because I don't know if it escaped the vehicle or if it's dead somewhere in the car where I can't find it.

I contacted Tesla to see if they would be able to inspect the crevices and panels but they said they consider this to be a hazmat issue so they refused to do it.

I contacted my insurance to make a comprehensive claim and they referred me to local body shops.  I had to filter through these body shops to make sure they are Tesla certified; however, every single place I called said that they won't deal with a rat infestation and that I should contact Tesla directly, which I already did.

I went ahead and made a claim with my insurance but I am worried that they won't be able to find a Tesla-certified body shop that would do this kind of work to begin with.

So between having a rat driving partner and the lack of available services, I am really stressed out.

post,pxjrmb,,What makes a Minivan a Minivan?,"I've been wondering for a while what makes a car a minivan and thus undesirable by pretty much everyone, so I would like to hear from the community what a car needs to be classified as a minivan instead of as a large crossover?


Some of my own thoughts:
At first I figured it was ground clearance, which holds some water, but it's not very definitive. 

Minivans:
Kia Carnival: 6.8""
Chrysler Pacifica AWD: 5.4""
Toyota Sienna/Woodland Edition: 6.4""/7""

Random samples of Midsize Crossovers:
Honda CR-V: 7.8""
Mazda CX-5: 7.5""
Tesla Model Y: 6.6""

Subcompact Crossovers:
Toyota C-HR: 5.9""
Kia Seltos: 7.3""
VW Taos: 6.6""

It doesn't seem to be that big of a difference. Maybe 1-2"" on average.


Is it the sliding doors? The [first gen odyssey](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/HondaOdyssey-001.jpg) and the [Mercedes R Class](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/2010_Mercedes-Benz_R350L_Grand_Edition_CDi_Automatic_3.0_Front.jpg) had normal rear doors and most still consider them as minivans.


Is it the styling? The new [Kia Carnival] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Kia_Carnival_KA4_red_diplomatic_%281%29_%28cropped%29.jpg) is obviously trying to buck that, but I haven't heard much of it working. I think most people still believe it to be a minivan.


Is it the front wheel drive based platforms? Both the Sienna and Pacifica now come as AWD variants and most crossovers are front wheel drive based as well. The Mercedes R class was even available as rear wheel drive.


With the rise of captains chairs in SUVs I don't think it's that either.


So I'm stumped and now ask you, r/cars, what makes a vehicle a minivan to you, instead of a long crossover?",1713,False,1632875359.0,2021-09-29 02:29:19,0,33,RazingsIsNotHomeNow,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/pxjrmb/what_makes_a_minivan_a_minivan/,True,0.27,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,py7bkp,,How Elon thinks - a distillation of his worldview,"Note: This is not a news piece but a distillation of many hours of listening to Elon. For those of us who've done it, it's hard to not admire his worldview, how he deconstructs the world around him to turn chaos into opportunities. I hope it's relevant to the community. Happy to delete it, if not. This is my attempt to find little snippets that give a glimpse into how his mind works :)

**We think in decades, Elon thinks in civilizations**

Take any argument on climate change and people talk about how it is going to impact our lives decades from now. We can barely see a few hundred years into the future. Here’s Elon talking about building a sustainable energy future that will be good for a billion years.

>We've essentially designed civilization to be super sensitive to climate change. The important thing to appreciate is that we are going to exit the fossil fuels era because at a certain point we will simply run out of carbon to mine and burn. So the question is really when do we exit this era, not if. The goal is to exit the era as quickly as possible. That means we need to move from the old goal, the pre-industrial goal, which was to move from chopping down forests and killing lots of whales to fossil fuels, which actually in that context was a good thing. But the new goal is to move to a sustainable energy future. We want to use energy sources that will be good for a billion years. The best case is simply delaying that inevitable transition to sustainable energy. The worst case is more displacement and destruction than all the wars in history combined. This is why I call it (burning fossils) the dumbest experiment in history. Why would you do this? The issue we have right now is that the rules fundamentally favor the bad outcome.

Recent History: In July, Tesla reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings results, signaling that the company’s business is strong.

Recent Developments: A global chip shortage has hurt the auto industry. Last week, CEO Elon Musk said that the shortage will be “short term” and things will get better in 2022.

High Hopes: Investor Cathie Wood recently set a stock target of $3,000 per share for Tesla, and added that she would trim her stake in the company if it reaches that level.

Not a Value: Tesla’s price-to-earning’s ratio is over 400, which means this is definitely not a value stock. Still, this hasn’t stopped hoards of investors from backing the popular company.

Final Thoughts: Investing in Tesla is more than just about your outlook for the EV industry; it’s also about how you view Musk.

So they employ a rule that is permitted to anyone, but they are given “too much leeway”?  I would argue that it is a rule not even a loop hole.  It seems very clearly laid out - you can build early with the risk of having to pay to have it torn down, or you can wait.  But it is not like they bribed someone to do this.  It is a legal option but rarely exercised by German firms.

post,q5wo4j,,"My favourite quote from the Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future book!","
“There was little the mainstream auto industry could do to slow Tesla down. But that didn't stop executives from trying to be difficult whenever possible. Tesla, for example, wanted to call its third-generation car the Model E, so that its lineup of vehicles would be the Model S, E and X - another playful Musk gag. But Ford's then CEO, Alan Mulally, blocked Tesla from using Model E, with the threat of a lawsuit. ""So I call up Mulally and I was like, 'Alan, are you just fucking with us or are you really going to do a Model E?'"" Musk said. ""And I'm not sure which is worse. You know? Like it would actually make more sense if they're just fucking with us because if they actually come out with a Model E at this point, and we've got the Model S and the X and Ford comes out with a Model E, it's going to look ridiculous. So even though Ford did the Model T a hundred years ago, nobody thinks of 'Model' as being a Ford thing anymore. So it would just feel like they stole it. Like why did you going stealing Tesla's E? Like you're some sort of fascist army marching across the alphabet, some sort of Sesame Street robber. And he was like, 'No, no, we're definitely going to use it.' And I was like, 'Oh, I don't think that's such a good idea because people are going to be confused because it's not gong to make sense. People aren't used to Ford having Model something these days. It's usually called like the Ford Fusion.' And he was like, no, his guys really want to use that. That's terrible."" After that, Tesla registered the trademark for Model Y as another joke. ""In fact, Ford called us up deadpan and said, 'We see you've registered Model Y. Is that what you're gong to use instead of the Model E?'"" Musk said. ""I'm like, 'No, it's a joke. S-E-X-Y. What does that spell?' But trademark law is a dry profession it turns out.”

    i think this is indicative of a larger problem. look at all three industries tesla,
     tesla energy, and spacex represent. take spacex. making rockets cheaper and 
    reusable didn't take any technological breakthrough, just the intelligent insight 
    of someone conversant with both the engineering and the financial issues. the 
    actual expenditure to cover spacex development to the stage of reusability was 
    small when compared to nasa budgets, and nasa could have accomplished this same 
    innovation 30 years ago. why didn't it happen? institutional inertia, political 
    corruption, financial managers making engineering decisions. same story with tesla
     and tesla energy.
    
    we are a country filled with brilliant individuals, that is run by incompetent 
    and corrupt fools, and we are paying the price for it in multi-trillion dollars 
    losses in opportunity cost.
    
    take climate change as another example. take 1 trillion dollars, a drop in the 
    bucket on a global scale, build 20 gigafactories, the supporting battery 
    factories, and the supporting mining factories, and in three years you are
     producing 10 million tesla m2 a year. in 5 years you are producing 40 million 
    per year. adding FSD makes that 40 vehicles do the work of 200 million vehicles. 
    sell the cars at cost, say $10k. in ten years the world vehicle inventory has
     been replaced and one third of global CO2 emmisions have been eliminated. add 
    another trillion to do the same for solar and wind production to fix the energy 
    production problem. add a couple of trillion to cut the time down to five years.
    if these numbers are wrong, add another trillion until they add up. given the 
    eventual cost of the coming climate catastrophe, every trillion dollars you 
    throw into fixing the problem eliminates several trillion dollars in losses of 
    capital and human suffering.",2118,True,1634413077.0,2021-10-16 21:37:57,0,14,rainerdeusser,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/q9iyxe/why_are_analysts_often_wrong_about_tesla/,True,0.39,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,
comment,q9iyxe,q9iyxe,,"Because analysts go to school to learn how to value companies in ways that only make sense if the industry is not changing.  

Take for example coca cola. Nothing coke does is going to significantly impact their market share. There is no technological marvel that will make coke obsolete or give them an edge against the competition. They are in a mature industry of bottling, canning, and distributing. The financial models wallstreet used are based on looking at companies like coca cola and trying to determine if money can be made within a quarter or a year and no longer than that by buying or selling a mature company with no significant amount of ground to be gained or lost.  

Tesla has two problems when it comes to wallstreet. The first is that it is a disruptive company, meaning Tesla's success directly offsets not a competing brand but the existence of other products entirely. This means that it's value isn't purely tied up into profits today, and it isn't possible to use historical models based on the automotive industry, but that doesn't mean analysts aren't going to insist this isn't the case and try to shoehorn the company into one of those models.

You’re right they don’t get the same amount of sales as traditional car makers. But they offer arguably the best EVs on the market. 

Their fans aren’t delusional. It’s marketing. Same reason iPhone sales never slowed down despite Android users having all the “top features” before them. The issue is here is Tesla has the marketing of Apple, and the “cost” of the android. 

What do you mean by “no actual data”? Are they supposed to release statistical results of products years before they release them? 

Autopilot is getting sued and rightfully so. There have been accidents and deaths. But there is a difference between their autopilot and self driving packages. And the thing is, no other car maker has an auto pilot software package that comes close to Tesla. Yes there are assisted driving packages, but Tesla also has over 5 years of data for their autopilot and self driving features. That data is the most valuable thing for them, as it will keep their software years ahead of the competition. Would I personally use autopilot? No. But is Tesla the world lead in automated driving? Yes. 

Honestly, you need to define what “catch up” means. Are traditional car makers going to catch up in EV sales? Yes. Most carmakers have begun the process of transitioning fully electric.

Earnings per share (adjusted): $1.86 vs $1.59 expected per Refinitiv

Revenue: $13.76 billion vs $13.63 billion expected per Refinitiv


**Cash**

Operating cash flow less capex (free cash flow) of $1.3B in Q3

Net debt and finance lease repayments of $1.5B in Q3

In total, $164M decrease in our cash and cash equivalents in Q3 to $16.1B


**Profitability**

2.0B GAAP operating income; 14.6% operating margin in Q3

$1.6B GAAP net income; $2.1B non-GAAP net income (ex-SBC1) in Q3 30.5% GAAP Automotive gross margin (28.8% ex-credits) in Q3

**Operations**

Record vehicle production and deliveries in Q3
Started roll out of FSD City Streets Beta to a wider population in October

**Summary**

The third quarter of 2021 was a record quarter in many respects. We achieved our best-ever net income, operating profit and gross profit. Additionally, we reached an operating margin of 14.6%, exceeding our medium-term guidance of “operating margin in low-teens”.

Perhaps more impressively, this level of profitability was achieved while our ASP2 decreased by 6% YoY in Q3 due to continued mix shift towards lower-priced vehicles. Our operating margin reached an all-time high as we continue to reduce cost at a higher rate than declines in ASP.
EV demand continues to go through a structural shift. 

We believe the more vehicles we have on the road, the more Tesla owners are able to spread the word about the benefits of EVs. While Fremont factory produced more cars in the last 12 months than in any other year, we believe there is room for continued improvement. Additionally, we continue to ramp Gigafactory Shanghai and build new capacity in Texas and Berlin.

post,qcsef1,,Tesla’s “Record Quarter” Smashes Earnings,"Electric vehicle maker Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) reported its quarterly earnings on Wednesday, which the company called a “record quarter,” including its best-ever net income and gross profit.

Numbers: Tesla’s earnings per share of $1.86 beat expectations. Its revenue of $13.76 billion was also better than what most analysts expected.

Good Margins: The company reported an operating margin of 14.6%, which exceeded its prior expectations for the quarter. Its total gross margin of 26.6% was a record for the company.

Half Glass Empty: Despite the good earnings, shares of Tesla dipped 1.64% in after-hours trading. The company cited numerous challenges during the quarter, including the chip shortage and congestion at the ports.

Missing: Tesla said that its new Cybertruck is still in development and offered no new updates.

Final Thoughts: Shares of Tesla are up 17% in the past month. It’s still one of the most polarizing stocks for investors.

post,qe5175,,The coming clash of Tesla's 10k$ FSD vs the 0$ alternatives," Tesla currently is selling its FSD at 10k$ which is at a beta phase and will be for years.

Meanwhile other manufacturers like Toyota, Honda, Nissan, etc are giving their driver-assistance systems for 0$, which includes: auto parking, auto change lanes, auto braking, auto change lanes, auto surpass, auto speed mainly in highways.

Tesla and the others have a huge difference: Tesla plans to increase its FSD price every x years, meanwhile the others plan to give it for 0$ but never in an alpha/beta version, only finished systems but with a slower release rate.

Right now Tesla has the problem of being the 1st at charging a price for its system, which is like being the 1st at making the roomba and asking 10k$ for its advanced cleaning system vs the others just giving a basic cleaning system for free.

Tesla:

1. Roomba with AI, Lidar, bluetooth, autocharging, steam cleaning, room mapping, audio controlled, camera, auto picture to the phone with crashes.

Toyota/Nissan/Honda/etc

1. Roomba with crash detection

Then there is Waymo that its like tesla but if it only charges 50% of what tesla asks tesla is doomed.

post,qera06,,Feeling constantly busy? 3 ways to fix that,"**busy** \[ˈbɪzi\] - *adjective*, **having a great deal to do**.

Or as I like to rephrase it, busy = almost every single person I know at all times.

It’s a relatively new thing in our culture, and not only among hustlers and adults. Maybe it’s a consequence of the ever-increasing schoolwork we need to get done, which serves to prepare you for the ever-increasing (in price) university degree, which then leaves you semi-qualified for a job you may not like that much. 

The answer to the question “What’s up?” is usually one of the two: “Nothing.” or “Oh, been busy.”.

Even if you aren’t feeling busy in particular, it feels logical that we prefer to exaggerate how busy our day is than admit to not doing much. After all, our societal perspective of the word “busy” carries a much more positive vibe.

However, this constant feeling of being behind doesn’t get us too far. Always being torn between different deadlines and projects to maintain, while you still have to take care of your own health, mind, social life - now that’s a surefire way to end up as a stressed-out burnout victim. Thankfully, there are ways to counteract this modern disease.

Spoiler alert for those who are too *busy* to read ahead:

1. Make clear objectives
2. Add buffer to your time blocks
3. Reflect frequently

>Oct 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surpassed $1 trillion in market value on Monday after landing its biggest-ever order from rental car company Hertz, a deal that reinforced the electric car leader's ambitions to top the entire auto industry in sales over the next decade.

>Tesla shares surged as much as 14.9% to $1,045.02, making it the world's most valuable automaker according to Reuters calculations based on its latest filing.

>Even Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk expressed surprise at the velocity of the surge. ""Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem,"" Musk tweeted in reply to a comment by Ross Gerber, co-founder of the investment fund Gerber Kawasaki and a Tesla shareholder.

>""Wild $T1mes!"" Musk wrote in a separate tweet.

>Tesla is the first carmaker to join the elite club of trillion-dollar companies that includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).

>Most automakers do not boast about sales to rental car companies, often made at discounts to unload slow-selling models. But for Tesla and its investors, Hertz's decision to order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022 showed electric vehicles are no longer a niche product, but will dominate the mass car market in the near future.

>""Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,"" Hertz interim Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters.

>Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has set an annual sales growth target of 50%, on average, eventually reaching 20 million vehicles a year. That would be more than twice the volume of current sales leaders Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).

post,qg4jcj,,Every Meeting Should Be Optional: Here’s Why…,"At the beginning of the year, we introduced a 100% optional meeting culture at our startup. At first, this might sound scary to many managers - *will anybody attend my meetings?* \- however, we've experienced that it's a key step towards a more productive meeting culture.

Disclaimer: I’m not advocating to dismiss all sync meetings, but rather to not make attendance mandatory. A simple act that has profound effects before, during, and after meetings.

The importance of Deep Work is already covered in various posts. So today, I’m discussing our less obvious lessons with optional meetings.

So let’s jump to it!

# Lesson 1: Optional meetings = better meetings

Meetings are no longer top-down or one-way exchanges of information. This is more so true of startups and async-first teams. Although there are exceptions to the rule, in 95% of cases, optional attendance increases the quality of meetings.

&#x200B;

**Reason 1: Optional meetings foster a give-first mentality among organizers**

Forced attendance doesn’t do meeting organizers any justice: If all meeting “participants” are forced to attend, meeting organizers aren’t incentivized to improve the meeting experience. In an alternate meeting world, if an organizer wants a higher attendance rate (*which you cannot force)*, then they’re likely to make voluntary participation more enticing.

*This could look like this:*

* Thorough agenda planning, so all can evaluate the meeting’s value. Thus, attendees will come prepared and increase the meeting output.
* Items only relevant to fewer attendees may be addressed first.
* An open-mic session, so attendees can discuss relevant points.

Over time, this effect will be compounded. The organizer is incentivized to sell the value of a meeting before it starts. The organizer also learns from what didn’t work.

&#x200B;

**Reason 2: Optional meetings are leaner**

Not everybody gets equal value out of any given meeting.",5724,True,1635248499.0,2021-10-26 13:41:39,4,1,BigSmile17,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/qg4jcj/every_meeting_should_be_optional_heres_why/,True,0.76,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,qj07jj,,On Tesla's valuation,"Tesla's valuation is probably one of the most hotly debated topics in the stock market these past few years. Tesla is certainly richly valued, and sentiments like ""Tesla has a higher market cap than all other automakers combined"" or ""Tesla has decades of growth priced in"" are very prevalent, especially on this sub.

That said, I noticed a trend where - although lots of different people are saying this and people defending Tesla's market cap are often downvoted - the people who make this argument never use any numbers to back up their claims. So I figured it might be nice to have an objective look at Tesla's trends and projections, run the numbers, and see how richly valued Tesla really is.

**For those who don't like reading, I will now explain how I got to my numbers. If you don't like reading, skip straight to ""The Numbers""**

----------------------------

**The method**

While trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap has risen slightly higher, let's use a market cap of $1T to determine if Tesla really deserves to be a trillion dollar company.

--------------------------------

**The trends**

In terms of revenue (LTM), Tesla has grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021. A 66% growth YoY.

In terms of operating margin, Tesla has grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021.

In terms of net income (LTM), Tesla has grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,468M after Q3 2021. A 524% growth YoY.

---------------------------------

**The future**

Obviously Tesla won't be able to maintain such a high growth rate.",5813,True,1635595837.0,2021-10-30 14:10:37,866,753,Ehralur,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/,True,0.88,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,qmjr7o,,"Tesla sells 1% of cars globally, yet is priced more than the companies combined that sell the other 99%","The valuation on Tesla is now beyond the absurd.  

Whilst European EV sales explode to presently 19% of all car sales this year, Tesla does not even make the top five EV sellers by company at a lowly 7%. (VW 25%; Stellantis 13%; Daimler 10%; BMW 10%; Hyundia-Kia 9%).

Tesla, unlike in the US, is simply being outsold by the vast array of alternative BEV models on sale particularly.  VW group alone offers the e-up, ID3 and ID4 (ID5 not yet on sale); Audi e-tron, e-tron Sportback e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT; Cupra Born; and Skoda Enyaq

In China Tesla has been pushed into 3rd place this year by BYD which has seen EV sales grow from 53K Q1; 98K.Q2; 183K Q3.  Tesla meanwhile has seen China quarterly sales for 2021 flattish at 69K, 62K and 75K.  China will likely sell 3 million EV's this year, half the worlds volume and Tesla sales are flat for the year.  Tesla might sell a lowly 9%.

Tesla dominates the US markets of course, where few EV models are on sale.  EV sales might be 3% of automotive sales.

Whilst investors will assert these stats do not.matter and Tesla's valuation is all about  tech, batteries and robo-taxis, it still does not sell any car related tech beyond its own cars.  Take up of FSD is a lowly 11%.  It still buys it's battery cells.  By its own statements it has a level 2/3 driver assist whilst companies like Waymo are already starting to offer level 4/5 robo-taxis in cities like San Fran (a free trial program has commenced).

With Tesla slipping badly in the two biggest and mature EV markets globally, it's EV mkt share has fallen from near 18% highs in 2019 to 14.7% YTD in 2021.  With Europe and China likely to see 20% EV sales, the Tesla domination of global car mkts story is looking utterly flawed, yet its market capitalisation is now than the entire companies combined that sell 99% of cars and are adding EV's faster.

Tesla is frankly trading at utterly ludicrous levels given the clear reality of global EV market growth.",2036,True,1636029919.0,2021-11-04 13:45:19,11487,2304,Historical_Job_8609,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qmjr7o/tesla_sells_1_of_cars_globally_yet_is_priced_more/,True,0.84,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,qmllp4,,RIVN IPO on November 10,"Rivian is set to have a high profile IPO. Their S1-A prospectus released on Nov 1 is available here:
https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-315537/


**THE IPO FUNDAMENTALS**

Some key elements to pull out of here:

* 861M shares total
* 155M shares available during IPO (135M for public, 20M for underwriters)
* PT of $62

This gives RIVN a market cap of $55Bn with the goal of raising $8Bn in funding during this IPO.

**THE COMPANY FINANCIALS**

Right now, RIVN has zero revenue. Consider them like QuantumScape. They're set to release product soon, but they have no commercialized product currently.

In 2020, they racked up total operational net losses of $1Bn. In 2021, they're on track for net losses of $2Bn. These are all costs associated with what they term as ""Research and development"" and ""Selling, general, and administrative"".

Their goal is to operate in the truck market initially, focusing on consumer truck/SUV vehicles and then delivery fleet vehicles (EDV). This is similar to what WKHS/RIDE were trying to accomplish.

The S1 has RIVN projecting Amazon buying 100,000 EDVs from them, and growing the preorders of their R1T and R1S consumer models.

**THE PRODUCT**

RIVN is focusing on the SUV/Truck market, and this makes sense for America as trucks and SUVs consistently outsell all other vehicles on the road. Based on reviews, the R1T is ranked at 4th place comparing against other EVs by Car and Driver:
https://www.caranddriver.com/rivian/r1t

The R1T looks like a truck, and is designed very much to provide the culturally American truck experience. With the Cybertruck delayed into 2022, RIVN may have the first mover advantage, but again its hard to compare to TSLA who is just a runaway behemoth and cult brand at this point.

Car and Driver's review glow about Rivian's offroad and rugged capabilities. It really seems to live up to the hype. Though there are worries about battery efficacy compared to the ModelX. The R1T is priced $30k cheaper than the ModelX.",4004,True,1636035512.0,2021-11-04 15:18:32,55,52,radarbot,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qmllp4/rivn_ipo_on_november_10/,True,0.89,2021,both,search,False,False,0,

post,qp2fum,,I guess I need to learn how to stop using my turn signal,"I’ve loved all things motor-driven since I was pretty young, especially since first seeing the 3rd gen (FD) RX-7 break cover in the December ‘91 issue of Motor Trend and falling in love. The next summer, visiting family in the Caribbean when I was 11, I got a chance to ride a Honda Lead and then learned sequential shifting on a 125cc Cub. On the same trip, My uncle taught me to drive his 5-speed Nissan Sunny (mostly I think so he could drag me to his Rotary Club meetings and get rum drunk, and I could nervously poke us back to the house at about 30kph in 2nd gear while he sang at the top of his lungs.)

Within a year of that, I was at the library obsessing about the story of Lee Iacocca and the ‘64 1/2 Mustang then deciding I wanted a ‘68 fastback, and then settling on a ‘69 Boss 302, or 429, or you know, at least a Mach 1. Never did get the Mustang, but have owned and driven and ridden in/on a huge variety of different cars, trucks and bikes in the ensuing 30 years. What I’d never driven or really experienced in all that time was a BMW.

I’d ridden in a cousin’s clapped out E21 3 Series as a littlun, and partially the fact that it was more rattling subwoofer than car (complete with Benzi Box and “NO / RADIO!” sticker), and partially that I was (incredibly uncomfortably) sat on someone’s lap, I was too young to appreciate anything special about it other than it was loud, rattly and scary. In the ensuing years, my dad always mocked and derided Bimmers and their drivers, mostly because we lived in NYC and I suppose most BMW drivers were a special brand of rude, self absorbed asshole in the 80s and 90s (saying a lot considering you have to be some of those things just to drive in Brooklyn.) I always carried that with me. Bimmers were Cars for Assholes™️, and anyone that drove one was probably a sociopath, or at least compensating for some terrible lack of parental love as a child.

comment,qumuxo,qumuxo,,">We contacted Ford public relations, who confirmed our suspicions. ""The GT has around 5 seconds of [maximum] boost, so once that boost is used up, it needs to recharge,"" we were told. That means it can only deliver 5 seconds of full power at a time before the battery takes a breather. In a direct comparison against the Model Y Performance, which had no problem delivering full power whenever we asked, this made the Mustang Mach-E GT feel underwhelming to say the least.

Wow, pretty shitty to limit the max power to 5 seconds. The Mach-E looks much better than the duck-lipped Y but if you can't use all the power all the time, seems like a huge rip-off to go with the GT.

Edit: seems crazy reading back on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/po712y/new_mach_e_gt_runs_the_14_mile_in_126_100mph_trap/) where people were discussing the issue.

post,qw013h,,Rivian - Is this the right time to buy?,"Electric vehicle maker Rivian became the second-largest IPO in US history on Wednesday by raising an estimated $12 Billion. It’s the 12th largest listing ever for an IPO. The shares made a 37% listing gain and the stock has rallied since the listing and is now trading at \~$145 ($125 Billion valuation) which makes it more valuable than both Ford and General Motors.

It’s easy to dismiss Rivian’s performance as yet another stock that is caught up in the current EV hype train led by Tesla. But in this week’s analysis, let’s deep dive into the history of Rivian, what made them so successful, is the current valuation justified and finally, whether it’s the right time to invest in the company \[1\].

**The Company**

Rivian started way back in 2009 and before pivoting to trucks and SUVs, Rivian was also following the Tesla model with its first car [intended to be a sports car.](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uhCAQxp9muWkAEXYPHHrpaxCE0SWrYGG0tU9fXG-dTOZP8k2-yc9ZhCnlQyMUJGsqaPBYQUf4LjMgQiZbgWyC18RrqrhTAwnFjBlgsWHWZN2GOTiLIcVT1SlGJSNP7WTXi5668U6tEJRRIb1iMDrgo6CPx2VmNx8gOtCwQz5SBDLrJ-Jabt3HjX_WDLEED7CX1qWl7udntfWd6gWvQw57sLEpa8pYGmdzExM28OPmzYOvAhI0p5zVkIwz2j9a3krmhLoz4UcmBOeyxa8n3ukv3ARdJtaWbSho3ev0JFkvNr8AC0QMSy3tHPZTOZ0E3pIKwdS-bDHgYSDaYQavMW9A8EL7pmUmiJArcm8saiY7RaWQkjKpLhwV4MlKcElJ_cGnehX_2_8BlnyTSg)

 It was only in Dec’17 that the company announced its shift to an electric five-passenger pickup truck and an electric seven-passenger SUV. The company aims to have a vertically integrated structure with a vast majority of R&D occurring in-house.  

The idea is to not only sell the vehicles but upsell and also create recurring revenues from each sale. Rivan expects to make a whopping $67,900 per customer over ten years in additional revenue from products and services.

**Products**

post,r475zh,,Why will stock markets fall drastically in 2021?,"Below are a few characteristics of big bubbles…

-Insanely high equity valuations.
Everyone is long risky/speculative assets.
The average retail investor who doesn’t do any research can buy any stock and make money.

-General price acceleration, along with insane price acceleration in different areas (Tesla, GameStop, Bitcoin, and etc.).

-Buy-in on central banks’ ability and willingness to bail everyone out.
While I could be wrong, I don’t think the trigger is really there for the bubble to pop. According to a research report by Bank of America:

“The global economy has maintained momentum into the new year, with expectations of 5.3% expansion this year, the strongest since 1973, up from 3.4% contraction in 2020.”

Under normal circumstances, there’d be a trigger for the bubble to pop, but we are NOT in a standard market regime.

The world has gone autopilot on quantitative easing (QE), which means creation of new money in order to help the economy.

This surplus-free liquidity, which is currently growing at 55% year-over-year in the U.S., is a lot higher than the 32% growth in liquidity after the 2008 crash.

Unlike in 2008, this time, monetary policy will team up with the fiscal side and really drive inflation to an extreme.

Just look at how the Fed’s balance sheet is at 42% of GDP.
The more central banks expand their balance sheet, the higher the stock market goes.

Remember the CARES Act, and now Biden calling for another $1.9T fiscal stimulus (more to come, I guarantee it)?

This is all NEW MONEY created that will flow into the real economy.

And so, as long as the Fed (and the world) keeps printing new money out of thin air, the stock market will continue to be inflated in value.

Which also means that it’s unlikely for anyone to really experience significant crashes.

While these forces are pushing the stock market higher, the amount of currency debasement (inflation) that will occur from all this new money creation will be massive.",3715,True,1638114392.0,2021-11-28 16:46:32,0,16,CassandraReys,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r475zh/why_will_stock_markets_fall_drastically_in_2021/,True,0.3,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

I actually think it's the opposite - that they see people posting [screenshots like this](https://preview.redd.it/hn6ffueeyvf61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d063d33ffe51a2a552facb4f548bef8203dae476) and think ""that can be me!"" It's coming out of excitement and optimism, not despair.

post,raml8o,,Is the party coming to an end?,"Just thinking ""aloud"" here. What can we expect in the coming years?

1. Slower growth  
Stock market returns over the last 15 or so years are largely the result of boomers in their peak earning years, rushing to prepare for retirement (and recover from the '00, '08 crashes). This trend will come to an end soon, as the majority of boomers retire over the next few years, and move towards more conservative investments. Maybe dividend stocks will become interesting again. Don't expect tech stocks to keep crashing to the upside.
2. Higher interest rates  
Inflation will force interest rates up, and the resulting increase in the cost of capital will slow corporate growth. This is a tricky one, because increased interest rates could make it hard to service the national debt, which is now over 100% of GDP - maybe they *can't* go up much.
3. Higher taxes  
Because of #2, government will need more revenue to service its debt. Also, high interest will drive down bond prices, so don't buy those. We'll also need more taxes to pay for the boomers' social security and medicare, from a smaller pool working-age people (gen X).
4. Lower housing prices  
Higher interest = lower housing prices. Also, the migration of high-earning professionals to the suburbs is decreasing demand - and supply of qualified buyers. But even if SFRs drop in price, they will still be unaffordable to the majority of people, so multifamily will likely not be affected much.

So... with lower growth on the horizon, we should focus on income. Stay away from high-PE stocks, wheel the SPY, and invest the premiums in some dividend ETFs.

I'm still expecting TSLA to keep crashing to the upside, because they're doing the right things at the right time: the transition to electric transportation and self-driving are as inevitable as the rise of the internet and smartphones, and they are years ahead of the rest of the industry.

post,ravhtu,,"Rivian is the one that could disrupt Tesla, analysts say","A flurry of Wall Street ratings boosted Rivian Automotive Inc. stock on Monday, nearly a month after the company went public, with analysts giving the Amazon-backed electric-vehicle maker mostly bullish endorsements.

Of the 13 analysts surveyed by FactSet, eight set ratings on Rivian that were the equivalent of buy, while the other five rated it the equivalent of hold. There are so far no bears. The average price target on the stock was $134.42, which was about 28% above Friday’s stock closing price of $104.67, and about 72% above the $78 initial public offering price.

The stock RIVN, +11.57% surged more than 4% on Monday, putting it on track to snap a four-session losing streak. It was now trading 37% below its Nov. 16 high close of $172.01, but was still 39% above its IPO price. **Baird analyst George Gianarikas initiated Rivian at outperform with a $150 stock price target**, saying he believes the company can “formidably challenge” Tesla Inc.’s TSLA, -0.59% market dominance. He said the company has adopted a “promising, vertically integrated approach,” reinforced by a robust balance sheet, Amazon partnership and strong recruitment.

“Vertical integration, however, requires scale to extract benefits, and, as such, Rivian needs to ramp quickly and effectively to materialize as a serious long-term contender,” Gianarikas wrote in a note to clients. “That is, Clark Kent (\[Chairman and Chief Executive\] RJ Scaringe) needs to emerge from the phone booth as Superman soon to scale Rivian and save the planet.”

**Wedbush’s Dan Ives also started Rivian with a bullish outperform rating, and set a $130 stock price target**, saying the “stalwart EV startup” is looking to strategically launch itself into an untapped market as SUV and pickup truck EVs are currently virtually nonexistent in the EV market.

post,reu1b9,,First 24hrs with my Model Y Performance (spoiler: full motor failure),"**Backstory**

I've always been into cars, and I was looking to get a new vehicle as my winter/practical car. I'm keeping my S4 and 718 Cayman S as well, so this was going to be in addition to those 2. I've been in enough Audi/BMW/Mercs/Porsches and wanted something different. Smooth power, roomy interior, cool factor and quiet ride were my main considerations. I don't need the all out performance of something like an X3M or GLC63 since I've got other cars. I wanted this to be a stark contrast to my current 2 vehicles.

&nbsp;

Decided a MYP would be a good fit, especially with very strong resale value. I can keep it for a few years and see what the electric market is like with Rivian, electric Macan etc. The ordering and delivery process was terrible, but that's another story. It was easily the worst ""dealership"" experience I've had buying any car (new or used).

&nbsp;

Anyways, I get my car on the evening of Dec 10th. By the afternoon of the 11th, it had a rear motor failure followed by a completely dead vehicle that's unable to drive. 

&nbsp;

**Motor Failure** 

Picked up my blue on white MYP on the evening of Dec 10th. By the afternoon of the 11th, it had a [rear motor failure](https://imgur.com/FqTE42h) and 2 mins later was [completely undriveable](https://imgur.com/2NQjz3W) and had to be towed to the dealer. It was being driven at 60km/h when a warning came up about the rear motor. A couple mins later, it was fully dead. Luckily I was near a friends house and parked it in their driveway. Would have sucked if this happened on the highway. I googled the error and it seems like this has happened to other people before, and usually pretty soon after delivery. Still, off too a pretty terrible start with the car.

&nbsp;

Bad things I've noticed over the first 24hrs, coming from someone who's into cars and driven a bunch of stuff on street/track:

**Brief History:**
I bought the CX-5 primarily for the higher seating position - was in a [white 2016 Honda Civic](https://imgur.com/aRvUqKH) before that - and secondarily for the gorgeous Soul Red, in the Touring trim with the Preferred package. The CX-5 was great for roadtrips, minor off-roading (read: non-paved roads in national parks), being very visible on the road to other drivers, had a robust safety suite (forward collision warning, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert - but no parking sensors for the 2018 Touring), and the candy apple red was a remarkable conversation piece. At the time it was a great deal and good value for the money (~$34k OTD).

The hankering for a convertible hit me when I saw a Mercedes-Benz drop its top at a stop light. The morning was sunny, wind was pleasant, outside temp was a breezy 70 (Fahrenheit). The idea - once taken root - never quite let go from 2019. I opened the sunroof on the CX-5 at most available opportunities anyhow so I began my… 

**Research:**
I didn’t take action until the CX-5 was paid off (and driven nearly [46k miles](https://imgur.com/JUJf3KR)) , but once it was I began looking. Unfortunately the pandemic was (is?) in full swing, and used car prices were (are) through the proverbial roof - more so for convertibles (pun intended :D).",34507,True,1639378759.0,2021-12-13 07:59:19,12,28,quirkynature,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/rf9om3/i_replaced_an_apple_with_an_orange_err_a/,True,0.68,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

comment,rl5sr8,rl5sr8,,"> Tesla has run into a lot of red tape while trying to get approval to start production at Gigafactory Berlin

They didn't run into any red tape. Tesla has to comply to all rules and laws in Germany. Just like any other company has too. They got plenty of pre-approvals and all their submitted documents and applications are being fast tracked. For a project this size in Germany, it's going *very* quick.

> environmental groups had managed to obtain an extension of the public commentary period for the project

And rightfully so! No special treatment for anyone. 

The state tried to fast track the public hearing process but broke its own rules by doing so. They got caught by the public and now have to re-do it properly. If they don't, the state would open doors for lawsuits that would put the whole project at jeopardy. Better safe than sorry.

It also doesn't help that Tesla itself repurposed entire buildings they already had built. A huge warehouse suddenly became the building for cell production for example. Because of that the whole approval process for the building and its intended use had to be re-done. This wouldn't have been necessary if Tesla stated the real purpose of the building from the get go. Delays like this are self made.

Tesla also didn't stick to it's own submitted construction plans multiple times and still were given leeway to proceed. The whole area is a groundwater reserve. In Germany it's forbidden to put buildings on piles in areas like that.",1890,True,1640072516.0,2021-12-21 08:41:56,11,0,rimalp,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/rl5sr8/tesla_model_ys_spotted_at_gigafactory_berlin_but/hpeflbr/,True,,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,hpeflbr

Over the last year, Tesla has run into a lot of red tape while trying to get approval to start production at Gigafactory Berlin, a giant new factory located near Berlin in Brandenburg. Most recently, environmental groups had managed to obtain an extension of the public commentary period for the project, which delayed approval for another month. The new period concluded last month, and Tesla has been rumored to be on the verge of approval, but it has yet to happen.

Earlier this week, we reported that the Ministry for the Environment said that Tesla and other entities have yet to deliver all the needed documents for approval.

post,rmbhqh,,My extensive Porsche Taycan Turbo Review,"My Model 3 AWD lease is about to end. While I generally have positive things to say about my Tesla experience, my Tesla hasn’t exactly been scratching my itches as a car enthusiast. So I am currently at a bit of a crossroads, buy another Tesla and get an affordable-ish sports car. Or combine the funds into one nicer vehicle. 

The problem with the one nicer vehicle is the fact that it does need to be EV. While I am sure a lot of great EV vehicles will burst onto the scene in the next three years, there’s really only one car on the market currently that feels like it might be an upgrade from my Tesla while also satiating my enthusiast desires and that is the Porsche Taycan. 

Now I’ll be honest in saying that I am by no means a Porsche fan. I drove a 997 911 Turbo as well as a 718 Cayman base and I walked away from both cars feeling like they were sports cars on Xanax. They just weren’t exciting for me. 

Likewise, I am by no means a Tesla fanboy. I think they have EV offerings that make a lot of sense, but as a car enthusiast I do long for something that feels a bit more special. 

Unfortunately when reading comparisons between Tesla’s and Taycan’s they pretty quickly devolved into descriptions that felt too simple to me. “If you want a well built car with a great driving experience get the Taycan” “If you want a good charging network, like technology, and need lots of range get a Tesla” While I knew both of those general sentiments to be inherently true, I felt like they were leaving out a lot of details and that the folks righting these statements were inherently pro Tesla or pro Taycan making it hard to find what felt like an unbiased opinion.

post,rr7lja,,"SUV, CUV, crossover, off-roader, adventure vehicle. . .","I've been griping for a while about this industry trend of advertising every possible vehicle as a ""SUV"", because the marketing departments have all decided that's the word that sells cars, the label that shoppers respond to.  One of the most egregious examples (IMHO) is the Tesla Model Y.  I mean, it's a Model 3 sedan with a slightly *taller* profile and a hatch back.  Yet it seems like everyone calls it a SUV.  Tesla call it a SUV.

You take a sedan, you give it a higher stance and a hatch back, and there's an established word for that: CUV (crossover utility vehicle), or just ""crossover"".  Because it crosses over between the sedan and SUV categories, right?  That was logical.  But somehow that didn't resonate with the public, and they don't want to buy a crossover or CUV, but they are happy to buy the exact same vehicle if it's called SUV.

So, what are we going to call actual, real SUVs now?  What is the Jeep Wrangler?  What is the Ford Bronco?

As mentioned, I've been griping about this for a while, but now I'm beginning to question myself.  Why am I trying to defend the purity and correct usage of ""SUV"", itself a clunky and kind of dumb marketing buzzword that I never liked to begin with?  Maybe I should just give it up and accept that from now on the ugly term SUV is what we use to describe crossovers, a category  of ugly vehicles that I never liked to begin with.  Let them belong together; they deserve one another.

As for actual off-roaders. . .   Hmm.  Maybe we should call them ""off-roaders"".  Didn't we used to call them that, once upon a time?  Please, let's not make them ""adventure vehicles"" now.

Yes, no and no, I don't watch TV.

post,rshvy0,,Why I sold my Tesla Model 3 Performance & went back to gas,"I owned a 2019 Tesla Model 3 Performance for roughly two years and 15,000 miles. I'm going to distill my key learnings and experiences here, in an attempt to educate others on EVs and reach some form of closure. My ownership could best be summed-up as a love/hate relationship, ending with crazy used car values offering me the out I'd been quietly seeking. Clearly, I decided EVs aren't for me - at least, not yet. I'm not a ""paid big oil shill"" or someone who's trying to short the stock, as I'm sure some of the Tesla nuts will claim. I'm just a car enthusiast (disclaimer: not an engineer) standing at the same crossroads as the rest of you, wondering what sounds future children will make long after (if?) our beloved bureaucrats outlaw the ICE.

Everything I'm writing here is based on my own unique tastes and preferences. How the pros and cons balance out at the end is entirely up to you. And that's fine. Choice is great. Note that this post centers on Battery EVs (BEVs) at the time of this writing, which comprise the vast majority of EVs on the road today.

And yeah. This got way longer than I anticipated. But it was cathartic for me and I hope it's at least somewhat useful to someone out there.

# EV performance & its accessibility

I'll start with what ultimately sold me on the car - **Immense, instant power.** The war in the ""pure acceleration"" category is pretty much over - just take a look at Jason Cammisa's video with the Model S Plaid vs. the BMW M5 CS and Cadillac Crazy. They're not even on the same planet. Not only is the acceleration brutal, but it's consistent (everything else held constant - more on that later). Look up any number of 0 - 60 videos on YouTube, and you'll notice that the times are all remarkably close, especially if there are multiple runs in the same video.

And how could they not be? Software and traction control are fundamental to EV operation.

comment,rshvy0,rshvy0,,">At the time of this writing, you're kidding yourself if you think that there's any other viable EV option besides a Tesla

I think you left off what you expect in a car. If you're looking for a ""one size fits all"" car that is a drop-in replacement for conventional cars, it's going to be hard to find the perfect EV, especially if you enjoy long distance driving.

But if you're looking for a commute car and have a place to charge it (at work or home), an EV is a great option. I have a 100 mile range EV and love it -- it goes everywhere I need to go. It's a stretch to make the 50 mile trip to the airport, but 15 minutes of charging while I wait for the person to call to say her flight is here is enough to eliminate the range anxiety for the trip home.

It's not our only car, we have a Honda Accord Hybrid that we use for long trips (and my wife uses occasionally while I'm at work). But having the EV  for the daily commute means that we buy fuel so infrequently that I put fuel stabilizer in it to keep the fuel fresh between refueling stops.

I'm waiting until I can afford a car with 400+ miles of range before replacing the Honda with an EV (which means long range cars will need to be cheaper, or I'll need to become more wealthy). This  should give a solid 300+ miles of real world range, so on a long trip, we can drive 7 or 8 hours (which is generally a full day of driving for us) with just a single lunch/recharging stop in the middle.",1454,False,1640928636.0,2021-12-31 06:30:36,897,0,sfbiker999,cars,https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/rshvy0/why_i_sold_my_tesla_model_3_performance_went_back/hqnch35/,True,,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,hqnch35

post,rucgh4,,"2022 Tesla, NIO and LUCID -what to expect","Source:  TheStreetTesla

After a rocky 2020 for the entire auto industry, electric vehicle sales rebounded in 2021 amid high demand for vehicles and a shortage of actual cars to buy. Tesla, to be fair, never really suffered the way many traditional automakers did. The EV-maker led by CEO Elon Musk found ways to keep vehicle deliveries at steady, record levels even as chip shortages caused some automakers to cut production goals.

Part of that, of course, comes because Tesla's overall volume -- while steadily growing -- remains much smaller than the higher-volume traditional automakers. But, it's a tribute to the company's innovation that it managed to grow despite a global chip shortage that impacted the entire auto industry.

EV rivals NIO and Lucid are in a much earlier phase of their journeys, but all three companies have major plans for 2022.

## What Will Tesla Do in 2022 (and Beyond) ?

In the coming year Tesla will expand its capacity as new factories come online. The EV leader now has four factories online -- Fremont, Shanghai, Austin, and Berlin. CFO Zach Kirkhorn laid out where the company stands and where it's going in his remarks during the company's[ Q3 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/21/tesla-tsla-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcript/) with investors.

""Over the last 12 months, we've done about 430,000 cars of production. And based upon everything that we know in the factory, where the bottlenecks are, what the potential is, we're targeting to increase that another 50%,"" he said. ""I think that will be a difficult goal but that's the goal that the internal team has, and they're going to continue to push on that.""

Tesla has ambitious plans to grow how many vehicles it can produce, according to its CFO.

""You know, we're trying to get to 5,000 cars a week as soon as we can,"" he said. ""And then we'll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to 10,000 cars per week at those factories.",5312,True,1641138954.0,2022-01-02 16:55:54,66,149,Vast_Cricket,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/rucgh4/2022_tesla_nio_and_lucid_what_to_expect/,True,0.81,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

So while Tesla will have continued success it's stock price will either stagnate or fall precipitously.

Lucid appears to have some incredible designs coming out.  If they do transfer to manufacturing then they could also become a real automobile manufacturer.  However that is all still to be discovered and their stock price is also completely out of sync with the reality of their ability to make money.

post,rx6jl4,,Financing a Tesla Model 3,"First time financing a car so I really appreciate the help!

I'm financing a Model 3 soon, and I'm confused on the importance of downpayments. I've heard of the 20% rule but looking at how a 10%, 20%, or 50% downpayment affects the total cost of the car over the 72 months, it seems like a large downpayment could be split into investing the money into stocks and crypto, and I can just go off the bare minimum downpayment. Other than the lower monthly payment and avoiding depreciation of the car, I don't see the importance of a huge downpayment.

MSRP of the car is $46490 with my design. A 10% downpayment is about $4.5k, and this puts the total cost of the car over 72 months at $51084. 20% downpayment (\~$9.1k) has a total cost of $50716. Finally, a huge 50% downpayment (\~$23k) has a total cost of $49640. These numbers were all calculated on Tesla's website using their downpayment adjustment and multiplying 72x the monthly payment. These total costs have such a narrow range of cost difference for the huge downpayment ranges. APR rate is 2.49% for all costs.

My confusion comes in over why you wouldn't just choose a bare minimum downpayment and throw most of your money stocks or crypto. I'm sure I could easily make up that $500-1500 price difference of total cost by investing the $4.5k (or a huge chunk of the $23k) into stocks like $AAPL or $TSLA. Even BTC or ETH would have great yields over a 2-3 year timeline.

**TL;DR**: Wouldn't a huge downpayment be better split into a minimum downpayment with the other portion of money going into investments? This is assuming the price range of the total cost is very narrow, regardless of a 10%, 20%, or 50% downpayment.",1684,False,1641446534.0,2022-01-06 06:22:14,5,15,bigfdapresident68,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/rx6jl4/financing_a_tesla_model_3/,True,0.73,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

## Intel Drops A Bomb On The Robotaxi Industry

## Summary

* Despite  most investors focusing on Tesla for robotaxis, Intel’s Mobileye is  currently in volume production of its camera-only L2+ autonomous driving  SuperVision system, beating all competitors to the punch.
* Moreover,  Mobileye announced the world’s first L4 consumer vehicle, launching in  early 2024. Mobileye has a substantial technology and first-mover  advantage.
* If  Tesla bulls can attribute a $1T market cap to their company’s  non-existent robotaxis, then initiating Mobileye at a $1T price target  (representing 20x upside) seems reasonable.
* Mobileye could hence become one of the greatest investments of the coming decades.

## Investment Thesis

In a significant bit of news that likely went largely unnoticed by the investment community, not Tesla ([TSLA](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)), Nvidia ([NVDA](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)) or anyone else, but actually Intel ([INTC](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link))  Mobileye achieved a major milestone in late 2021 by going into volume  production of its camera-only SuperVision autonomous driving system.  Combined with Mobileye's robotaxi business that will start operating in  two international cities in 2022 (based on a camera-based system  combined with a lidar and radar-system), this means autonomous driving  has finally gone from the lab to the fab, and is poised to contribute  billions or even trillions in value to the economy as the technology  gains scale in the coming years and decade(s).",13866,True,1641830554.0,2022-01-10 17:02:34,70,117,polloponzi,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/s0ncv2/intel_drops_a_bomb_on_the_robotaxi_industry/,True,0.71,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,s2baha,,Ya want tires with that?,"A funny thing I've noticed whenever I take my car—either car, the Roadster or the S—into the service center for any reason:  I’m always told, in concerned tones, that my tires are “almost bald” and should be replaced.

I mean, I don’t think I’ve ever gone in with fresh tires just put on the car, but my tires are not almost bald. I have a gauge, I monitor the tread depth, I recently had the S tires rotated. I know what I’m doing. I’ll get new tires when I need them. And the guys telling me I need new tires never mention any actual tread depth measurement. So what’s going on with these guys?

So, here’s my theory. . . Most Teslas on the road are not that old at this point, and I reckon a very large portion of the work done at the service center is warranty work, which means only cost to Tesla, no revenue. Ah, but if they can sell you some tires! Ka-ching! So I think these guys must be trained to tell everyone they need new tires. Sort of like McDonald’s, “You want fries with that?”

And this is not really a complaint, just something I found amusing. I have doubts about how many Tesla owners actually buy their tires from the Tesla service center anyhow. I’ve never had any urge to do that, since I have been getting my tires for many years from a place that’s much closer to me. I can shop for tires online, have them sent directly to the shop, and it couldn’t be easier.

I do suggest buying a quality pressure gauge and a tread depth gauge and looking after your tires. I mean, there’s not much else on a Tesla that needs careful monitoring. Just keep it plugged in (a plugged-in Tesla is a happy Tesla!) and keep the tires in good shape, and you should be golden.",1681,False,1642007339.0,2022-01-12 18:08:59,1,3,ZobeidZuma,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/s2baha/ya_want_tires_with_that/,True,0.53,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc [**(TSLA.O)**](https://us.hidester.com/proxy.php?u=eJwBLADT%2F3M6MzY6ImNkLd0iMyaEk0tJkERdsl7tTV5IjFa%2FRASiV7uQbZjC5LTMmSI7dcgS2Q%3D%3D&b=7) aims to start initial production of its much-anticipated Cybertruck by the end of the first quarter of 2023, pushing back its plan to begin production late this year, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.

The person said the delay comes as Tesla is changing features and functions of the electric pickup to make a compelling product as competition heats up in the segment.

Tesla is expected to make limited production of the Cybertruck in the first quarter of 2023 before increasing output, the source said.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Tesla, the world's top electric car maker, makes electric sedans and sport utility vehicles but has missed out on the pickup truck segment, which is profitable and hugely popular in America.

Ford said early this month it will nearly double annual production capacity for its red-hot F-150 Lightning electric pickup to 150,000 vehicles ahead of its arrival this spring at U.S. dealers.

post,sb7c3z,,My 2019 Model 3 LR vs 2022 Model 3 Performance vs 2022 Model Y Performance Comparison,"I currently own a Tesla Model 3 that is near the end of its lease. The hope was that by the time my Model 3’s lease was over other manufacturers would start to have suitable competitors to Tesla in the EV space. While we’re starting to see that happen, most options are either way out of my price range (Taycan, Audi E-Tron GT) or feel like they haven’t quite matched Tesla yet in terms of range and performance (Polestar 2, Jaguar I-Pace, etc). The BMW I4 M50 is something I’m definitely keeping an eye on, but I could run into availability issues just knowing when my lease is due. So I decided to go to my local Tesla shop to try both the Model Y Performance and Model 3 Performance to see how they stacked up to my current car. 

Since I am already coming from a Tesla I am not going to highlight things like technology, charging infrastructure, etc. I mainly going to focus on the differences between models in terms of design, handling, power, and things that would be most relevant to folks who are a bit more concerned about the overall driving experience.

Lastly, I did only have 30 minutes with each car. But I was able to drive the cars on about 40% of my daily commute and on roads that I am very familiar with (the Tesla service center is a few blocks away from my house). So this is about as apples to apples of comparison as I think I can reasonably give. I do think it’s helpful that I was able to drive these cars back to back and on roads that I know well. 

**Handling:**

**Model Y Performance**

I have to be honest in saying that I am not at all someone who has ever considered a CUV due to my personal emphasis on driving dynamics, however I was pleasantly surprised by the Model Y Performance.

I first fell in love with the 550 in 1998 when I saw a video of a red one on a track being expertly tossed by what looked like a properly skilled/crazy driver who sang praises of its handling and power, in addition to its GT comfort and understatedly elegant design.  At that point I made up my mind that I just had to find a way to own one someday.  Then Bad Boys 2 came out and it was confirmed that mine would need to be Grigio Titanio.  Almost 20 years later, I found myself in the very lucky and privileged position to begin my search for a 550.  The “perfect car” was on consignment at a Ferrari dealer in Southern California; a 2001 final model year example in excellent condition with only 21,000 miles, rare carbon fiber interior, Daytona seats, one-off custom BBS LM 19” wheels, and a McIntosh show car stereo, the removal of which drastically improved performance and handling.  Our goal was to make it the ultimate daily drivable example through the addition of tasteful modifications designed to improve upon the original design and purpose of the car, as well as the overall driving experience.

post,sdggsx,,Tesla earnings are out – here are the numbers,"Tesla reported fourth-quarter earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings (adjusted): $2.54 vs $2.36 per share expected, per Refinitiv

Revenue: $17.72 billion vs $16.57 billion expected, per Refinitiv

Revenue rose 65% year over year in the quarter, while net income, at $2.32 billion, was up some 760%, according to a statement.

Tesla reported a 27.4% gross margin, compared with 26.6% in the previous quarter.

“Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through 2022,” the company said.

The report comes in the midst of the most important tech earnings season in years. The Nasdaq has suffered its worst January since 2008 as many investors have begun to sour on the promise of high-growth tech stocks.

In 2021, Tesla delivered 936,172 vehicles, an 87% increase versus 2020 when it reported its first annual profit on deliveries of 499,647. Its 2021 deliveries included 308,600 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter. (Deliveries are the closest approximation to sales reported by Tesla.)

CEO Elon Musk and other execs are expected to give a progress update on the company’s long-delayed heavy duty Semi truck, experimental Cybertruck pickup, and plans for driverless vehicle systems and a $25,000 compact car.

With factories being built in Austin, Texas, and Brandenburg, Germany, shareholders also want to know when high-volume vehicle production and deliveries are expected to start at each plant.

Tesla’s guidance may be tempered by supply chain issues, if Musk’s tweets are any indication. On November 29, 2021, he wrote on Twitter, “Oh man, this year has been such a supply chain nightmare & it’s not over! I will provide an updated product roadmap on next earnings call.”

post,sep6ud,,"Unlike popular opinion, Tesla's valuation is far from unjustifiable - An analysis based on the numbers","While the overwhelming sentiment around this sub still seems to be that Tesla's valuation is unjustifiable, I have yet to see someone explain that using real data instead of reasoning by analogy (""but Toyota/VW sell X cars"" and is only worth Y""). Looking purely at the numbers, it seems to me Tesla is starting to become insanely undervalued.

This post is largely based on a recent video by Tesla Daily. I believe links to YouTube aren't allowed, but it's his Jan 28th video for anyone who wants to see the detailed version.

So here are the numbers:

After Tesla's Q4 earnings and subsequent 11.5% drop in stock price, its market cap dropped to $833B. Total GAAP earnings for 2021 came in at $5.5B, giving us a PE ratio of 151. ""Ridiculous!"" I hear you say.

Well not so fast. Tesla's earnings in 2021 were up 665%, Q4 earnings was up 760% YoY and earnings in Q1 were just 1/6th of Q4. If we annualize Q4 (basically projecting 0% growth in 2022), we're already at a GAAP net income of $9.3B, or a forward PE of 90.

Now obviously Tesla won't be doing 0% growth in 2022, so let's look at some of the things that seem a given.

First of all, Tesla ""paid"" $910M in stock-based compensation to Elon Musk in 2022 for his CEO compensation plan. For 2022, there is only $65M of that plan left. Since this affects GAAP earnings, this will already mean an $845M increase to Tesla's 2022 earnings. Of course there might be a new compensation plan in the future, but this almost definitely won't affect 2022 and it would only come into effect if the stock rise significantly (I'm personally expecting it to be a plan for $2, 3, 4, ..., 10T in market cap)

Next, Tesla had an increase in SG&A of $340M because of Elon exercising his options. This was a one-time expense that will not occur in 2022. Adding these together, that's an added $1,185M to Tesla's bottom line in 2022, all other things equal. This would bring their PE down to 79.

OP here is clearly one of the bulls who think they can maintain good growth and margins.  Personally, I think they do have a number of potential headwinds in maintaining those.

The good news is that their success in 2021 and share price drop means they are nowhere near as overvalued as they were before.  They are also likely to be able to grow nicely for the next couple of years.  But as time goes on they are going to see a lot of issues with competition growing and margins shrinking.

post,she5td,,"Tesla earnings growth justifies its valuation, here’s the data.","Hey /r/investing, 

I am here to point out that at the moment, Tesla is the most undervalued tech/teracap (stocks that are or were once worth $1 trillion) stock measured by price to earnings growth. All the data will be here in this post.

But first, I want to address some folks here who think Tesla is overvalued because the P/E is 189 (which is down from 1,100 at the end of last year due to blistering fast earnings growth and will be under 100 if Tesla doesn't grow earnings from it's Q4 pace) while American automakers like Ford and GM have P/E around 12 and 7 respectively. Be prepared for some data. 

Tesla is not like Ford or GM and shall not be valued as such. The only similarity is that a majority of revenue comes from cars. However, Tesla is growing revenue much more like a tech company than a car company like for or GM. Tesla also has much higher margins than Ford and GM, and virtually no debt. They are also already 100% EVs while Ford and GM have to transition their sales to EVs. Here's the data :

&#x200B;

**Tesla Revenue growth versus tech and cars**

&#x200B;

|Company|Years to grow from $10B to $50B|Years to grow from $10B to $100B|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Facebook|4.25 years (2014-2018)|6 years (2014-2020)|
|**Tesla**|**4.5 years (2017-2021)**|**Estimated \~5.75 years (2017-2023)**|
|Apple|5 years (2005-2010)|6.25 years (2005-2011)|
|Amazon|5.25 years (2006-2012)|8.75 years (2006-2015)|
|Google |6.75 years (2006-2013)|10.75 years (2006-2017)|
|Microsoft|10.5 years (1996-2007)|21 years (1996-2017)|
|General Motors|17 years (1960-1977)|28 years (1960-1988)|
|Ford|21 years (1964-1985)|24 years (1964-1988)|

Clearly, Tesla is not like Ford and GM if it is growing 4-5x faster than GM and Ford in their heydays. Tesla is growing faster than even its tech company rivals.

1) I'll start with the risks to my valuation model: 

In my opinion, the biggest risk to Tesla is failing to execute on the growth plan. The biggest hindrance I can see for Tesla's valuation will be failing to achieve their 50% YoY growth targets.

If there's an actual economic recession where consumers have to drastically cut back spending, then Tesla would definitely suffer. But this risk is obvious, and probably applies to 99% of growth stocks. Side note: Tesla currently makes such good margin on their EVs, that they have the flexibility of dropping prices to meet demand; however, this would greatly cut into earnings and reinvesting into growth. 

And of course there's the silly, but still very valid, risk to the valuation of companies that the market takes an irrational dive of 20%+, and investors lose confidence in stocks for the foreseeable future. However, Tesla's growth target might still be attainable in this economic environment.

I do \*NOT\* see new EVs from other companies entering the market as a risk to Tesla. There are 80M auto sales globally every year. My model calculates that Tesla obtains 12.1M of the sales (in 2027). This leaves plenty of room for legacy automakers and new EV manufacturers to sell millions of their own EVs.

Quick Note: This model is based \*only\* on EV sales.

**TL;DR: I've wanted a Tesla ever since I heard about them in 2016 and saved/invested accordingly, but life circumstances may have reached a tipping point where I missed my chance.**

I've owned and purchased TSLA stock since 2017 (I wish I bought more, blah blah) and while it's treated me very well, I don't intend on using profits for anything until retirement. After all, why pay taxes and lose out on future gains for something I don't need now, when I have high conviction about future value?

I work from home making 6 figures and my wife works as well, so we're fortunate enough to be well above the average, both nationally and locally. Technically I *could* afford a Model 3 or Y well enough, and even have remaining funds to continue putting aside for bills, investing, trips, etc. We're also having our first baby this summer, but I have planned financially for that as well. Personal finance and budgeting has become a bit of a hobby/obsession of mine these past few years, so it's not a matter of spending beyond my means but rather spending beyond my needs.

All this being said, my wife and I differ greatly on our views of technology and large purchases. I'm a big tech nerd, and a Tesla is the current pinnacle of lifestyle tech in a device I can use almost every day for years to come. Someday it could even make *more* money for us with complete FSD/robotaxi! To her, it's a luxury purchase no one actually needs. To her, spending money on a $50k+ car is unnecessarily lavish at best and recklessly endangering our family's financial future at worst.

I use to think a Tesla as just a luxury car until I saw Tesla crash test videos and understood why an EV can be engineered to be so much safer than a gas car. After realizing that, I wouldn’t buy a gas nor hybrid car ever again; all the tech and bells and whistles are just pluses on top of a safer car that doesn’t pollute.

post,soedun,,Questions regarding undercoating for my truck,"I live in Michigan, so salt and rust is a major issue. I recently got an '18 Sierra, and hope to have it for a long time. That said, rust is the biggest concern I have. 

From what I've read, most people say just stick with Fluid Film and call it day. The problem is I don't have the means to easily do it myself, so it would be a pretty big undertaking to do it once or twice a year. I haven't tried too hard, but I haven't seen any local shops that offer it, or at least none that advertise that they do. Most do Krown, which I've heard to avoid.  I also hear people saying to stay away from rubber/tar coatings as it can actually make things worse. This brings up 2 questions:

&#x200B;

1. A local Line-X dealer uses ValuGard, which they describe as a wax/petroleum hybrid. The application process is to clean the frame first, then they ""fog"" it with the anti-rust and a wax sealent, then apply the hard Line-X black coating. This seams to be a better process then just spraying some FLexseal on it and walking away. Is this a better process or just some smoke and mirrors to make me feel good? They would give it a 7 year warranty if the car is less than 5 years from the model year. 
2. If it isn't a good process, why is it worse then nothing at all? I'm just curious how it would exacerbate rusting, as I've seen some people mention, since the water and salt can get trapped behind any imperfections. But if it's wide open to the road and air, it always has exposure. Wouldn't this help lessen the total area that's exposed?

&#x200B;

post,st09kt,,$TSLA Bullish price is 287USD (DD),"No emotions, minimum speculations, just raw impartial numbers. We will answer once and for all what is the fair value of TSLA.

&#x200B;

**Chapter 1. Bull thesis (and other lies I tell myself?)**

&#x200B;

Let's start with the typical bull thesis. The one you have probably encountered many times in the wilderness of reddit or twitter. It goes like this:

&#x200B;

* Tesla's car sales will grow 50% annually for foreseeable future. Eventually reaching annual production rate of 20M by 2030. Source: [Technoking himself](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393)

&#x200B;

* Net margins will stay as high or even grow further from the latest 13.1% (Q4 2021). Commonly cited reasons are 4680, Gigacasting... maybe even Alien Dreadnought?

&#x200B;

* Tesla is a tech company. They will generate tons of revenue by selling software such as ~~Fraud~~ Full-Self-Driving, and might eventually launch their own marketplace (see AppStore).

&#x200B;

* Tesla is... *ETF**?* (cannot add a link to youtube video, but it is from solving the money problem)

&#x200B;

* Tesla ~~sex~~bot. Enough said.

&#x200B;

Let's start with an automotive sales part:

&#x200B;

* Say Tesla is such Gigachad^(TM) that it reaches 20M sales without reducing the prices or introducing the cheaper model(s). According to Q4 2021 Financial Report, current **ASP is $50.7K**, derived as auto revenue excl. regulatory credits divided by the number of delivered cars. Assuming 3% average inflation for the next 9 years (incl. current spike) the ASP in 2030 would be **$66.2K** (50.7 x 1.03\^9)

&#x200B;

* With **net margins of 13%** that would result in **66.2K x 20M x 0.13 = $172B net income**.

&#x200B;

* Eventually growth by 2030 will taper and converge to automotive industry average. As of writing, PEs of auto peers: Toyota - 9.64, Volkswagen - 6.88, Ford - 10.10, GM - 7.10, BMW - 4.75.

comment,st09kt,st09kt,,"First of all, I’d like to point out there’s only one Wall Street analyst with a price target as low as yours, and they all do much more extensive modeling and plenty of them are bearish and/or dislike Tesla and the hype surrounding it. 

Now, let’s get specific. Your problem is that you assumed that Tesla would grow revenue 26% per year and profit 29% per year (much lower than what they are guiding for, but ok) through 2030 and still get a P/E of 15? That’s ridiculously low for that level of growth. AMZN P/E is around 74 ($3,100 divided by $41.91 EPS excluding one time Rivian stock gain) for lower levels of growth. And before you pull the “but it’s an automotive company” bullshit, think for a second. Tesla already has the highest net income margin in the automotive business and still expanding, has virtually no debt, and has been able to grow faster than any other automotive company. Nothing about Tesla’s business fundamentals says it’s a traditional auto, and it should not be valued as such. You will never see Tesla at 15 P/E this decade.

Your other problem is assuming flat net income margin through 2030. Tesla has shown incredible and consistent operating leverage (meaning operating expenses grow more slowly than revenue/gross profit) hence their constant margin expansion over the last couple years. This is probably your most bearish assumption.

post,syzoi2,,WHY the world needs Electric Vehicles BADLY in light of the Ukraine-Russia Crisis and super high inflation!," [Thankyou for opening your Tesla Folder 📁](https://theteslafolder.substack.com/)

What the hell is going on?

Russia is invading Ukraine, Oil prices have reached $5 a gallon, inflation is at 40-year highs and it seems like the world is getting scarier and scarier everyday…

# Now more than ever YOU NEED to own a Tesla or Electric Vehicle ….. but why?

In this article I talk about the current insane volatility and dooms-day scenario we find ourselves in and specifically how Tesla and electric vehicles can not only save the planet, save your life but also save you lots of money.

It has never been more important to own an Electric Vehicle than it is now, so here is EXACTLY HOW this information ties to your stock portfolio…..

# The Increasing NEED to own an EV⚠

The market in 2022 is absolutely crazy, inflation has reached the highest levels since 40+ years ago. Meanwhile you might have gotten a 5% raise, woo-hoo, oh. Wait. Because inflation is so f\*cking high you’re purchasing power STILL decreased year over year! How crazy is that? The recent macro currents have not been this unpredictable in a very long time, with both the Federal Reserve tightening and potentially WW3 breaking out with the Russian potential invasion of Ukraine.

Because of all this, it is simple. You need an EV. You' need an EV, because it will drastically reduce the amount of money you’re spending on fuelling up your car and getting it serviced. Tesla recently released an amazing feature that highlights the money Tesla owners are saving by not-having to buy gas for their cars. It’s quite staggering.

In one example a Tesla user saved nearly $300 per month, *$300!* Do you not see how crazy that is? With recent gas prices reaching nearly $5 a gallon, it is becoming unjustifiable to purchase an Internal Combustion Engine vehicle as opposed to an EV.

It is a fact that a Tesla will save you money on fuel costs, maintenance, and depreciation.",9926,True,1645567291.0,2022-02-22 23:01:31,0,28,Gamersville101,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/syzoi2/why_the_world_needs_electric_vehicles_badly_in/,True,0.29,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,t4odz9,,I spent February renting and driving enthusiast cars.,"There are countless videos on each of these cars but you never know the full picture until you actually live with one. I rented each car for 4-10 days and drove ~400 miles per rental. I'll tell you what I thought of each car with 2-3 sentences, and then pros and cons just below if you want to know a little more.

#**Lexus LC500**
This car is theatrical in every aspect. Engine sound, interior and exterior design, even the gauge cluster. But it's a large car for something trying to be a sports car and there's almost no space to put anything inside. I can't imagine paying $100,000+ for a car this big with less storage than other GTs.

**Pros:**
- Futuristic styling with theatrical interior and exterior.  
- Incredible muscle car engine note that pipes into the cabin very well.  

**Cons:**
- Absolutely terrible infotainment you won't be able to (easily) replace.  
- The smallest trunk for a car this size. The packaging is questionable.   
- Not as fun to drive as other cars in this price point. Feels boaty.  

#**The Ioniq 5**  
My second rental. My first non-Tesla EV. This may just be the best value EV on the market with a sticker price $10,000 below a Model Y but with the same size, similar range, and excellent roomy interior. The biggest downside with my week of ownership was Electrify America where I had to find a new stall to park **FIVE** different times as each stall I pulled into had a unique problem. It actually took me longer to park and troubleshoot than it did to charge.

**Pros:**  
- Gorgeous spacious interior that makes anything else feel cramped.   
- Really fast charging. A 15-20 minute stop is truly all you need.  
- The closest thing to what Tesla provides in ownership experience with a range that went beyond what was claimed. I loved this car.  

**Cons:**  
- Start/Stop Button. It's an EV! I shouldn't have to tell it to turn the ""engine"" off.   
- There's a frunk that just shouldn't be there. You can maybe fit a laptop or a sack lunch.",4923,True,1646185369.0,2022-03-02 02:42:49,255,78,asimo3089,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/t4odz9/i_spent_february_renting_and_driving_enthusiast/,True,0.93,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,t7kfyf,,US Ford Fiesta ST: 2 year ownership review,"I had written a long reply yesterday to someone about my experience with my Fiesta ST and was told I should submit a post based on it. 

I bought my [2018 Ford Fiesta ST](https://imgur.com/a/FI9agfu) just over 2 years ago, 2 months before the start of the pandemic. 

My previous car was a [7th generation Honda Accord V6 6 speed coupe](https://imgur.com/a/poQPCYO) which I had for just over 10 years.

My Accord ran as well the day I sold it as the day I bought it, my major reasons for getting rid of it was that I wanted more practical cargo space, a bit more fuel efficiency and most importantly for me at the time, 4 doors. 

Another major reason for buying my Fiesta ST at that point was that Ford had discontinued the Fiesta (and all of their other cars except the Mustang) after the 2019 model year. If I was to buy a Fiesta, I wanted to buy one new as I had seen so many owners modify their cars. 

 I had been interested in the Fiesta ST after seeing it featured by various car journalists I follow. ^[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRu_iQUVNtg),[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10L-WFsVaw0),[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-4OIxm3XaE),[4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU9obX0J5VM),[5](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15089257/2017-ford-fiesta-st-instrumented-test-review/) 

I still spent several months doing test drives of all the hot hatches available to me before making my decision. Cars I tested included the Focus ST, Focus RS, GTI, Golf R, Civic Type R, Veloster N & Hyundai Elantra GT Sport. 

I ultimately went with the Fiesta ST due to its size, fun at normal driving speeds (I drive mostly under 60 mph, predominantly on city/suburban roads with a bit of highway) and competitive price. 

The cars which came closest for me were the GTI & Veloster N. I rejected the GTI because my mechanic warned me about higher repair costs & the Veloster N due to it only having 3 doors.",6921,True,1646519170.0,2022-03-05 23:26:10,94,56,cocoagiant,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/t7kfyf/us_ford_fiesta_st_2_year_ownership_review/,True,0.9,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,tdpkn4,,You have to be crazy not to own Tesla,"At just below $800, it's at the price it was on October last year. Except this month we have a gigafactory coming online and a second gigafactory next month. They're also surpassing analyst expectations on earnings and deliveries every single quarter. Q1 will be no exception.

Current gas prices have only accelerated the demand for Teslas, and will likely continue to. Tesla can freely raise their prices and still sell every vehicle they make.

Tesla won't grow that much, given rising input costs, increasing inflation. Also it is a lot easier to scale from 100,000 to 1m, if you factories can produce that much. It is another to get from 1m to 10m -  given the need for new factories. We see how long Berlin takes to open.

# Company Description

Silicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power data centers, mobile devices, SSDs, autos, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMO’s products. Micron accounts for 25% of SIMO's revenues.

# Thesis

SIMO is significantly undervalued at current levels, getting caught in the indiscriminate market-wide selling over Q1 that has brought semis in to bottom barrel valuations.

This has created an AMAZING opportunity to not only double dip, but also enjoy even stronger tailwinds from even better fundamentals than we had in Q4!

I want to expedite the delivery of this DD, and I'll be beefing this section up throughout the day. For now, let me reiterate my Q4 investment thesis:

This is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering).

What do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off. Close your eyes and feel the experience of starting the boosters, lifting off, and gradually accelerating to space.",8358,True,1647972895.0,2022-03-22 19:14:55,8,7,BigDaddyDLo,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tk9a44/siliconmotion_of_the_ocean_mega_memory_upside/,True,1.0,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,tklbaw,,V2G Tech Bridging The Gap Between EV and Diesel Cost In an Untapped Market,"Full disclosure: I retained a small position in $PTRA in my Roth IRA. Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor. Do your own DD as always.

I want to start a discussion on **V2G** as I think it has reached the turning point in commercialization of V2G tech and its unique but perfect marriage with electric school bus.

&#x200B;

**What is V2G:**

V2G or Vehicle-to-Grid is using electric vehicle specially equipped with bidirectional charging to take energy from the grid when the cost is low such as overnight and selling the energy back to the grid during peak hours when the electric cost is highest. It is important that the EV has a lot of energy left, ie: short routes and mostly unused hours/days. School buses have short routes, spend most of the day not in use and have many months without service particularly in the Summer assuming 180 days in a typical school year. Most electric vehicles can't do V2G. For example, not only my Tesla can't do bidirectional charging due to limitation, even if it could there just isn't enough 'juice' left to sell back to the grid at the end of the day because of high mileage.

&#x200B;

**Successful use of V2G in commercial settings:**

Thomas Built Buses just announced a [long term agreement](https://electrek.co/2022/03/18/electric-school-buses-are-reaching-cost-parity-with-diesel-and-a-california-district-will-deploy-one-of-the-largest-e-bus-fleets-in-the-state/) to 2025 with Highland Electric to sell a fleet of the electric bus Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley powered by Proterra's 226kWh battery and drivetrain. The 226kWh battery is the largest in the industry for school buses and has the capacity that is more than 16 times that of a Tesla Powerwall battery. This agreement is expanding on their previous fleet order of 326 electric bus in February of 2021 after Highland spent the past year successfully confirming that it is profitable using V2G on the Jouley electric school bus.",8238,True,1648007482.0,2022-03-23 04:51:22,1,3,GrandmasterKane,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/tklbaw/v2g_tech_bridging_the_gap_between_ev_and_diesel/,True,0.67,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

comment,tmj8dn,tmj8dn,,"Because it’s not going to be perfect.

People who buy Teslas (myself included when I did) have to come to terms with the fact that you’re getting performance, tech, and range per dollar, not luxury per dollar. 

The Plaid is a flawless example - it has crazy performance, great tech, and solid range at a lower price than say, Lucid, where you’re getting all that plus better materials and build quality. But a Lucid Air that comes close(ish) to Plaid performance costs tens of thousands more. Reasonably so. 

Now my .02 after owning my Model 3 is that Tesla level quality shouldn’t exist on a $50k Model 3, but at the same time, $50k on a BMW 3 series with better build/interior doesn’t net you the tech the Tesla has, or the acceleration, or the fact that it’s an EV and not ICE. If Tesla wanted to do all they do and then have better build and materials, it would cost more. They *very* clearly build to hit a price point, and would rather chase the “cool” things instead of actual quality per dollar. 

The people who say “Tesla quality is awful” - yes it is, but you’re buying a full size sedan or SUV that does 0-60 quicker than a Veyron, has excellent tech, and hauls the whole family for $130k. Where else are you going to get all that *plus* great quality at that price point? You won’t, and you can’t.

It all comes down to what you value. You can’t get everything *and* get it cheap. Hating Tesla quality is reasonable.

post,ttbqoj,,The Electre SUV might actually be a great Lotus.,"Wait, hear me out! I can explain!

We all know that Lotus, as a car brand, stands for very specific things. The mantra of “simplify, then add lightness” is beyond legendary. Lotus never stood for gigantic amounts of power and torque; straight line speed was never quite their thing as much as handling was (I know I'm ignoring things such as the Lotus Carlton but please focus on the point I am trying to make). Over the years Lotus developed a reputation for flawless handling, which was the result of perfect chassis balance, beautiful suspension, amazingly communicative steering, innovative ideas, and a relentless search for lightness. So, when a few years ago Lotus decided to introduce the Evija, people rightfully expressed concerns as to whether that car truly followed the ethos of what Lotus represents. After roll a 3000lb+, 2000hp monster machine doesn't really sound like something Lotus would do. And now, horror of horrors, Lotus is building a 2 tonne, 600-1000hp electric SUV. This is something that will cause many to be inclined to think that Lotus has lost its way. 

However, I do not think that is right:

Many think of the Evija, as a heavy car unworthy of bearing the Lotus name plate. But I think that is a big mistake. See, the Evija might weigh twice as much as an Elise, but it is in fact astonishingly light. In fact, compared to other EV hypercars it is an absolute featherweight. Take the Rimac Nevera, its closest competitor: that car is 400 kg heavier than the Lotus. The idea that Lotus managed to build a car with that big a battery, that much power, which weighs so little, AND is road legal is absolutely incredible. With four-wheel torque vectoring, perfect chassis balance, incredible aerodynamics, and an advanced suspension system, that car is a technological tour de force that strives, in true Lotus fashion, to be as light as possible. If that doesn't sound like Lotus to you, I do not know what does.",3658,True,1648766348.0,2022-04-01 00:39:08,2,5,The_Dyff,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/ttbqoj/the_electre_suv_might_actually_be_a_great_lotus/,True,0.53,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Hertz said Polestar cars would be available beginning this spring in Europe and later in 2022 in North America and Australia.

The Florida-based rental car company said that it would initially order the Polestar 2 sedan. Hertz shares were up 1.75% in premarket trading Monday.

Hertz in October announced its order to purchase 100,000 electric cars from Tesla Inc, primarily the EV maker's Model 3.

In March, Hertz added Tesla's mid-size SUV Model Y to its electric vehicle fleet, according to the car rental firm's website.

Polestar, which was founded by China's Geely and Volvo Cars, is set to merge with special purpose acquisition company: Gores Guggenheim Inc, this year.

The Hertz partnership ""will bring the amazing experience of driving an electric car to a wider audience, satisfying a broad variety of our mutual customers' short- and longer-term mobility requirements,"" Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said in a statement.

post,u464i5,,Customers’ needs in the B2B-world,"**B2B is an incorrect abbreviation. H2H is more correct**

On 28 June 2021, Bloomberg reported that for the first time in the history of the humankind, a human was fired by a machine (or, rather, by an algorithm). It was Amazon’s driver who, as the algorithm concluded, hadn’t met his targets. The algorithm wished the driver all the best. 

If you want to sell your products on Amazon, you probably won’t need to negotiate with a human being. In Amazon they have built an effective system where algorithms handle all the processes for merchants. You need to follow the instructions, and soon your products will be on Amazon’s virtual showcase shelf. But Amazon's case is an exception so far, and dealing with less digitalized companies will involve good old human-to-human interactions.

When I lecture in business schools, and when it comes to customers' needs topic, I am often asked the same question: ""Does the word ""needs"" make any sense in B2B industries? Isn't it only about the B2C world? Shouldn’t we replace the word “needs” with “requirements”?”. A direct comparison of two purchasing approaches – an ordinary person buying a smartphone or a car and a professional procurement manager ordering cold-rolled steel or chips for their plant – looks bizarre. But that's only at first glance.

If you or your employees negotiate with a customer, and if this customer is an official representing a company, it is still a human-to-human (H2H) interaction. Your counterpart is a human being, and they can stop being one even on duty. People can’t leave their personalities outside the office’s door. On the one hand, they are financial managers, sales representatives, and top executives. On the other hand, they are women and men with fears, superstitions, dreams, and hopes.

post,u8ka1h,,On Tesla's valuation (Part Deux),"Five months ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/), breaking down Tesla's hotly debated valuation to determine whether it's really as cheap as Tesla bulls say, or as expensive as most of the rest of the sub thinks it is.

After yesterday's earnings report, it seems like my analysis has already been proven incorrect, and I felt it would be worth having another look at it.

For those who don't like reading, I will again explain how I got to my numbers. If you don't like reading, skip straight to ""The Numbers""

------------------------------

**The method**

While trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap might rise slightly higher today, let's use a market cap of $1T to determine if Tesla really deserves to be a trillion dollar company.

------------------------------

**The trends**

In terms of revenue (TTM), Tesla had grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021 in my last analysis. After Q1, that has grown to $62,190M, with Q1 being a 87% YoY increase.

In terms of operating margin, Tesla had grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021. After Q1, that has grown to 19.2%, equalling market leader Ferrari.

In terms of GAAP net income (TTM), Tesla had grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,468M after Q3 2021. After Q1, this has grown to $8,399M, with Q1 being a 658% YoY increased.

------------------------------

**The future**

Last time, I said the following:

> Obviously Tesla won't be able to maintain such a high growth rate. The net income figure is heavily distorted by their low profitability in 2020, and their margins may suffer somewhat as they start to ramp up the two new factories that they are building.",8827,True,1650536252.0,2022-04-21 12:17:32,48,111,Ehralur,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8ka1h/on_teslas_valuation_part_deux/,True,0.85,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

If this is changing now, then that is HUGELY positive for Tesla. They are the only automaker currently making money on EVs even though their cars are already cheaper than their competitors' models with equal specs.

Tesla has WAY more pricing power, so if EVs are changing from a toy for rich people to a car for every day people, that's a huge problem for those other automakers you mentioned.

As for everything else you said, I'm pretty sure you don't even believe it yourself so I'm not gonna get into that.

Remember, how it was proven that the news lied? Lets go Brandon is the exposure of a lie that a CNN reporter said at a NASCAR race... CNN news reporters are taught to lie as a way of spinning the news. We know this, everyone knows this.

Remember how the news censor?  For a while, even some of my family didn't know of how massive liberal anti Christian censorship and discrimination is rampant.  I'm one of the literal best software engineers on Earth and worked on the first self driving cars at CMU, remember I coded since I was 4?  The reason I never got hired has nothing to do with my skill.  It's 100% discrimination against Christians by liberals who's crony culture embraces atheism and fight against the notion of God.  They think they're keeping secrets by censoring, nah, but it took a while for everyone to find out what I knew in 2018..

We ALL know the news lies by now. We ALL know they censor, and if you don't it can be easily proven to you and we can catch you up to speed.  So the conclusion is: If you accept the evil that the news lies to you, and you accept the evil that they censor you: Why do you let them tell you nothing goes on in secret that they don't tell you about?  There's more evils than censorship and lying going on. They use the tools of censorship and lying to keep it hidden... So Elon Musk buying Twitter and letting Christians speak again is awwweeeesome! Let freedom of speech be real again!

post,udru31,,Customers’ needs and a b2b-portal,"About ten years ago, I was a CEO of a plant. We sold our products to distributors, and there were more than 90 of them in several countries. They sent us orders the way they preferred – by email, fax (yes, we had to keep an old fax machine in the office), phone, or even SMS. A small army of clerks worked in the spacious open space in our office. They received the orders, registered them, and converted them into the form fitted for our ERP system. They also kept the distributors informed about everything concerning their orders. Every time I signed an annual payroll, my heart bled – so much work without any visible added value! 

And then our IT department built up a b2b online portal for the distributors. Since then, they could log in to their personal account and see the statuses of the placed orders, place a new one, reconcile their debts, receive additional information on the products, etc. We presented this hi-tech solution to the distributors in a solemn ceremony, with champaign and oysters, and it seemed to me that they were impressed – at least, they nodded and shook my hand.

post,udtyqm,,"Why I’m long on long read DNA sequencing ($PACB, LON:$ONT)","I work in the biotech field and want to lay out why the 2022 biotech sell-off has created an unparalleled opportunity to buy cheaply into technology leaders in a growing field. Specifically, I want to talk about two companies involved in DNA sequencing: the US-listed Pacific Biosciences ($PACB) and the UK-listed Oxford Nanopore Technologies (LON:$ONT). These are household names for people working in biotech but not widely known outside of the field. I will refer to them as PacBio and ONT in the main text below.

**TL;DR:** PacBio and ONT are significantly undervalued leaders in long read DNA sequencing. Together they hold a duopoly in the long read sequencing market, with sizable technology-based moats that even the sequencing Goliath Illumina ($ILMN) with 80% market share has never been able to overcome. In the last 6 months, PacBio has lost 80% of its value and ONT has lost 45% of its value, providing excellent entry points. Bucking the stock price decline, in 2021, revenues grew 65% for PacBio and 94% for ONT as these companies scale up. Together PacBio and ONT own less than a 10% share of the DNA sequencing market, which is currently worth $5.8B. But both their market share as well as the total addressable market are likely to grow rapidly over the next ten years. Going long on PacBio and ONT therefore has a high probability of yielding a 10X return on investment.

# What is DNA sequencing?

For those who went to school before the Human Genome Project started in 1990 and those who forgot their high school biology, DNA sequencing is the process of reading out the nucleic acid sequence of a molecule of DNA. You know that stuff inside all of our cells which encodes our genetic blueprint. Importantly, this DNA is rich in valuable information. Some of the most important types of information we can extract from DNA sequence are:

* genetic mutations that contribute to disease like cancer and other traits
* genetic relationships to other sequences (i.e.",24432,True,1651149297.0,2022-04-28 14:34:57,147,81,WorldFamousAstronaut,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/udtyqm/why_im_long_on_long_read_dna_sequencing_pacb/,True,0.86,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,uk7b5v,,What Virgin Galactic (SPCE) needs to do to actually become a successful space tourism company,"Lets face it, Richard Branson is not good at building a manufacturing/engineering company. Its been almost 20 years since SpaceShipOne first flew, and yet VG only has *one* operational vehicle, VSS Unity, in 2022. Imagine SpaceX, which was founded in 2002, had only manufactured one Falcon 9 since its creation. How does anyone expect VG to be successful when they have clearly, and repeatedly shown, that they are horrible at manufacturing?

What is Richard Branson known for and good at? Branson is a genius when it comes to branding and providing luxurious experiences. This is his gift. He isn't Elon Musk, and he quite clearly isn't able to attract the engineering talent needed to scale manufacturing as is needed like Elon can.

So how can Branson and VG as a whole actually create a successful business model? Instead of being a space ship manufacturing company *and* a space tourism company, they need to become just a space tourism company. For an example, airlines like Delta, United, Southwest, etc. don't manufacture the planes they operate. They purchase or lease them from Boeing and Airbus. This wasn't always the case. Up until 1934, the manufacturing companies also provided airline services. Then, the US government forced these companies to separate these operations. You can read about it here:[ http://avstop.com/history/needregulations/act1934.htm](http://avstop.com/history/needregulations/act1934.htm).

Could we see this happen in the commercial space flight sector as well? Could SpaceX in the commercial space flight sector be the equivalent to what Boeing and Airbus are in the commercial air flight sector today? Could Virgin Galactic then be the equivalent to Delta airlines, United airlines, or its sister company, Virgin Atlantic?

How would this play out, exactly?

post,uric8y,,Idea behind Stock Compensation at Tech Firms," 

This is just a curious take of how does stock compensations really work from an employee and business owner stand point?

Looking at [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi/) the salaries are divided into 3 divisions: base, stock and bonus  
These are my assumption:

Base is given to employees after dividing it by 12 and paid monthly  
Bonus might be quarterly, biyearly or yearly  
And stock has a lock-in period for x number of months.

Considering Meta which has a payout of 25% for 4 years, does it indicate one can cash out at year end (or at the end of the month)?

What is the benefit of the company to issue shares instead of cash? Doesn't the employee have a lot to lose in case he/she switches companies, as the stock payout gets accumulated? Isnt the employee at loss in case the company goes through its downs, as he/she has control over its work and not in the success of the entire company, which is what he works for?  
Also how does company **GENERATE** those shares? Share is the proportional ownership of the company. During an FPO, the company issues new batch of shares **from the market** from retail, institutions and anchor investors? Where does the company generate the equity to pass it on to the employee?

Going by this article as Elon Musk too is an employee of a company [Here’s Why Elon Musk Was Really The Highest-Paid CEO In 2020 (forbes.com)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2021/05/06/elon-musk-made-billions-in-2020-every-other-ceo-made-millions/?sh=4e9d127d6f93) , it says ""In all, the pay package entitles Musk to options that will give him the right to buy a total of 101.2 million Tesla shares at a split-adjusted price of $70 per share.

&#x200B;

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in an interview in Brazil on Friday that he expects Tesla to have a completely human-free car in about a year.

&#x200B;

Musk is currently visiting South America. It met with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Friday to discuss using SpaceX technology to help provide internet to schools in rural areas of the country, among other issues, and to help monitor deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.

This isn't the first time Musk has made rhetoric. As early as December 2015, he predicted that he would achieve ""full autonomy"" within two years, but the schedule has since been readjusted several times.

&#x200B;

But Musk's timeline isn't entirely impossible this time around, and Tesla is working hard to make it happen through its FSDBeta program.

&#x200B;

In the previous earnings call, Musk claimed that Tesla FSD will make significant progress this year.

post,v1ar13,,Rented an EV6 - comparing it to my Model 3,"I rented a Kia EV6 long range RWD (Wind edition I think) off of turo since my tesla model 3 is STILL at the service center (12 days and counting) and I wasn't given a loaner or rental credits.

Overall I'm extremely impressed with the Kia.  Its build quality and road noise levels are FAR superior to my tesla model 3.  Even though it wasn't the GT line, it was still very quick and fun.  It felt bigger than my model 3 for sure, and harder to tell where the corners of the car were, but perhaps I'd get used to that over time.  Feels more like you're in an SUV than it looks in photos.

Its driver assist tech is almost as good as autopilot.  Its navigation system is not as good as tesla's, but apple carplay helps solve that. 

It seems like tesla achieves their range advantage by really skimping on noise insulation and materials.  After experiencing the Kia, I think I prefer a quieter ride and a little less range.  The kia also is much more forgiving on rough pavement, which is most of america, but still felt very sporty.

The main area that my tesla is far better is  - driving position.  I'm 5'9"" and if I put the EV6's wheel in a comfortable place, it completely blocks all the info in the instrument cluster and all I can see is the useless car animation graphic.   In order to see all the important info, I'd have to raise the wheel up to a goofy high level like I'm driving a school bus.  This seems like such a massive design flaw and I can't believe it made it to production.  Reading others' reviews, it seems this is a huge problem for some owners, and no problem at all for others.  I wish the wheel would go lower to be more comfortable too.  There also wasn't anywhere to rest either elbow with my hands on the wheel. 

As poor as the quality has been on my model 3, the driving position is the best of any car I've ever owned.   I won't be buying another tesla due to it's quality, but due to the EV6's poor driving ergonomics, I know I won't be buying one of those either.",2172,True,1653947205.0,2022-05-30 23:46:45,113,102,teslacometrue,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/v1ar13/rented_an_ev6_comparing_it_to_my_model_3/,True,0.9,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

comment,v1itrt,v1itrt,,"I’m the opposite of a Tesla fanboy, but what large NYSE listed car manufacturers aren’t down significantly? Ford is down 50%, GM 40%, and even Toyota and Ferrari have been down close to 30%.

Tesla gets the headlines because of its overall valuation, but on percentage terms, it’s only down marginally higher than other large car stocks.

Having said that, investors priced Tesla at its peak like it’s the Apple of car stocks. The car industry is vastly different, and I’m of the opinion that the new Toyota EV (the Toyota BZ4X) is going to fly off the shelves. Not because it’s the best EV or has the best performance figures, but because Toyota has some of the most loyal customers in the world. It’s perceived as the most reliable and trustworthy brand, and it’s why the Corolla and RAV4 are the two highest selling cars by volume in the world. The Corolla isn’t the best car in its class, but everyone that buys it knows what they’re getting (reliability, ease of use, build quality, resale value, good capped priced servicing etc).

Tesla don’t even make the best EV in the world. The best EV according to various 2021 car of the year awards is the Kia EV6. 

The interesting aspect to Tesla that I’m waiting to see play out is the polarising views of Musk himself. For the most part, he’d successfully imaged himself as a tech pioneer like Gates or Jobs, but unlike them, he hasn’t been able to remain as apolitical. In fact he’s doing the opposite.",1722,True,1653989413.0,2022-05-31 11:30:13,75,0,kitchen_masturbator,business,https://reddit.com/r/business/comments/v1itrt/tesla_short_sellers_have_made_82_billion_betting/ian70vm/,True,,2022,both,search,False,False,0,ian70vm
post,v290yl,,"CA to CT, 3100 miles in 5 days, for $120: first big EV road trip","**Quick stats**

* '22 Model 3 LR AWD, Aero wheels
* 3100 miles \* 227 Wh / mi = 704 kWh
* \~50% DC fast charging, \~50% free Level 2 charging
* DC fast charging \~350 kWh at $.34 / kWh = $120 ($0.038 / mi)
* \~65 mph average speed, around 10h per day driving

&#x200B;

**Overview**

I've crossed the country more times than I can remember, but this was my first time doing so in an EV. And it was awesome! High flight prices inspired me to see how little I could spend while still completing the drive in 5 days (about as fast as I'd typically do it solo).

Essentially, this ended up forming the question: If I knew I had access to e.g. an 8 kW free charger for the whole route, how many miles could I drive in a day, and what was the optimal speed for getting the most out of BOTH charging and driving? Many python scripts later, and I found that charging on average 16 kW and driving 65 - 70 mph would allow me to cover 750 miles per day, more than enough to get me coast to coast in 5 days.

As an aside, if your road trip involves days with <400 mi driving, it's not so difficult to drive for free indefinitely with the right car, assuming you can find decent free chargers.

**Method**

I drove around 10 hours per day and followed the ABCs of EV road trips when not driving: always be charging. So where, when, and for how long?

* Make certain that you can charge overnight. Arrive on a low battery, leave with a full one, and try not to sit idle for longer than necessary.
* Finding a fast free charger (>10 kW in my case) meant I tried to stick around as long as I reasonably could. Grab food, maybe nap, go for a walk, etc. Unless you're driving 16 hours per day, you'll have to stop anyway and might as well do so optimally.
* Try to optimize where cheap DC fast chargers are with where you can charge for free. Gas prices are mostly consistent within a few hundred miles, but DC charger rates can vary by 50% or more. Don't get stuck paying $0.",4528,True,1654059317.0,2022-06-01 06:55:17,34,13,TheMagic1415926535,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/v290yl/ca_to_ct_3100_miles_in_5_days_for_120_first_big/,True,0.86,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

comment,v290yl,v290yl,,"Lots of patience lol

Coming from the ICE world it's a weird feeling to drive 70 in an 80 mph limit. But there weren't many cars and I just kept to the right. I also mentally prepared myself to drive about 10 hours at 65 - 70 mph, rather than try to beat the navigation's ETA.

Regarding efficiency, definitely be aware of headwinds. A 15 mph headwind (not unheard of along I-40) will give driving at 85 mph the efficiency of driving at 100 (nearly), and that reduces efficiency way more than you'd expect.

Another thing you can do is find a tractor trailer going a comfortable speed, then use Autopilot to stay \~3 car lengths back (Autopilot setting, which is much greater than 3 car lengths in practice).

post,vm3djk,,"Ford’s MachE – a examination of Tesla’s competition, with $TSLA implications","
TL/DR upfront:

Upcoming EV competition is *the* driving DD behind the Tesla bear narrative: that EV competition will show up à market competition will drive EV prices (and therefore $TSLA margins) down to industry-norms. I think this reasoning is flawed. Ford’s unprofitability with the MachE provides a window into what the competition is facing, and why Tesla is *very likely* to retain supply capped demand and see robust gross margin growth--insulated from the effects of market competition—for several years (until \~ 2026-2028). 

\---- 

Argument:

**Fords issues with EV profitabili**ty (link:  [Ford CFO says inflation has erased Mustang Mach-E profits, but isn't hurting demand (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/ford-cfo-says-inflation-has-erased-mustang-mach-e-profits-but-isnt-hurting-demand.html) ) i**s a** **PROXY** **for legacy auto’s outlook writ large.** 

Ford’s ‘Tesla Killer’ is their Mach E, which is a BEV (full battery) crossover SUV. However, recently Ford announced that they get zero profit from sales of their Mach E. Price information is below. 

* The ‘Standard Range’ RWD (68kwh battery, 230 miles EPA range, the lowest $ base model) is $42,895 before dealer markups and delivery fees
* The ‘Extended Range’ (88kwh, 300 miles EPA, the lowest $ long range model) is $52,000 before dealer/delivery

Fords lack of Mach-E profitability is VERY interesting because the car is highly priced while also benefiting from several cost-lowering factors:

* $7,500 U.S. federal EV subsidy (Ford has yet to hit the 200,000 vehicle cap for the $7500, at which point it gradually decreases). Tesla buyers do not qualify for any EV tax credits right now. 
* Made in Mexico with cheaper, non-unionized labor 
* Usage of large pouch-style batteries, which are cheaper but lower-quality
* A more battery-efficient Car form-factor (as compared to a truck), meaning less batteries for a desired range and, therefore, lower cost of production.",6637,True,1656357248.0,2022-06-27 21:14:08,503,492,IS_JOKE_COMRADE,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/vm3djk/fords_mache_a_examination_of_teslas_competition/,True,0.79,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

How can you make this argument for Tesla (which has much more mature manufacturing lines for their EV models - ie less room for optimization), but not apply it to legacy autos. 

If Ford, is at zero margin on their first pass at this, I'd actually consider that a good thing for ford.

Either way, autos will always be low margin enterprises. I would look for Tesla's margins to come down in-line with everyone else. The only way they avoid this is if they get the same cult following that Apple gets; which is possible, but they're already priced to take over the world, so I wouldn't invest personally.

At the San Mateo facility, hundreds of employees were tasked with labeling videos from the company’s cars in order to improve their driver assistance systems, marketed as Autopilot. Bloomberg first reported on the office closure and layoffs.

Two employees impacted by the layoffs told CNBC on Tuesday that they knew Tesla’s lease was approaching its end. The workers asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak on the matter.

Yes, but because it is a bear market, and many stocks are likely to make new lows in the coming months.

On the 1 year chart:

- TSLA is flat (up 0.6%)

- AMZN is down 36%

- MSFT is down 4%

- AAPL is up 2%

- GOOG is down 11%

Q2 will be a delivery miss (because of China lockdowns, supply chain issues) but it is unclear how much of that is already priced in.  It will probably be TSLA's worst quarter in 2020-2030.

post,vnxe9o,,TSLA seems to be priced fairly right now,"Apologies for making yet another tesla post but I feel like this is worth discussing.

At the time of writing this post TSLA is worth $685.47 with a market cap of $710B. I don't own any shares of Tesla at all. 

My claim is that at this price and point in time the stock seems to be priced fairly and arguably is a pretty decent buy.  

My reasoning: 

1. Extreme growth: They have a 51% revenue CAGR starting with the realease of the model s in 2013 up until last year. This year they will probably have another 50% growth and <<probably>> another 50% in 2023. The point is that so far over the long run TSLA has grown extremely quickly and consistently. They will also have new models such as Semi, cybertruck and roadster arriving <<probably>> next year. AND they sell their cars with excellent margins. So their growth is very sustainable. 
2. Diverse and unique side businesses: As of this moment tesla gets the vast majority of its revenue and profit from selling cars, thats undeniable. But they have a lot of aspirations. Firstly, energy storage is going to be cruicial in transitioning the world to sustainable energy and tesla is at the forefront of this industry and are therefore in a prime position to capitalize on that. Secondly tesla is dabbling with insurance and juding by their lates report that business unit seems to be breaking even and soon will become profitable. It has only launched in a few states so far and there is a lot of room to grow. Solar shignles and solar in general is also another potential area for growth although tesla doesn't seem to be prioritizing it.  
3. Autonomy: Elon has many times over estimated his own timelines so this point is a little weak BUT if tesla does indeed manage to actually get FSD working properly (im guessing 2025 is the year where they start driving tens of thousands of kilometers without any issues) then tesla is poised to make a ridiculous amount of money.",3838,True,1656556752.0,2022-06-30 04:39:12,0,69,Mr_Axelg,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vnxe9o/tsla_seems_to_be_priced_fairly_right_now/,True,0.29,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

I'm not sure exactly what number to cherrypick from what report to get the conversation started here.

Obviously, most of us are not professional analysts, so we are pretty far from ""the best person for the job"" when it comes to giving an educated opinion on such a robust economic topic.

2021 earnings: 208.49

2022 earnings estimate: 225

2023 earnings estimate: 240

Why are S&P earnings estimated to grow 8% from 2021 -> 2022, and 6.66% 2022 -> 2023? If markets are forward looking... why does it feel like there's still a bit of wiggle room for future earnings estimates to be adjusted downwards? Why are markets being optimistic instead of pessimistic?

I pulled up the top 100 companies of the S&P by earnings TTM (not EPS, EPS * # shares outstanding). Top 100 companies make up 65% of the market cap and 73% of the earnings for the S&P500

post,vs6eou,,Short term review of IONIQ 5 SE RWD and comparison with Model 3 & Y,"TL;DR : 8/10 Car, competitive with Tesla offerings but also some very mind baffling design decisions. Good buy if $5K cheaper than Model 3.

My wife got a ridiculously good early lease return offer for her 2020 Leaf SV so we took it. She did need another car, and we decided to take advantage of the federal EV tax credit as well as CVRP to get an IONIQ 5. Note that if these were not available (Tesla is eligible for neither now) or if Tesla had no wait time, we probably would have just bought a Model 3 SR+. We currently still own a 2021 Model Y LR, previously owned a 2018 Model 3 LR RWD, and have driven a 2017 Model S 75D quite a bit as well as the Leaf we just returned and have test driven most of the other EV offerings out there, so we have a broad range of EV experience.

MSRP was 45K, with a 4k markup and a 3K mandatory service contract for a total of 53K+Tax. We will get 9.5K back in tax credits and rebates for an effective price of 44K. Dealers playing games made the overall experience annoying after being spoiled by one button ordering with Tesla.

Driving and Handling 9/10:

I'm not going to compare 0-60 to the Model Y AWD as that would be unfair. Compared to the Model 3 RWD, the initial throttle is much more gentle, with more progression in the mid and end throttle curve. The Ioniq is more gentle and comfortable especially for family and passengers, at the cost of responsiveness, even in the ""sport"" driving setting. The Ioniq breaks traction easier when accelerating.

The suspension on the Ioniq however is much softer and easier on bumps than the Y.  This is one of the biggest complaints on 3/Ys and I think the comfort outweighs the loss in responsiveness. Minimum turning radius is much tighter than the Y.

At max strength, regenerative braking is stronger than on the Leaf and weaker than on a Tesla. So the stopping distance and comfort when using only regen to brake is nice middle ground.",9889,True,1657050423.0,2022-07-05 21:47:03,23,69,EuthanizeArty,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/vs6eou/short_term_review_of_ioniq_5_se_rwd_and/,True,0.73,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,w19mwb,,Twitter's filing in Delaware court shows Musk was actively sabotaging Twitter's business and the acquisition deal,"[The filing](https://www.wlrk.com/docs/76660099_Final-Verified-Complaint.pdf)  is a profile of Musk's MO: he's impulsive, petulant, and bullying; he  reneges on his word constantly; and uses his money & power to get  what he wants. Unfortunately for him, [Bret Taylor](https://twitter.com/btaylor/status/1546965769983889409) and Twitter's lawyers have an airtight contract which Musk (typically)  signed back in April without much thought. And despite repeated,  flagrant violations of the agreement by Musk over the next 3 months,  Twitter has abided by it. So Elon is now up shit creek without a  baguette.

Highlights:

* *""On  April 25, 2022, Musk\[\] agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in  cash, for a total of about $44 billion. That price, presented by Musk on  a take-it-or-leave-it basis in an unsolicited public offer, represented  a 38% premium over Twitter’s unaffected share price. The other terms  Musk offered and agreed to were, as he touted, “seller friendly.” There  is no financing contingency and no diligence condition. The deal is  backed by airtight debt and equity commitments. Musk has personally  committed $33.5 billion.""* (Sections 3, 4) In other words, he threw  money at Twitter, and was so confident of winning that he signed the  deal without doing any due diligence and basically guaranteeing the  financing himself.
* *""Musk’s  exit strategy is a model of hypocrisy. One of the chief reasons Musk  cited\[\] for wanting to buy Twitter was to rid it of the “\[c\]rypto spam”  he viewed as a “major blight on the user experience.” But when the  market declined and the fixed-price deal became less attractive, Musk  shifted his narrative, suddenly demanding “verification” that spam was  not a serious problem on Twitter’s platform, and claiming a burning need  to conduct “diligence” he had expressly forsworn.""* (Section 7) Due diligence is a process you do before entering into a contract not after.

post,w2yhd9,,Tesla vs WeWork,"Just finished watching the Hulu WeWork documentary, and throughout the entire film, all I could think was ""How is Tesla not just like WeWork??"" The parallels between the two are a lot in my opinion. 

Summarizing real quick and briefly the WeWork documentary:

- Adam shows up in 2010 after the financial crisis. This was a time when people were being a bit greedy, betting on Tech companies a lot of money in hopes of incredible returns or finding that next ""unicorn"". 
- Adam uses his charisma to ensnare people into working for him and investing in his dream, a ""revolution in the workplace"" that would ""forever change the human interaction"" when it comes to business and maybe even societal expectations about work / life balance. Telling people that everyone is a ""creator"" and all this other spiritual stuff. 
- WeWork had a fairly straightforward business model. The company would sign long-term leases on office space (from Adam after he purchased the buildings himself) subdivide it into smaller work areas, and then rent those out to freelancers or small businesses on a short-term basis. 
- The innovation here was the different way of presenting work space to people - changing the overall aesthetic. That is it!! 
- WeWork uses all types of tactics (gets attractive young people, booze, free snacks in offices, the inspirational mantras, etc...) to entice people to work for them or open their offices in WeWork locations, or invest in the company. Adam essentially creates a cult of personality around him, being all about “bringing people together” in the “spirit of We."" He cashed in the fact that many people are looking for ""purpose"" in life. 
- Adam Neumann insisted that WeWork was going to be huge, and it had something to do with technology. “So we’re definitely not a real-estate company,” he said to a skeptical television interviewer. “We are a community of creators” who “leverage technology to connect people. . . . And it’s a new way of working.",4811,True,1658252127.0,2022-07-19 19:35:27,0,51,SilentBob890,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w2yhd9/tesla_vs_wework/,True,0.5,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

post,w56glz,,Tesla Earnings - some perspective,"Tesla rallied 10% yeterday, post earnings. A move we have not seen in a while. Tesla long held the mantle of poster boy in the US 2020/21 tech rally, fanned my the biggest monetary expansion in history. Does its rally herald a comeback in tech, or is it one last dead cat bounce for the most over-hyped and over-priced stock in history?

To be fair to Tesla, there was some mis-reporting of Free Cash Flows being negative without its BitCoin sales. Not true (FCF = Operating Cash Flows - Cap-Ex), so the $621 million free cash flow was true, the BTC sale an investment cash flow. That said, the $0.8 billion reported net change in cash would have been negative without the BTC sale - which of course saw some loss of credibility to Musk given previous comments on the subject.

Perhaps a better understanding of the motivation for that decision on cash by its CEO and CFO can be helped by seeing the fall in free cash flows:

3Q21: $1,328M, 4Q21: $2,775M, 1Q22: $2,228, 2Q22: $621 

On a quarterly and trailing 12 month basis, Tesla announced:

**Revenues of $16.93 billion ($67.166 billion, 12 month ttv)**

**Net (GAAP) profits of $2.259 billion ($9.516 billion, 12 month ttv)**

**Free Cash Flow of $621 million ($6.952 billion, 12 month ttv)**

Tesla trades then at:

**13 x Price to sales;**

**89 x Price to earnings;**

**122 x Price to FCF**

Heady numbers, but Tesla is of course a growth stock and all about its future earnings potential in EV cars, semis, pick-ups, robo-taxis, business to business/customer tech sales, battery sales and artificial intelligence. Lets take a look at those areas vs its competitors...

China and Europe's large automobile markets (26 and 12 million sales in 2021) now have 1 in 5 cars sold as plug-ins (BEV/PHEV's) unlike the US mkt still showing only 1 in 20 EV sales from the 15 million vehicles sold in 2021. Tesla of course dominates US EV sales.

post,w6gig3,,"""79% of U.S. buyers would only buy a car if it supported CarPlay""","If this is true, then Apple is about to make a crap-ton of money. Some points from the [CNBC article](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/22/apple-carplay-could-be-a-trojan-horse-into-the-automotive-industry.html) where I found this stat:

* Apple engineering manager Emily Schubert said 98% of new cars in the U.S. come with CarPlay installed. She delivered a shocking stat: 79% of U.S. buyers would only buy a car if it supported CarPlay.

* The auto industry faces an unappealing choice: Offer CarPlay and give up potential revenue and the chance to ride a major industry shift, or spend heavily to develop their own infotainment software and cater to an potentially shrinking audience of car buyers who will purchase a new vehicle without CarPlay.

* GM, which wasn’t listed on Apple’s slide, already gets revenue of $2 billion per year from in-car subscriptions and expects it to grow to **$25 billion per year by 2030**. 

* Tesla, which doesn’t support CarPlay, recently shifted into selling its “FSD” driver-assistance features, including auto-parking and lane-keeping, as a subscription that costs as much $199 per month.

* The next generation of CarPlay will need significant buy-in from automakers to give Apple’s software access to core systems. Apple suggested it secured cooperation from several major carmakers.

* In June, Apple revealed that it has explored features that integrate commerce into the car’s cockpit. One new feature announced this summer would allow CarPlay users to navigate to a gas pump and pay for the fuel from the dashboard of the car, according to Reuters.

This sounds like an incredible source of revenue. Of course there will be a lot of push back from car manufacturers who obviously want to keep this revenue to themselves. But Apple has the advantage of offering with integrations such as:

* iPhone obviously.
* Watch, which I believe will be a lot more popular in the future as more advanced healthcare capabilities are added to it.

post,wayz3g,,The Fed vowed to crush inflation with higher rates. Then the stock market rallied. Here’s why. (It’s not good news)- Interesting read," The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by another 75 basis points despite acknowledging that economic growth is clearly slowing. The central bank, under Powell, reiterated that the path of least resistance is well-represented by the so-called dot plot: More hikes ahead — all the way to a fed funds rate of 3.75%!

And yet, the stock market has staged a humongous rally, led by the most valuation-sensitive and risk-sentiment-driven asset classes: Nasdaq stocks **COMP,** **+1.08%** and crypto.

**So … what the heck?!**

It all boils down to how one single sentence was able to affect the probability distributions that investors were projecting for different asset classes.  
Does it sound complicated? Bear with me: it’s not!

**Why did stocks rally?**

When the FOMC’s press release was published, it looked like business as usual: A well-telegraphed 75-bp hike with the only small surprise represented by an unanimous vote despite clear acknowledgment that economic growth is softening.

But not even 15 minutes into the press conference, the fireworks went off!  
In particular, when Powell said: ‘‘We are now at levels broadly in line with our estimates of neutral interest rates, and after front-loading our hiking cycle until now we will be much more data-dependent going forward.’’

 **This is very important for several reasons-**

The neutral rate is the prevailing rate at which the economy delivers its potential GDP growth rate — without overheating or excessively cooling down. With this 75-bp hike, Powell told us the Fed just reached its estimate of a neutral rate and, hence, from here they aren’t contributing to economic overheating anymore. But that also means any further increases are going to put the Fed in an actively restrictive territory. And the bond market knows that every time the Fed became restrictive in the past, they ended up breaking something.",4424,True,1659082069.0,2022-07-29 10:07:49,431,164,Johnblr,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/wayz3g/the_fed_vowed_to_crush_inflation_with_higher/,True,0.9,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,wfflk9,,Launch Control is still silly. I updated my sorted list of 5-60mph times to better reflect cars' real life acceleration performance.,"It's been more than a year since I did [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/i6qdmx/launch_control_is_silly_i_compiled_and_sorted_a/). Since then many new cars have come out and I thought it's appropriate for me to update the test a little.

For context, many popular magazines that do 0-60 tests on new vehicles measure them with the use of launch control. This mostly eliminates the effect of turbo lag, throttle delay and power delivery curve difference for many high performance cars that would all make significant differences in real life situations. Further more many American magazines subtract rollout time from their 0-60 result, which further downplays the difference in traction between different setups.

Which is why Car and Driver's 5-60 time is in my opinion the most accurate gauge of real life ""stomp-and-go"" acceleration scenario. So here is the updated list, with one additional column at the end (+x.xs) for some cars showing the discrepancy between the 0-60 and the 5-60 time. The larger this gap is the less representative is the car's 0-60 number of its real life capability. 

I've also removed cars from the previous list if there are newer models available.

Bolded entries are new ones added this time.

Summarized version; car auction purchase = apocalyptic disaster. 



Extended Version;

I like to frequent a semi-local (2 hour drive away) online auto auction house that specializes in selling bank/credit union repossessions. 

As you can imagine, most of these vehicles are a) American and b) not cared for. Chances are if someone financed a 2009 Chevy Equinox, the likelihood that they are well off financially is pretty low. Chevy Equinox indeed; most of the vehicles on here are undesirables. But every once in a while you come across a diamond in the rough, or so I thought would be... 

One Tuesday evening, I happened across one of my ""to own"" bucket list. You know, that list of cars you always wanted over the years but never found an opportunity to buy for cheap. Well, here I am; on that list is a 5 Cylinder powered Volkswagen Jetta, I had preferred a Sportwagen but realistically I had no need for one as I currently also own a Nissan Pathfinder, so I could get a sedan and give it daily driver status. 

The auction had a few hours left, and I pondered for about... 12 Seconds.

""$3000 is my Maximum Bid"" I said (to nobody but still out loud for reasons beyond comprehension), if it goes for more than that I won't increase. I place my bid and promptly... go do something else and completely forget that I even bid for a car that evening.

I wake up the next morning and start my routine, your typical dash for the coffee maker and creamer as the required morning pick me up. I sit at my kitchen cable, half eyed, staring at my phone screen, sifting through the junk mail and typical things I signed up for but didn’t actually sign up for.

“Congratulations! You’re the high bidder!”

post,wuwujv,,Chevy Bolt - Good Dealer Experince,"There are so many negative posts about dealers that I thought yoiu might enjoy hearing a good story. 

 I have a 2021 Tesla MY and my wife was driving a 2018 CR-V with 40,000 miles on it. We started wondering about the resale value and going all electric. On July 10, we checked the CR-V value at [webuyanycar.com](http://webuyanycar.com/) and seeing a $27,000 valuation (we paid $33,500 new), decided it was time. Given good press for the Bolt, the price reduction, and our need for a car for errands and short trips, we decided to start there. We do frequently road trip from Philadelphia to Daytona, but we always use the Tesla for that anyway (autopilot is a gamechanger on long trips). 

We visited Armen Chevrolet in Ardmore, PA, close to our house. They didn't have any Bolt's to test drive (we were not surprised) but they did have a 2022 at their service location and we were able to get in and play with the infotainment system. That car was awaiting the battery replacement so they would not let us go anywhere. The deal they offered was straight forward. Price is MRSP. Put down a $500 refundable deposit and he will call when they ""get an allocation.""  We spent just a few minutes on the configuration: Red, LT-2 adding adaptive cruise, L2 charger, and floor mats for a total of $30,885, including $995 destination charge. The salesperson was very nice, not at all ""salesy"", and he said we're looking at October/November. 

Later that day we went to Pizzaro Nissan nearby.  The Nissan dealer was playing games with the Leaf with a $12,000 non-optional ""value package."" They had no Leaf of any trim to even look at. He also did call back when I called with a question. 

We then went to CarMax and sold the CR-V (we don't need two cars for the next few months) for $28,000! Still makes us wonder what we're missing. 

On 7/18, we called Armen and gave him our credit card. We checked back on on 8/18 and the salesperson told us we're #3 and ""October-ish is still good.",2185,True,1661182610.0,2022-08-22 17:36:50,53,24,105BigDave,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/wuwujv/chevy_bolt_good_dealer_experince/,True,0.92,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,wx7vp2,,"Issues and service experience with Tesla M3 after 10,000 km"," 

1. The front suspension is as noisy on uneven roads as a car with over 100,000 km. Tesla service says that they've changed the necessary parts, but the sound is still there.
2. There was a rattling noise from both seatbelt adjustment knobs on the b-pillars. Again, parts are changed, but the issue is still there.
3. The seatbelt alarm goes off in the back seats, even with empty child seats. This is a recent issue; I didn't have a problem with the same seats initially. Tesla service said they had tested it and didn't see a problem. When I drove off from the service, I noticed that the seatbelt was buckled in by someone, so no wonder they didn't notice the problem.
4. If it's hot outside (above 30-35 deg. C), the memory function of the mirrors and car seats is entirely different from the saved settings and needs readjustment. The service couldn't test this as it's not as hot outside anymore.
5. I've lost the cellular reception entirely for a couple of hours a day (again, when it was hot outside). That's a real pain on a long road trip where you expect the route planner to find you the next supercharger. The service couldn't verify this.
6. Once during a supercharging session in the middle of nowhere, I went to the toilet, and when I returned, the phone key didn't work. Restarting the app didn't help. The only solution I found was the remote start from the app. Scary; don't forget your key cards.
7. There was an annoying rattling sound from the back seats as one of the covers was loose. The service guys fixed it, but now a new vibration appears whenever I accelerate.
8. The middle of the touchscreen makes a clicking noise if I touch it. It's a known issue; no fix is available yet.
9. When I used Autopilot, the car braked suddenly at least once every 100 km on a 2,800 km (only highway) road trip.

Mr. Zatko alleges that:

* Twitter is in material noncompliance with both its obligations under a 2011 FTC consent decree and its general obligations under data privacy, unfair trade practice, and consumer protection laws and regulations;
* Twitter is uniquely vulnerable to systemic disruption resulting from data center failures or malicious actors, a fact which Twitter leadership (including its CEO) have ignored and sought to obfuscate;
* Twitter’s platform is built in significant part on the misappropriation and infringement of third party intellectual property; and
* Twitter acquiesced to demands made by the Indian government that its agents be hired by Twitter and given access to Twitter user information.

Basically, Elon's lawyers are contending that even if the court rejects his prior termination this NEW termination provides more than enough reason to terminate:

post,x2vrgs,,Did Elon Hook up with T-Mobile Just So FSD 10.69 Will Continue to Work?," 

Without map data/connectivity, FSD does not seem to work so well.  (I had a compilation video link showing beta tester's experiences, but the post got taken down - see below.)  Anyway, FSD was not working nearly as well without connection as it does with.

From Tesla:

""Added a new “deep lane guidance” module to the Vector Lanes neural network which fuses features extracted from the video streams with coarse map data, i.e. lane counts and lane connectivities. This architecture achieves a 44% lower error rate on lane topology compared to the previous model, enabling smoother control before lanes and their connectivities becomes visually apparent. This provides a way to make every Autopilot drive as good as someone driving their own commute, yet in a sufficiently general way that adapts for road changes.""

I'm thinking Elon is creating this Starlink feature just to ensure that FSD continues to work well after 10.69.

Also, I posted a link to my YouTube video showing how much worse FSD 10.69 works without data connectivity, but it got taken down.

post,x4d1g4,,"Poor reliability isn't the only issue with EV fast-charging. Even when working as intended, the current design of EV fast-charging in the US is not fit for universal adoption (including Tesla...","TLDR: If EVs are truly going to fully replace gas cars then recharging an EV should be as convenient, consistent, and fast (within reason) as refilling a gas car. With the current EV fast charging design, that won't happen. So the charging sites that we're deploying today will eventually be outdated. We should start future-proofing today so that we spend the resources on something that will still be useful in 40 years.  

First things first, this a US-centric post about DC Ultra-Fast Charging. Some of it will apply to other countries, but not all. This is not referring to Level 2 or fast charging in areas where you’re meant to spend significant time like the movie theater or shopping mall. I also don’t care about any of the excuses for why it is this way. “It costs too much”, “Peak demand charges”, “The technology isn’t there yet”. None of that is my concern. The message has been sent that EVs are the future, so I am simply pointing out how the design of fast charging needs to improve in order for ICE to truly become obsolete. One of the first things that I was taught as an Electrical Engineer was to ensure that my designs were as future-proof as possible. Obviously, this is difficult to do with an emerging technology like DC Fast-Chargers (DCFC), but when billions of dollars are being poured into the transition to EVs, we should be making every effort to ensure that the money spent today isn’t wasted on something that will be obsolete in a decade or two. If the US is serious about transitioning from ICE vehicles to EVs, then we need to ensure that charging is as easy and convenient as filling up with gas. I also am not here to talk about things like reliability, number of charge sites, location of sites, etc. I am trying to focus on what’s wrong with the sites when they’re working exactly as they were designed to.

There is nothing more aggravating than having to change stalls just to get a charge, or to get a decent rate.  Find a stall, park, pull up the app, punch in the station/stall code, plug in while holding the top part of the CCS charger (communication part) tight against the car and hope that it initiates, wait to see if it starts and gives full power, rinse and fucking repeat if it doesn't.

post,x7de20,,Goldman Sachs Remains Bullish on Tesla After Meeting,"Electric vehicle maker, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is trading up in pre-market on Tuesday following a note by a Goldman Sachs analyst. The analyst reiterated a Buy rating and $333.33 price target on TSLA after meeting with the company’s VP of Investor Relations, Martin Viecha.

Tesla believes that consumers will increasingly move toward EVs, even as it is too soon to quantify the effects of the newly signed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The analyst believes that consumers will be attracted to electric vehicles in the same way they were attracted towards other technology inflections (e.g. CRT to LCD TVs, and feature phones to smartphones). However, the EV industry could be supply-constrained over the intermediate term as new battery/component supply and assembly take time to ramp up.

Software and services, especially FSD, remain a key focus for the company as they continue to develop software and services to monetize the growing installed base of connected vehicles. Tesla believes FSD is one of the most important efforts in this category, and the company is targeting a wide release of its beta software in North America this year.

The analyst wrote in his note that he believes that ""Tesla, given its leadership position in EVs (including its vertical integration and tight coupling of hardware and software, as well as its ecosystem of charging stations and brand), and its focus on clean transportation more broadly (given its solar and storage businesses) is well positioned to capitalize on the long-term shift to EVs. We expect Tesla to expand margins in the intermediate term as it ramps the important Model Y product as well as new factories in Berlin, Germany and Austin, Texas, and in the long-term as it increases its mix of software revenue.""

post,x8gkxr,,Retail concompetitive T-Bill auctions vs SGOV etf,"In the recent past, T-bills seemed pretty useless because they paid zero interest. Now they seem to be far better than savings accounts and money market accounts, and possibly outperforming bank CD's.

I'm going to ignore ""treasury direct"" so please consider it off topic.

There seem to be two remaining popular ways to get t-bill interest rate:

1. Buy T-Bills via a retail brokerage; seems like you have to use a ""non-competitive"" bid, which is basically a blind bid with a surprise interest rate ""discount"". 
2. Buy a t-bill ETF such as SGOV

What are the upsides for parking fiat between those two methods ?

My guess is the advantages are

T-bills:

* State Tax advantages for directly owning t-bills vs getting dividends via an ETF
* No expense ratio, so you get those last few basis points
* No risk of the price dropping like mad

ETF:

* works like autopilot so you dont have to manage it
* Not having aas much downtime for your fiat pile between t-bills when they expire till the next auction
* Can sell anytime with less overhead

I think this quote says it all.  Tesla claimed that their self driving tech was so close to release that the only obstacle was regulatory approval.  This was absolutely 100% a lie at the time it was claimed.  And that claim sold not just Autopilot but a lot of Tesla cars.  ""It's an Appreciating Asset because it has the hardware to be a robotaxi!"" That's a claim that Elon has made numerous times.

Elon has also said that 'there was no question, guaranteed, based on the data he's seeing internally that FSD would be as safe or safer than a person by the end of the year without any supervision.'

This is also 100% a lie.  If we look at the public FSD Beta Tracker data, FSD Beta is **today** many orders of magnitude away from human safety (unsupervised) and the trend lines **today** are definitely *not* trending toward human safety within the next 2+ years.

There's being overly optimistic and there's a lie that's counter to all of the data.    If I say ""Based on my current speed I'll be in the office in 30 minutes."" but you're in New York City and the office is in LA, it's not being ""overly optimistic"" that you'll maybe get abducted by aliens and carried by a UFO at hypersonic speeds and then dropped off in the parking lot... you're lying.

FSD and how it they're saying 160,000 customers are testing the beta, when they only had 2000 last year with a ton of pull request from the fleet of cars.

post,xvg2gw,,Battery drain in Tesla vs Etron - any tips?,"So my 2022 Etron is currently in the shop and I’ve been using a rental 2022 Model Y LR for the past few weeks (which was the car I’d been considering instead, so it’s been fun to do a side by side comparison).

The Model Y has a bunch of fun tech (sentry mode, voice control, it’s super quick, etc) - but I’ve noticed a couple of things that were surprising:

1. Autopilot isn’t any better than lane keeping assist in my Etron.  (The car technically has FSD, but that doesn’t seem to be active - presume Hertz isn’t in the beta?).  The rental Kia’s I’ve had on vacation are better - so I’m curious where the Tesla hype is coming from (perhaps this car has cameras not radar)

2. Vampire drain in the Tesla is real and bad.  I can leave my Etron parked for ~weeks, and I won’t lose a single mile of range (which is good, because the range is admittedly pretty bad vs the Y).  The Tesla, on the other hand, dumps range while sitting in my driveway.

I *think* this is due to sentry mode - does anyone else experience this?

I ran a test on the Tesla and the sentry mode drain.
Last Thursday I charged it up to 90%.  Unplugged, drove it to the covered airport parking lot at SJC, and had ~85% battery remaining.  Turned off climate control, turned off cabin temperature protection but left on sentry mode.
Flew out for a few days, came back yesterday.  
Sentry mode picked up 3 things.
Battery had dropped to 56%.
So 29% drop in 4 days while stationary and “off” with sentry enabled.

Is this common, or is there something wrong with this one?",1540,False,1664892484.0,2022-10-04 16:08:04,21,74,Jmbh1983,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/xvg2gw/battery_drain_in_tesla_vs_etron_any_tips/,True,0.77,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

comment,xvg2gw,xvg2gw,,"A Tesla loses about 2 miles of range per WEEK from phantom drain. If you have sentry mode on, the car not only doesn't shut off, but it is running all the cameras and GPU in the computer constantly; it uses about 2 miles range per HOUR. The other thing that can use power is if you have cabin overheat protection enabled; this feature will turn on the AC if the cabin temperature gets above 40C / 105F (which can happen on a bright day, even if it's not very warm out). As you can imagine, running the AC uses energy too. Don't use sentry mode at home, and don't use cabin overheat protection unless you mean to.

With regards to Autopilot (not FSD), it's simple traffic-aware cruise control with a little integration with speed limits (which you can configure). My experience is that it has been pretty much on par with other Adaptive Cruise Control systems from other brands (Skoda, Kia, and GM). The thing that throws most people off is that if you set it up to pay attention to the speed limit, it can get the speed limits of ramps sometimes if you are too far to the right and the sign to close to the highway; that's annoying because the car will slow.",1158,False,1664898143.0,2022-10-04 17:42:23,36,0,[deleted],electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/xvg2gw/battery_drain_in_tesla_vs_etron_any_tips/ir11fzf/,True,,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,ir11fzf

post,y2bwo8,,Things I wish my Model 3 had,"I have a 2020 M3P with over 50K miles on it and have driving across the USA several times and here is what I'd like to see in no specific order or priority:

\- Bring back radar, Vision SUCKS. Way more phantom braking events, and autopilot slows down in foggy conditions when with radar it did not. Also, radar would show cars in front of me 2 or 3 deep, now with vision, all I see is the one in front on my visualization screen. Although, vision seems to do a better job at lane-keeping. So, a hybrid radar/vision might be best. It’s so bad that I rarely use autopilot anymore because when I do, I’m always on edge, ready to unintentionally brake check someone at a moment’s notice. You know a function is badly designed when the user is incentivized to NOT use that function. One of the biggest reasons I and probably most people bought Tesla was because of autopilot, and now it’s degraded to the point of not using it. 

\- Implement a dumb cruise control that only keeps the speed constant like every other car. I don't want phantom braking and making people angry behind me who think I brake checked them, I don't want to slow down in foggy conditions or around curves, I don't want lane keeping, I don't want distance keeping, I don't want 85 MPH to be my top limit. I just want the speed kept constant as if I had my foot on the accelerator and nothing else. 

\- Allow switching of accelerations speeds by tapping the ""chill"" word, just like tapping the battery changes it from % to miles. Or have different driving profiles available at the tap of a button, like the M buttons on BMW M cars. I don’t want to change my entire Driver profile to do this. 

\- Fix the music UI where half the song's name and band can't be seen even though there is plenty of real estate in the music bar. Show the time/time remaining in the song instead of just having the status bar at the bottom.

The big things are, we need the Blindspot light on the side of your mirrors, it’s way more accurate and way more dependable, but most importantly, it’s faster to use that than to look at the screen look at the mirror look out the window look at the screen, etc. before changing lanes, and the Blindspot camera isn’t even that great. Mine are washed out at night so it’s basically unusable if it’s not daytime, The blind spot light is so easy I just don’t get why it’s not there.

My Ford Edge would beep and let me know if there was a car coming behind me when I was backing up, the blind spot light on the mirror would also turn on from whatever direction the car behind me is coming from.

post,y2h9ij,,Tesla Vision is a major regression on Model Y,"I realize this has been talked about a bit, but just wanted to share my experiences. I have an early 2020 Model Y with enhanced autopilot. I drive quite a bit for work and have put over 72k miles on my Model Y. I have autopilot engaged probably over 90% of the time because most of my driving is on the interstate. A few weeks ago I got the Tesla Vision update. Tesla Vision has provided no discernible advantage and has a lot of issues compared to the radar based system:

* Further follow distance. I am not sure why they haven't just renamed 2 to 1. It seems weird that it's not possible to set the follow distance to 1 under any conditions. 
* Speed limited to 85 mph. This is the one thing that doesn't really affect me as over 85 mph is considered reckless driving in my state.
* Automatic wipers required. My windshield was a bit dirty on the hour long drive home on a clear day yesterday, and the wipers refused to turn off. Tried cleaning with the washer fluid without success.
* Automatic high beams required. The automatic high beams work horribly while driving on the interstate. They are tripped up by the simplest things like highway signs. I am basically constantly flashing my high beams unless I am in heavy traffic (in which case they stay off). I am legitimately concerned the police are going to pull me over for this.
* Autopilot can no longer reliably see two cars ahead. This was actually a fairly useful feature. For instance, if there was a large car in front of me driving slow in the left lane, it would help me determine whether it was just that one car (so I could easily undertake) or multiple cars.
* Autopilot and cruise control can no longer be used in fog. This is the most egregious limitation. My commute to work is through the Blue Ridge mountains. Fog is frequent. There was one week where I didn't make it to work a single day without autopilot disengaging due to fog.

post,y407rm,,"Disappointed in the EV marketplace and that Tesla still has the best overall product, particularly in 5 key areas.","I’ve owned two full BEV EVs and currently own a plug-in hybrid. I always knew I’d eventually get back to driving a long range BEV EV sometime soon after parting ways with my Tesla Model S 75D about 3 years ago. I’ve been following the EV market ever since and when I knew the time had come to go back to a long range EV, I was *tremendously* excited. A lot has changed in the six years since I was in the market for an EV. At that time the Model 3 wasn’t even out yet and an inventory Model S 75D was the best option for me.

I’ve seen so many great looking EVs in my price range come to market since then and I was excited to dive into learning about all of them and going on lots of test drives. This time I was certainly looking for something cheaper than Model S. So that limits things down to a half-dozen great cars to look into:

* Tesla Model Y/3
* Hyundai Ioniq 5
* Kia EV6
* Mustang Mach E
* Volkswagen ID4
* Polestar 2

&#x200B;

After reading people's comparisons of Teslas to everything else, I realize they’re still the leader in 5 key areas. Not paying super close attention to the market and the community for a number of years, I’ve come to learn that *some of these 5 areas are just not at all important to a lot folks*, which is shocking to me.

They are:

* Vehicle Fast-Charging Capability and Long Distance Infrastructure
* Driving Assist (autopilot)
* Infotainment (hardware, but especially software)
* Smartphone App and Connectivity Integration
* Buying Experience

**Vehicle Fast-Charging Capability and Long Distance Infrastructure**

3. Ease of installation of home charger for first-time buyers, such as including it with the purchase of the car.

post,y4agt8,,Auto high beams make Autopilot unusable at night,"The recent mandatory high beams with autopilot is basically the biggest step backward I’ve seen in my 6 years of owning teslas. The biggest issue is implementation and complete lack of predictability. 

It’s not possible to know at night if engaging Autopilot will cause the high beams to activate. Just last night I tried to activate Autopilot and the high beams came on making the car 3 lengths ahead of me think I was telling them to speed up so they brake checked me. 

Here are the issues. 

1. High beams turn on with every activation of autopilot.
2. There is no delay to give you the chance to turn them off. If the car thinks they should be on, the millisecond AP engages they come on.
3. The algorithm for the auto high beams is pathetically poor. They come on with cars in front of you, they come on with traffic coming the other way, they come on while traveling on well lit urban streets. 

All of this combines to make it so much of a hassle and annoyance to use Autopilot at night that it’s essentially not useable anymore. 

I get Tesla is covering their ass while they struggle to get the vision only AP system working but this is absolutely not the way to go about it. 

I would like to see at least one of the following. 

1. A timer that gives you 3 seconds to turn the high beams off after engaging AP

2. If the high beams have been disabled once during the drive they won’t turn back on till the car has done a Park Drive cycle

3. A complete opt out with a warning that AP function will be degraded.",1523,False,1665795627.0,2022-10-15 03:00:27,294,144,BombFish,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/y4agt8/auto_high_beams_make_autopilot_unusable_at_night/,True,0.88,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,y4mawl,,Watch me struggle to turn the headlights back on on a pitch black road. Headlights need physical controls!,"A slightly frightening experience that I have dash cam footage of illustrates why these controls need to be close, immediately available, and physical.

Here’s the video: https://imgur.com/a/BiIy93H

Here are the facts: 
* I engage autopilot on a dark road. I don’t want the brights on and see an ephemeral menu with headlight options at a glance, so I hit “off,” assuming that these are controls for auto brights. It’s now pitch black and I can’t see where I’m going. This is my mistake, but drivers make mistakes and car interfaces should be forgiving.
* The intuitive action in this scenario is for me to reverse the physical action that I’ve taken and turn them back on the menu is gone now, and I’m in a scenario where I’m driving blind and trying to open a menu, scan the busy screen, and get the lights back on.
* I’m essentially forced to pull over and figure it out.
* You have a hint for what I fall back on and what requires the least thinking because I initially turn my blinker on, then the hazard lights, for some amount of light to see where I’m going. Both of these are physical controls.

Apologists will come up with 10,000 ways to blame me or say that “you should have/could have just done x,” but the point is that scenarios like this are unexpected and it should be intuitive to reverse them. I’m also not certain why the car allows headlights to be turned off at night, in drive, and at speed.

I’m a professional UX Designer and will clearly say that how Tesla has headlight control implemented has severe usability issues. I can get along with things like climate being behind menus, but not something as safety-critical as headlights.

They obviously can’t go around adding physical controls, but a band-aid could be something like only allowing headlight changes in park, or requiring confirmation of turning off the lights when it’s dark outside.

post,y67b12,,Inflation will remain elevated for a few more years,"**TLDR**: Companies will keep investing in redundant, diversified supply chains. Countries will force more localization due to national security risks. Energy prices will remain high. China will stick to its zero-covid policy. Rising rates will reduce demand and make credit more expensive. Reduced demand will hurt the economies of scale. Expensive credit will make ongoing investments more expensive to complete. Prices will keep going up for a few years, until these factors are mitigated. The market bottom will be when the companies cancel stock buybacks and start printing shares.

# Long read

The prevailing narrative today is that central banks will keep raising interest rates and sucking money out of the economy by other means, which will tame inflation sometime soon in 2023 due to reduced demand and economic slowdown. This is what the financial markets are pricing in, judging by bets on rates and bonds.

However, the global inflation we are experiencing today is not driven purely by monetary policies. That’s why inflation is global, spanning the whole world, even though different countries have vastly different monetary policies.

There are pockets of inflation, which are global, and were caused by relentless money printers, like real estate, travel, luxury goods, crypto, and various other assets. This is where the largest price reductions will continue. If you have any type of asset, it’s safe to say it will depreciate even more. Declines in housing and rent will drive down inflation metrics across the world, helping the central banks get closer to their inflation targets.

But the central banks cannot meet their 2% goals, because they cannot mitigate other factors causing global inflation. These are supply chain issues, caused first by COVID-19, then strict China zero-covid policies, then Russian invasion of Ukraine. We have an energy and food crises on top of that, also caused by the war in Ukraine.",13239,True,1666002005.0,2022-10-17 12:20:05,717,188,tebedam,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/y67b12/inflation_will_remain_elevated_for_a_few_more/,True,0.78,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,y78460,,Basic Autopilot problems getting worse and worse by the update. Stop-and-go traffic basically unusable.,"I’ve had my ’22 M3 RWD coming up on a year. It of course was always fully Vision Only with no radar. Over the past year, I had to wait for updates to get up to similar specs as the radar enabled cars: following distance, finally 85MPH, etc. Overall in the beginning, I didn’t have too many complaints with Autopilot. I didn’t have the phantom braking that many did. The only complaint I had early on was Autopilot drove too aggressively in stop-and-go traffic. Mainly it would fully accelerate up if the car in front just barely moved. It was so embarrassing I would never use it with guests in the car. I was able to work around that for the most part by lowering autopilot speed and changing to chill mode in those moments. Not ideal but it somewhat worked. I would do every software update in hopes it would fix it, like a lot of do. Fast forward to today. I down right refuse to use Autopilot in traffic because of how dangerous it is. It drives like a teenager learning to drive. It still does that full acceleration thing but now it slams on the brakes as soon as a car in front stops in stop-and-go traffic. And when I say the car in front stops, I don’t mean they slammed on their brakes, they were driving like a normal good driver would. I’ve had two different times where the brake check my cars does causes the person behind me to almost hit me. Needing to swerve off to the side. I’m too fearful to use it for the day when a driver behind me is just a tad distracted and bam, accident.  My old tricks of speed, following distance, chill mode, don’t seem to matter as much. 

Is anyone else dealing with this shit? I keep hearing they are gonna combine the FSD stack and life will be bliss but I’m not holding my breath.

post,y7zjpn,,MS Cleaning inside glass in front of front facing camera,"
Recent posts about stop and go traffic and autopilot deterioration led to a few posts about hazing in front of the front cameras. In no way am I suggesting that cleaning the glass fixes stop-and-go issues, but if you have hazing (like I did), cleaning is moderately easy but does require patience and an awareness of when not to force a screw. I’ve linked a video below that describes this for a Model 3. It’s almost all the same for Model S (can’t speak to new MS, mine is 16/17) except the screws.  See the picture - 6 torx screws hold on the metal camera chassis. Crucial you don’t mess these up. (Edit: I’m second guessing which pair of screws in the top of the image to remove, but it’s obvious when you get in there).  Remove bottom 2 first. 

Instructions: There is a cover over the base of the rear view that comes off by hand. A pry tool is needed to get the next larger plastic housing off but be aware that there are (at least on a 16/17 MS) four small metal clips that are prone to coming loose. Be certain to watch for them, and if they come off just slide them back on. There is also a sort of lip that covers the mirror base to be careful of. With that removed the mirror can come down. The mirror is secured via a triangular sort of cam. Grab the mirror post firmly and twist from the base (no wrench needed as in video). It takes some effort but once it’s off you can remove the last plastic cover and metal chassis that holds the cameras. 6 T10 torx screws hold them on (pictured, double check the last pair). Do NOT force these to the point of rounding out the drive. Do NOT use too small a torx bit either. That’s a quick way to round them out as well. This metal chassis has to be firmly secured to the car or else the cameras will move around and render them mostly useless (I assume).  Carefully remove the 6 screws and the camera chassis will come loose (in the linked video for the M3 there appear to be only 2).

post,y8sdc4,,On Tesla's valuation (Part Trois),"Six and twelve months ago I made posts breaking down Tesla's hotly debated valuation ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8ka1h/on_teslas_valuation_part_deux/)) to determine whether it's really as expensive as people say, or as cheap as Tesla bulls claim.

After yesterday's earnings report, my analyses continue to seem fairly accurate, and I thought it would be worth updating the numbers to see if anything's changed.

For those who don't like reading, you can skip straight to ""The Numbers"". For everyone else, I will first explain again how I got to my numbers.

------------------------------

**The method**

While trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth into the future to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap might change slightly today, let's use their pre-earnings market cap of roughly $700B to determine if Tesla really is over- or undervalued.

For this post, I have also added the PEG rating, as this can give us a bit more insight into the valuation of a growth stock like Tesla.

**The trends**

In terms of revenue (TTM), Tesla had grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021 in my first analysis. After Q3 2022, that has grown to $74,863, with Q3 2022 being a 55% YoY increase.

In terms of operating margin, Tesla had grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021. After Q3 2022, that has grown to 17.2%.

In terms of GAAP net income (TTM), Tesla had grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,499M after Q3 2021. After Q3 2022, this has grown to $11,190M, with Q3 2022 being a 103% YoY increased.",9642,True,1666254030.0,2022-10-20 10:20:30,163,183,Ehralur,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y8sdc4/on_teslas_valuation_part_trois/,True,0.84,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,y95b0b,,"Test Drive Shootout: Rivian RS1, Tesla Y and 3, Ford MachE, Kia EV6, Audi Q4 E-tron"," 

I am a Tesla 2021 Dual Motor (with Accel Boost) LR Model Y, and Model 3 RWD SR owner. I also have a Tesla Roof and Powerwall on order.  I am also on the waitlist for a Rivian RS1, and was invited to a Rivian RS1 “First Mile” test drive. The next day, I drove a 2021 Mustang Mach E Premium and 2022 EV6 GT-Line AWD, both lightly used at a local Ford dealer. My buddy Rob, this same week, drove the Mustang Mach E, and Audi q4 E-Tron. Here is our summary:

TL;DR: All have very different personalities, and present credible alternatives to Tesla. The Tesla Supercharging Network and OTA Firmware and Software updates still present differentiating (and disappearing ) advantages that continue to position Tesla as a leader. However, the EV alternatives each have distinguishing characteristics that are done better than Tesla. My next purchases will likely be an RS1 for me, and the Kia EV6 for my wife. Rob has chosen the Audi E-Tron.

**EV6 Summary:**

Those in the know understand the killer product line coming out of Kia. With JD Power quality ratings just behind Lexus and Porsche and a design team built around ex BMW engineers, the Kia offering exudes, quality, composure and character that makes KIA the preferred choice of the Hyundai Group (Hyundai , Kia, Genesis) stable of EV offerings. Heads up display and 800V fast DC charging add to the most composed ride of the test group.

Pros:

800 V DC Fast Charging

Composed and comfortable cabin, chassis, ride; 

Hushed cabin with no road noise

Great front seats

CarPlay and Android Auto Integration

5 YR/50,000 Basic Warranty; 10 YR/100,000 Powertrain and Battery Warranty

Excellent fit and finish

Cons:

Limited rear hatch space; No Front Truck space

post,y9f39l,,Forced FSD disengagement for wearing sunglasses?,"This has happened twice to me so far, technically just while using auto pilot on the freeway. I'm paying attention to the road, and do not even have the chance to respond to the warning on screen and there are no blue flashes before the disengagement happens. It just happens suddenly.

At this point, I really do not use FSD at all, so I've turned it off as I do not want to lose future access to the technology for a silly issue with me wearing sunglasses for whatever reason.

I've never had a problem with forced autopilot disengagements (prior to FSD enabled) even while wearing sunglasses, but in the event that this does happen (with FSD now turned OFF) will that somehow still count as a strike against the use of FSD in the future?

FSD lane preference is horrid, so many times it won’t change to the best lane for the upcoming turn until the last minute even though it’s had plenty of time to do so. 
Or I’ll be in the best lane for the upcoming turn < 1 mile away and it decides to get out of the lane when it should be staying in the lane since the turn is coming up.

It also seems like Tesla is pretty worried about getting stuck at a 'local maximum' and is taking lots of measures to avoid relying on almost anything except vision for critical decisions. Or at least to have the option to change around their priorities and architecture to get out of a local maximum if they find themselves stuck there.

post,ybsa9b,,Why didn't it stop!? :( I caused an accident.,"To start off, I take full responsibility for this. I'm not blaming Tesla or anyone for my driving. It was my mistake and I accept my flaws 😅 and still love my Tesla !!!!

Now to explain the situation.

I was getting on a highway from a on-ramp that had a yelid sign. There was a truck in front of me also waiting for a chance to murge onto the highway.

The truck started to proceed forward onto the highway and so I turned around to look if it was clear for me, it was... So I hit the accelerator and drove right into the truck ( that for some reason stopped ).

My question is why wasn't this prevented by my model 3. Autopilot or FSD was not on at the time, but there was no intervention or even a warning about a collision.

I'm a bit torned about this because I feel like the safety features that I always brag about to people let me down and I was wondering if this was just just an inconsistency with the safety features or am I missing something?

# Introduction

## Background

Intel used to be a giant in the microchip and semiconductor sector, but recently it found itself eclipsed by its competitor in matters of quality, strategic development and public perception. Those changes are due to its recent management team, which stagnated the company and slowed it with bad management decisions. With the new CEO Pat Gelsinger and his expertise, direct experience and know-how in the sector, the company is moving out from its slowdown and trying to catch up with its main rivals.

## Purpose

The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the development of Intel Corporation (INTC) during the past four years, from 2018 to 2021 and forecast its activity for the next five years. Not only are the financial statements taken into consideration but also macroeconomics factors and its main competitor Advanced Micro Device (AMD).

All is made to answer the following questions:

* What is its position compared to competitors?",23359,True,1666652778.0,2022-10-25 01:06:18,121,61,YungChaky,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ycpfr9/intel_analysis_serious_dd/,True,0.83,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,yflxve,,"The weekly ""Car Spotlight... Weekly"" Week 2: 1927-1931 Chevy AA/AB/etc.","u/Artien_Braum

Welcome back to the weekly “Car Spotlight… Weekly” thread!

A quick word before we get started on week 2 (ish). Because of the healthy engagement and the fact that we didn’t receive much feedback for the first article, I’m just going to make an (ass out of myself) assumption that everyone liked the format. So, we went ahead and just repeated what we did last time because I’m lazy AF (but really because I have a full time job and also consult for 3 other companies on the side and also am learning Spanish and HTML/CSS, but I digress). Anyway… shall we?

Rules (they haven’t changed):

1. This is a community driven thread. We will do our best to kick off the discussion, but need your help to fill it with juicy content.

2. Please, cite your references and give credit where it's due.

3. These are your fellow car enthusiasts. Even if you don't agree with their opinions, remember to always have their back and be respectful.

4. Be honest. We want to learn about the pros and the cons; the successes and the failures; the awesome and the infuriating. 

5. Enjoy the entertainment and learn something new.

Housekeeping (because my mom said I have to):

1. Please submit all requests for changes / improvements to the following [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/y3k3d4/the_weekly_car_spotlight_weekly_suggestions/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). This will help me stay organized. We also want to keep this weekly thread on-topic and not fill it with posts unrelated to the spotlit car.

2. Inflammable is STILL an annoying word. It has been 2 weeks and no one has done anything about it…

3. Be sure to read all the way to the end. I’ll have more information about the next spotlight down there.

post,yfou82,,Full self driving opt out,"Does anyone know if there is a way to remove full self driving beta?

It was fun for about a week, but there are some issues that make non-beta full self driving much more preferable.

Automatic windshield wipers forced on (this is really quite terrible as it functions quite poorly)
Automatic high beams (I really hate how it turns on every single time, within city limits and I’m worried about getting a ticket)
Automatic speed adjusting (this functions quite poorly now, barely slowing down as the speed changes, so I do it manually to avoid a ticket. Autopilot was a much more acceptable slow down)

And the most annoying thing, I’ve literally screamed at my car a few times now and quickly disabled anything FSD and switched to autopilot…

“Moving to fast lane” over and over again… you’re not supposed to be in the “fast lane” in Canada when there’s absolutely no traffic in front of you. The speed based lane changes happen even though it’s disabled. No way to stop it, it just keeps going into the wrong lane any chance it gets. I’ve looked up videos, read the manual, changed every setting and these problems persist. It completely bricks FSD beta for me.
And no, I didn’t pay for this. The company I work for gets us teslas as a benefit, I would never spend money on FSD, it absolutely not worth it.

The things I do like..
Stopping at red lights (same as FSD)
It accelerates quickly at green lights compared to regular FSD.
It doesn’t stop at every single flashing or green light like FSD does.

If anyone knows how to disable those functions, let me know. At this point it’s over engineered in a few areas which are actually things that Tesla can fix now.",1667,False,1666965310.0,2022-10-28 15:55:10,0,33,ColbysToyHairbrush,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/yfou82/full_self_driving_opt_out/,True,0.46,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,yjhuve,,Dodge Shows Crate Hurricanes and Hellephants at SEMA,"[Dodge](https://www.autoweek.com/dodge) is unleashing a fleet of Hellephant crate engines at this year’s SEMA show. The Hellephant debuted at [SEMA](https://www.autoweek.com/sema-show/) in 2018 as a stand-alone, 426-CID crate engine that boasted 1000 hp. Now Dodge and Direct Connection will sell you a whole array of Hellephant models that range in power and displacement. Dodge is also peeling the curtain back on its Hurricane inline-six-cylinder engine platform, and its plans for next-generation crate engines.

Kicking off the Hellephant line of engines is the entry-level 376-CID, iron-block Hellephant C30, which advertises a cool 900 hp. Cranking it up a notch, Dodge will push that same 376-CID Hellephant to over 1000 hp with the Hellephant C170. The different names represent the percent of ethanol in the fuel (like proof you’d find on a bottle of liquor). If you want even *more* power, Dodge still offers 426 CID Hellephants under the A30 and A170 banners, with 1000 hp and 1100 hp advertised respectfully. All of these V8 mills sport a 3.0-liter supercharger on top and have upgraded internal parts compared to the production Hemi engine.

If that’s not good enough, Dodge and Direct Connection will also offer race-ready Hemi mills. Direct Connection will feature two race-ready Hemi engines in its catalog: the Drag Pak Hemi that makes an NHRA-certified 630 hp from 354 CID, and 1500 hp from the 426 CID Hemi. Though if you’re going to want to snag one of these, you’ll need a deep bank account. The Drag Pak Hemi will set you back $56,995 and $59,995, respectively. 

Dodge isn’t only flexing its Hemi might at this year’s SEMA show. The team at Dodge and Direct Connection are also making the [I6 Hurricane engine available as a crate package](https://www.autoweek.com/news/a39525460/stellantis-hurricane-engine-details/).

post,ylcm2k,,One Year & 17k Miles Later with Model 3 LR,"I'm just about to hit a year with my Model 3 LR and just wanted to write a quick review for anyone considering purchasing one. 

I'm going to briefly touch on the most common questions I've heard and the experience I had with it. I'll keep it brief. 

First of all, I absolutely love the car, it's easily the most fun car I've ever owned, hands down. I constantly hear, ""It's built like a $20k car!"". Absolute non-sense! Have you driven a $20k car in 2022? I may be lucky but I've had zero issues with the car, other than a camera change, which was free and done at my home, while I was on vacation. Zero complaints!

Having everything on the center screen is great, I know many people complain about no buttons but there is a reason they aren't on our phones any more. Takes a bit to get use to, and by a bit I mean about 30min of driving. My brother drove it when he picked me up from the airport and said ""Very confusing, until you actually drive it, also how do you turn it off!"" Poor soul spent 30min googling trying to figure it out before he called me. 

Autopilot is great but I wouldn't spend a penny on FSD. I like to drive (zoom zoom) so I don't use it often but on long trips, what a god send. I remember a 4hr ride home, very hung over and thanking GOD for AP. It really does a great job staying in the lane and being comfortable. I've had maybe a few phantom breaks but almost all were when I first got it a year ago, total of maybe five light breaks for no reason but it's been nonexistant for a long time. 

Range is great, I absolutely needed the LR Model when I got the car but with a job change I no longer drive as much. I do feel like the range is a bit exaggerated, but not as much as people like to talk about. Currently I have about 97.5% battery capacity, so my max range is about 344 miles, which is still above the S+ and many other cars 100% range.",3642,True,1667504650.0,2022-11-03 20:44:10,224,122,MagnanimousCannabis,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ylcm2k/one_year_17k_miles_later_with_model_3_lr/,True,0.89,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,yoho5r,,"PSA: If your Tesla refuses to activate Autopilot with a ""Cruise Control Unavailable"" error, a door might be ""ajar"".","I just had to suffer through a few days of AP being broken in my 2018 LR RWD Model 3, before I finally decided it wouldn't fix itself and put in a service request. What was happening was that as soon as I tried to enable even just TACC, my car would throw up an error message saying ""Cruise Control Unavailable"" with a link to ""Read more"". The small steering wheel icon that indicates ""Autosteer is available"" would also never come up.

That link in the error message led into the car's built-in Owner's Manual (a pretty nice feature!), which is what gave me the obscure hint I needed to figure out the problem and cancel my service request.

The manual mentions that TACC may refuse to activate for various reasons, including if one of your doors is open. Of course, all of my doors were closed, and nothing was seemingly amiss, as every other system in my car worked fine, and I wasn't getting any other kind of warning about open doors. But on this hunch, I tried opening and closing all four doors and the trunk, and as soon as I got back onto the road, AP was finally available.

So I think what may have happened was that AP got into a state where *it* thought a door was open, but the rest of the car didn't. Probably some sort of minor bug in the AP stack (I don't have FSD beta). So I thought I'd let he folks here know, in case something like this ever happens to them.",1379,False,1667812983.0,2022-11-07 10:23:03,58,34,coredumperror,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/yoho5r/psa_if_your_tesla_refuses_to_activate_autopilot/,True,0.83,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,yrzodf,,Elon Musk tells Twitter staff he sold Tesla stock to save the social network," 

Twitter's new owner Elon Musk, who is also CEO of electric vehicle maker [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) and U.S. defense contractor SpaceX, told employees of the social media business on Thursday that he recently sold shares of Tesla to ""save Twitter.""

He made the remarks during an all-hands meeting that he hosted in part to motivate Twitter employees who remain after sweeping layoffs to work hard. Musk let go of about half of Twitter employees following his acquisition of the company for $44 billion, or $54.20 per share.

[As CNBC previously reported,](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/) to finance his portion of that take-private deal, last week Musk sold at least another $3.95 billion worth of [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) stock. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission published Tuesday, the batch of shares he just sold amounted to 19.5 million more shares of Tesla.

Earlier this year, he also sold over $8 billion worth of Tesla stock in April and roughly $7 billion worth in August.

Musk has [brought in employees from Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html), including dozens of Autopilot engineers, to help with code review and other work at Twitter along with friends, financial backers and deputies from other companies that he has co-founded.

 

Among other things, [Musk wants Twitter to generate half of its revenue from Twitter Blue subscribers](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/read-elon-musks-first-email-to-all-twitter-employees.html), and to become less reliant on advertising revenue.

Musk’s Twitter distraction has shaken some of Tesla’s most stalwart bulls. For example, [CNBC Pro reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/wedbush-removes-tesla-from-its-top-stocks-list-says-twitter-deal-an-albatross.html), Wedbush Securities has removed Tesla from its top stock list.",2109,True,1668136285.0,2022-11-11 04:11:25,3040,622,tang4685,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yrzodf/elon_musk_tells_twitter_staff_he_sold_tesla_stock/,True,0.95,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

post,yuln4j,,I want peoples opinions on $TSLA,"*Short term noise*

$TSLA has fallen ~50% from ath mostly due to raising rates and all that shit but more recently the blue bird and Elon selling shares to feed the bird. 

The twitter purchase is annoying to me for 3 reasons. It takes away Elons time, its already cost a lot of $TSLA stock and he might end up selling more, and it’s causing uproar and extra downward pressure on the stock. But at the end of the day, it’s short term noise. Elon could sell all 420 million shares or whatever he owns and nothing would happen to Tesla the company longterm. 

Elon has been more erratic than usual lately, maybe it’s stress maybe he’s actually losing it. Maybe the power is going to his head, or it might just all be an act. Some of those are more likely than other of course, I’ll leave that there. Worst case Elon sells all his shares, tanking the stock and probably getting booted from the CEO spot. Idk if that’s actually how that works but regardless, Tesla would still be okay longterm. In my personal opinion, I think Elon is important to the company. I understand why some disagree, but that’s not what I’m debating here. 

*”DD”*

Tesla recently hit a PE of 56 with a forward PE of 35. Their last 3 quarters of earnings were $8.87b total, with a below average Q2 due to covid shutdowns in China. Q2 was only $2.26b in earnings, so if we assume tesla earns at least that (meaning negative growth Q/Q) 2022 will have earnings of $11.13b. 2021 and 2020 earnings were $5.52b and $721m. That will be another year of 100%+ earnings growth Y/Y. For reference the SP500 current and forward PE are ~19.5 and ~17, growth ~5-10%. 

So Tesla is growing and expected to grow earnings ~10x more than the SP500 but is only trading with a PE ~2x. This seems flawed to me. I have done screening and some comparison, but I’m sure some of you could say otherwise. 

Tesla is a car company, but it’s also much more. Not only are they leaders within the car industry they are outliers.",6324,True,1668390923.0,2022-11-14 02:55:23,0,86,carsonthecarsinogen,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yuln4j/i_want_peoples_opinions_on_tsla/,True,0.48,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

The 50k car purchase is exactly the kind of thing a upper middle class person would postpone if they’re concerned with the economy and potentially getting laid off. Additionally how many more rich people can buy a new Tesla every year that’s inherently diminishing year after year. I would also argue that the upper class is more likely to stockpile cash and buy appreciating assets during a recession than buy a depreciating one. Making financially smart decisions is probably somewhat correlational with being upper class.

Furthermore with higher interest rates auto loans are more of a risk and with potential defaults lenders will have stricter standards with lending which would reduce the pool of buyers.

Range - Huge win. I went from 270 to 340 miles, and faster charging. Add it all up and charging stops are about half as long as they used to be on road trips, since you can stay under 60 percent easier. Great!

Interior quality - Good improvement. Nicer materials. Everything is just a touch better. Still a small step down compared to my Genesis GV80, but it's fighting in the right league now.

Speed - Noticeably faster, even without plaid. Teslas are very fun to drive, and the refresh is better. 

Autopilot - Draw to slightly worse. I don't have the phantom braking issues I was expecting, and some parts work better, but there are a lot of small new bugs as well. Stop and go traffic, one of my biggest priorities, is worse as it slams on the brakes when someone 20 feet ahead slows down. I have to wonder if this is because they axed the radar. It ends up being slightly dangerous in city highway traffic jams. 

Controls - Disappointingly a little worse. No stalks, the yoke looks cool but isn't as functional, I'm tired of the button turn signals, I honk when turning on autopilot once a week, etc. These are just unforced errors, and while none are as bad as I feared, they are absolutely a small step back from a normal car.

Audio - Neutral. Was hoping for something a bit better, but no biggie.

Rear seat screen - It exists. Not really sure why it's there, or why there's a powerful GPU. Please give me more range instead. Kids don't really watch it because it's strangely positioned.

Suspension - A bit better. Again, not bad, but not as good as the GV80.

360 surround view - how is this still not a feature?

7 seat vs 6 seat - 3 wide second row is great if you have 3 kids. 3rd row is worse, but if you can use it a lot less, 7 seats is the way to go.

comment,yw85ie,yw85ie,,"Agree with most of your post! I also went from a 2018 X to a 2022 X. 

Range - The faster charging was a huge huge bonus. We had a 75D and never realized how much slower the charging rate was. We recently went on a short road trip with the 2022 and the much improved supercharging speed was a welcomed improvement.

Controls - I got used to the yoke very quickly. While there are some who actually prefer the yoke (from reading reviews), I would have loved to have a regular steering wheel as an option. The biggest drawback, in my opinion, is not having a shifting stalk. Trying to do a three point turn in a small parking garage is not much fun using the 'swipe' shifter. I also really miss using the left and right buttons on the 75D's regular steering wheel - especially the climate controls. I find voice control for the climate can be hit or miss and having to use the centre screen for the majority of climate controls can be dangerous at times.

Build Quality - My particular build was tremendously improved compared to my 2018 75D. The 2018 had trim issues, misaligned doors, unclipped plastic pieces, just to name a few. Our 2022 was pristine. The overall interior build material and quality, while not 'luxurious' per se compared to other luxury brands, is noticeably better.

post,ywszzf,,Where and how to pitch art to investors?,"My friend is an Artist and probably a genius.

He's semi-hidden in village in Portugal and just paints all the time. He's 75.

I would like to sell some of his paintings but don't really know where to start.

The traditional ""gallery route"" is not very suitable. The painter hates the art world in its modern format and tends to think that gallerists are exploitative parasites (he had some bad experiences early on).

Any advice would help, thanks.

There are funds which buy middle-high end paintings and then liquidate about 10 years later to try and capture art appreciation beta, sort of like late 19th century mutual funds.  There is a discussion to be had about art as an alternative since it is a high returning only semi-correlating asset. Moving lots of art from one individual not well known painter you are just talking to the wrong crowd.  A book I've heard good things about for the European market written in English: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IM933E/

post,yzct79,,Tesla Model Y Postmortem (2 years of ownership),"After two years, I decided to ditch my MY 7 seater. Tesla has agreed to buy it back, and I’ve just finished signing the paper work. It’s been two years, and my heating/ac has never worked for longer than a spell of 2-4 weeks. I’ve had around eight service appointments, at different Tesla service stations to try to resolve it. On at least two of those visits, the climate control service warning came on within 24hrs of picking up the car. It’s bittersweet, as there are things about this car that I truly love, but, ultimately I’ve lost hope that they would ever be able to fix this issue. After two years, I thought it would be nice to put together a postmortem on my Tesla experience.

## The Good
* **Driving Dynamics** - My previous car was an ’08 Nissan Altima, so this was my first time having a sporty car. I really loved how fast it was. The steering wheel is great. It’s a little smaller than the average steering wheel, and combined with the tightness of the wheel, you really feel in control of the car. I hate driving cars that feel like they have a mushy steering wheel, one that you have to over turn to get the car to react. That is definitely not the case here. I’ve heard some complaints that it’s too tight, but I did not find that to be the case.
* **One Pedal Driving** - After using this, I cannot go back. I considered getting a hybrid after giving up on my Tesla, but I just don’t think I can go back to coasting, breaking, and having to putz around with the gas pedal. One pedal driving is an amazing experience, and Tesla nails it. 
* **Cargo Space** - This car had enough space, and seating that we didn’t need to cart our minivan on long road trips and vacations. The last road trip we did involved five people, a 40lb dog, the dog’s crate, and four pieces of luggage. Everything fit, and really with room to spare.  
* **20” induction tires** - These are beautiful. Probably the nicest looking thing on this car.",7375,True,1668867255.0,2022-11-19 15:14:15,843,517,LvstForLife,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/yzct79/tesla_model_y_postmortem_2_years_of_ownership/,True,0.89,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

&#x200B;

After almost five years (Jan 2018, serial number under 5000), I sold my 2018 Model 3 LR RWD last weekend.   I was a Musk/Tesla cheerleader when I got it and I have become… something else… in the meantime. I'll attempt to keep this on the topic of my actual vehicle experience for the most part.

&#x200B;

# The Good

* **Performance** \- It's zippy in a straight line until you get to extralegal speeds, and stays reasonably well composed in the corners when driving aggressively.
* **One pedal driving** \- Like the other guy, I REALLY liked this.  I will miss it and am not looking forward to having to use my brake pedal more.
* **Mobile app** \- Worked well for the most part (exceptions to be mentioned elsewhere).
* **Autopilot (Just Autosteer, TACC, and driver-initiated automatic lane changes. The rest to be discussed elsewhere)**\- This was the reason I bought the car and for the first couple of years, it steadily improved.   I still have no regrets buying the car + autopilot (basic autopilot wasn't included back then, it cost me an extra $5k).
* **Sound system** \- I'm no audiophile but pretty good to me.
* **Nav/charging integration** \- This made switching to an EV pretty simple, the car would generally figure out where I'd need to stop and charge, and it got better at it over time.
* **Overall reliability** \- Not the best I've had on a new car, but far from the worst.   Never left me stranded, never had a major feature stop working.
* **Frunk -** What a great, great place to keep things you need to have with you, but don't need to access every day.
* **TPMS -** It's difficult to express how pleased I was and am with how good the implementation of that is.",7691,True,1668911597.0,2022-11-20 03:33:17,520,358,run-the-joules,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/yzsyar/tesla_model_3_postmortem_5_years_of_ownership/,True,0.9,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

post,z08ifs,,12-month Ownership Review: 2008 Saab 9-3 Turbo X,"First of all, here are some photos: [Imgur Gallery](https://imgur.com/gallery/PWX5QIK)

Today marks one year of owning my Turbo X (and daily driving it)! Happy anniversary to my favorite car.

Saab - you don't get it until you do. And I can say that now I totally get it. There's a reason Saab drivers have a massive grin on their face when they're behind the wheel. I apologize in advance if this gets long, but I have a lot to say about this fantastically unique vehicle.

**First off, about the Turbo X, and what makes it different from any other 9-3.**

The Turbo X was only produced for the 2008 model year in celebration of 30 years of turbocharged Saabs. This was also the first Saab to feature the XWD system - Saab's proprietary 4-wheel drive system.

The Turbo X differed from a standard 9-3 with more power, stiffer suspension, carbon fiber effect trim, and larger brakes. It also features a different turbo gauge from the standard 9-3 which takes inspiration from the classic 900 Turbo. Only 2,081 production models were produced, of which 632 were imported to the States.

   * **Load Area Protection Package $450**:

comment,z4h7mf,z4h7mf,,"From the article: Tesla has finally taken steps to fight back against owners who disregard their warnings and disclaimers and use Autopilot cheat devices to trick the car into thinking their hands are on the wheel.
With the latest release of Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta, the car can now detect if you are using an Autopilot cheat device and initiate a forced Autopilot disengagement, resulting in a strike if it happened while FSD Beta was engaged.

Since Autopilot was introduced, if you did not have your hands on the steering wheel the car would remind (or nag) you to apply force so that it knows you are still there and paying attention.

Tesla has been able to figure this out and your car can now detect when at least some of these devices are being used. According to third-party software tracker Teslascope, this new code was added with the latest FSD Beta 10.69.3.1.
This information has been corroborated by Tesla Service employees.
Tesla obviously didn’t include this new ability in the release notes, and has not officially announced it is there, so we don’t know for sure how they are detecting these devices.

One possibility is that Tesla knows when your hands are off the wheel (no force), and they also know with a high level of confidence when your hands on the wheel (varying force).",1504,True,1669393023.0,2022-11-25 17:17:03,98,0,chrisdh79,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/z4h7mf/tesla_cracks_down_on_autopilot_cheat_devices_as/ixqsad8/,True,,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,ixqsad8

post,z4tty2,,Model Y Performance ownership wrapup (2 years),"I recently traded in my MYP after two years and roughly 24,000 miles and wanted to share my ownership thoughts and some of the highlights and lowlights of the car.  This assessment is coming from a long-time car enthusiast and not an EV evangelist or EV hater.

I’ve done my best to leave out commentary on the community and the management of the company–while both of those factored into my personal decision to get rid of the car I wanted to focus on the merits of the car itself.

Tl;dr:  EVs do performance, packaging, and livability really well.  And they are going to be the future.  But my next EV is going to be from somebody other than Tesla.

***The good***:

* **Storage and interior space**:  
   * Between the massive under-trunk bin, the funk, and the flat rear passenger floor there is just an obscene amount of space for cargo.  I don’t think anything else can touch the MY for the sheer amount of discrete storage spaces.  Interior passenger space is also very open and roomy.
* **Acceleration**:  
   * Far quicker than any car its size has a right to be and the #1 reason I bought the car in the first place.  Power is accessible instantaneously and without drama–no launch control cheating, just stomp the long pedal and go. 
   * It’s the first car I’ve owned where I didn’t get used to/bored with the acceleration over time–it’s quick enough off the line that it just hits at a visceral level.  While acceleration falls off quickly over 60-70mph, there is more than enough for effortless passing at highway speeds.
* **One-pedal driving**:  
   * Love it.  In my daily commuting I would almost never touch the brake pedal.  The OPD is super dialed-in and very easy to modulate.  And it was downright fun to get the “perfect stop” where you rely only on regen and stop the car right on the mark.
* **Running costs**:

Hi guys, I'm not even sure if this is the right place to ask but I figured there's no reason not to.

I own a small business fixing semi trucks. We were working with a regular customer who's having light problems with his semi truck. It has a similar fuse box to 9 other trucks he owns. We dived into a light problem on a new vehicle he has and found out it has a serious problem in the fuse box. Because of the lack of availability of the fuse box from suppliers (it's old, we didn't know anything really about it, and we didn't want to leave him hanging for his own business) we completely tore the whole thing down so we could understand how everything operates and made it work to keep his business moving. 

In total we spent about 18 hours testing everything, getting the vehicle functional through bypasses. Typically we charge 145$ an hour.  Approximately 6-8 hours weren't testing/diagnostics. 

I don't want to charge the customer 2500$ because we were learning a lot during the process. Does anyone have any anecdotes about similar situations, or even better, a formula to use in situations like this?",1216,False,1670214799.0,2022-12-05 05:33:19,1,3,ZealousidealLeg3692,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/zcwxps/small_business_decision_18_hours_into_a_job/,True,1.0,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,zg7c4g,,The bottom is in. Just keep dcaing into indexes and in 20 years you'll have a lot more money.. Easy,"The bottom is always in when your outlook is 20 years from now my friends!

The best way to make money long term is to keep buying in small amounts each week into and index.

Ignore Cnbc! They're in business to keep people watching. Yes, you can learn some things and get a general market sense, etc,but take everything you hear with a grain of salt!

Remember that the people they have on are usually trying to pump their own stocks or get you to go along with their investing thesis,not to help YOU, but to make money for themselves. That's just my opinion.

Anyways I have about 20 good companies that I average down in but I'm slowly coming around to the idea of indexing a larger portion and just dcaing.

Some indexes I like are VTI QQQ QTEC IGV XLV IBB.

Then I have mostly blue chips like UNH MSFT AAPL GOOGL NVDA LIN UNP COST ASML LRCX etc.

But I think for the average investor with a 10 to 20 year look out, the ""bottom"" is NOW.

I mean by that that when you look back 5, 10 and 20 years from now most indexes and good companies will be a ""bottom"" compared to where they'll be in those.time frames.

So for the average investor seriously you're best bet to be successful long term is to pick an index or two, not a sector, but a broad index or two like say VTI and QQQ and just do a 50/50 weekly.

For example if you inest $100 A week, just put $50 into VTI  and QQQ each week and get on with life. You're not concerned with what happens next week, next month etc. You just keep buying!

So if you throw $50 into QQQ and it's  ""crashes"" 50% next week .... awesome!!! THATS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY!!

Always keep positive and have a positive outlook on life. Keep yourself fit and as healthy as possible and don't eat a lot of junk. Try to eat as little as you can. That's what I do now. I fast every day for at least 12 hours.

So keep buying into indexes. If you want to mess with individual  stocks I think you should keep it to about 20% of your portfolio  and maybe under 20 positions.",2424,True,1670524762.0,2022-12-08 19:39:22,0,27,apooroldinvestor,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zg7c4g/the_bottom_is_in_just_keep_dcaing_into_indexes/,True,0.43,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

If an algorithm makes a mistake and serves you the wrong ad, you probably won't even notice. And even for these low stakes applications, companies like Meta and Google are struggling with unintended outcomes like strongly biased and outright racist outputs of the algorithms.

post,zmaf5o,,Stock Market - Economy Discussion,"Don’t have anyone to personally discuss this with so to Reddit I go…

My understanding is that even earnings contraction to a historically semi-normal level ($200 per share for SP500) at a 17x PE would only bring us slightly below the lows of this year.   Would be a drop from where we are, but not crippling.  Any form of recession would also possibly push the Fed closer to a pause, then pivot?  The “higher for longer” rhetoric from Jerome Powell seems to signal that they’re willing to allow a bit of pain, but at this point who believes the Fed?  What are the odds a “financial accident” occurs and really hits the economy?  Which brings me to my next point..

In a deeper recession, could we see a bit more PE contraction (say 15-16x) and SP500 EPS drop to $175?  What evidence is there for a deep recession vs. a mild recession?  Household debt levels, layoffs, past due mortgage rates, etc?  Which area seems like the last straw?  We had the BoE and UK Pension event a bit ago, Credit Suisse still seeming to raise red flags (both overseas)… What could be the “thing” that buckles the US economy and sends us into a deeper recession than most currently expect?

ASML is a monopoly essentially that sells the machine needed for semiconductor design etching. Very good companies, but a little pricey on the valuation.

TSM is a near monopoly because it fabricates the most advanced semiconductor chips in the world. Seems to be either undervalued or at least fair value imo.

NVDA is a great company and has a near monopoly in consumer and server GPUs. Probably the most risky of the semiconductor stocks though since its valuation is predicated on AI software growth. Overvalued imo.

post,zublia,,TSLA - Bull Case (Qualitative Opinion),"A lot of posts about folks dumping Tesla. Here are some counter points. I welcome feedback! Please be civil. 

1.	I sincerely doubt people are shying away from Tesla because of Elon. Even if they are, it is a short term phenomenon because of his involvement in Twitter. Like all stupid forays, this foray will come to an end as well and money will rush back in again. 

2.	Tesla makes great cars. Buyers remorse is almost non existent. People love their cars, flaws and all! There isn’t a car that is anywhere close to it from a technology perspective. (you may debate this - but find me a car that has a greater range + capabilities)

3.	Tesla does not spend a dime on advertising! Just think of the brand awareness and consideration this company has without spending a dime on advertising. Others are spending billions! Even Porsche who I think is the closest competition has billboards all over the place!

4.	They are profitable! This is not a smoke and mirror show. Maybe you say that the autopilot is a joke and not a fully featured solution. The retort would be, how many people are paying for FSD via subscription and what is the cancellation rate? It is near 5%. If Tesla is able to retain 95% of its customer base in something “frivolous” like FSD, surely there is something that FSD is doing correctly. 

5.	Tesla cars are priced where they are because of demand and supply. They are able to presell every car they produce. Obviously, the recession may cause some havoc and reduce demand in the short term. How will Tesla weather this? Based on the moves they are making, it feels like they are taking an active approach to managing staff, expenses and ultimately production. The drop in stock price is because of this! This is the uncertainty that is causing the institutional investors to reduce their positions. 

6.	Tesla has experienced meteoric growth and with the growth comes “fat” (ask any body builder).",4294,True,1671894355.0,2022-12-24 16:05:55,0,161,Infoaddict2012,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zublia/tsla_bull_case_qualitative_opinion/,True,0.47,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

post,zygheu,,"9"" HUD similar to Hansshow/Verkokappa - not connecting to MY bluetooth","Hi, I recently bought and installed a HUD similar to those from hansshow/ verkokappa, but directly from a supplier in China. Everything works perfectly (android auto, changing settings etc) but my Model Y will not connect to it no matter what I try. I have:

1. Disconnected all previous bluetooth connections in my tesla, tried to connect the car to BT-TSLA, but it fails
2. Turned off phone bluetooth so that the HUD has no connection, then tried to connect car to BT-TSLA,  it fails.
3. Updated the firmware to the latest, which at the time of writing is 3.17. Still fails. (the picture is before updating to 3.17, but same result regardless) 

At every step I have done a hard restart, holding both scroll wheels and the brake for 20 seconds. Attached some pictures for reference.

Any help or tips is greatly appreciated :)

post,zz8vg9,,Tesla stock analysis and valuation - including DIY valuation,"Well, it took a bit, but finally here's my full analysis of Tesla.

***Disclaimer: I have a small position in Tesla with an average price of around $150/share.***

The post covers the following:

1. Introduction
2. Fundamental analysis of Tesla's automotive business, including cars sold, capacity, and future investments required.
3. Competitive landscape (profitability, debt & future growth/ROIC)
4. Historical financial performance
5. Assumptions & valuation
6. Valuation based on assumptions different than mine

&#x200B;

**Introduction**

I'd describe Tesla as a car company with big dreams and impressive technology. There are bulls and bears with different assumptions about the future, but if we look backward, there's no doubt that as a company, it disrupted the industry and accelerated the transition to EVs.

It operates in two segments, automotive (responsible for 96% of the revenue and almost all the gross profit) and energy generation and storage (attributing the remaining 4% of the revenue).

Now, I mentioned big dreams. That's of course, coming from Elon Musk. Let's take a look at a few of them:

1. FSD (Full self-driving capability) & robotaxis - Tesla was to some extent the first mover in this area and is likely the company with the most data. However, in my opinion, the competitors are catching up. As for the robotaxis, there's still some time until it becomes a reality and when it happens, Tesla won't be the only player on the market.
2. The ""energy generation and storage"" segment is to be worth as much as the automotive segment - Another big prediction that so far seems to have an incredibly low probability. Its current size is insignificant, it's not a profitable segment, and in order to become a significant portion of Tesla's value, well, it will take a long time.
3. Optimus - The humanoid robot is expected to be on sale by 2027 with a cost of $20k.",13025,True,1672427878.0,2022-12-30 20:17:58,96,91,k_ristovski,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zz8vg9/tesla_stock_analysis_and_valuation_including_diy/,True,0.82,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

comment,zz8vg9,zz8vg9,,"Good critical analysis, thank you for sharing. I have some comments you could check out if you want:

>The Berlin factory cost around $5b and comes with a capacity of 250k cars.

I think if you look at floor space compared to Shanghai capacity is over 1 million at least, even more for Giga Texas. Don't forget that Shanghai was also guided at 250k capacity. This is because ramping takes infinite time and effort+includes risk, so best to say a low number. Especially in slower ramp rate/permit/anything locations like Germany. Feel free to quantify floorspace and ramp rate etc. if you don't believe. I think terminally Berlin 1.5 million, Texas 2 million or more depending what they place in the building.

>If Tesla wants to increase capacity by 4m units, they need to invest roughly $80b.

Capex per vehicle went down each factory generation, feel free to quantify if you don't believe. If they make a cheaper vehicle I expect significant savings in this aspect also, knowing about gigapress.

>35% in the next 12 months

Time will tell, I see the recession. Perhaps they will have big problems. However, there is also upside if factories in Texas/Berlin ramp, margins improve. And if dollar weakens, or china economy strengthens, china profits increase. Furthermore operating leverage increases the more cars they make.

You value the new technology at 10% but that's fine since it is risky business valueing it.

post,10d1egl,,I Drove All The Way From Boston To Montreal Just To Check Out And Do A Thorough Tour On The Vinfast VF 8,"Full review on YouTube coming soon:

Since I heard that there is a Vinfast store in Montreal, I decided to drive all the way from Boston to Montreal QC just to check out the Vinfast VF 8 and VF 9. Obviously, Vinfast has seen a lot of controversy both on YouTube as well as Reddit with many accusing it of vapourware and many thinking that it is DOA (dead on arrival), but the Vinfast showroom has seen a lot of consumer interest not only amongst Vietnamese people, but I have also met one Laotian family, one Cambodian family, as well as many people from different races and ethnicites. Since the full tour and review on YouTube would talk about the specs, I am only going to examine the pros and cons of this car to see if Vinfast even has a chance in the US market given the fact that Tesla dropped the price of the Model Y to about 53k for the Long Range Edition.

**Positive aspects of Vinfast:**

* The Vinfast VF 8 Plus does have a lot of safety features such as traffic jam assist, auto parking, and smart summon (debatable if these safety features really work or they are just vapourware) as well as a big 15.6 inch infotainment system with a browser, voice recognition, navigation, as well as OTA updates. The fully equipped VF 8 plus even comes with a power liftgate (VF 8 Eco however has a manual liftgate), a panoramic sunroof, vegan leather, power seats, an electronic gear shifter/parking brake, as well as a frunk, just like the Tesla Model Y.

The video, which remains archived on Tesla’s website, was released in October 2016 and promoted on Twitter by Chief Executive Elon Musk as evidence that “Tesla drives itself.”

To create the video, the Tesla used 3D mapping on a predetermined route from a house in Menlo Park, California, to Tesla’s then-headquarters in Palo Alto, he said.

Drivers intervened to take control in test runs, he said. When trying to show the Model X could park itself with no driver, a test car crashed into a fence in Tesla’s parking lot, he said.

“The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system,” Tesla's lawyer said, according to a transcript of his testimony seen by Reuters.

When Tesla released the video, Musk tweeted, “Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot.”

Tesla faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny over its driver assistance systems.

The U.S. Department of Justice began a criminal investigation into Tesla’s claims that its electric vehicles can drive themselves in 2021, after a number of crashes, some of them fatal, involving Autopilot, Reuters has reported.

The New York Times reported in 2021 that Tesla engineers had created the 2016 video to promote Autopilot without disclosing that the route had been mapped in advance or that a car had crashed in trying to complete the shoot, citing anonymous sources.",2891,True,1674047229.0,2023-01-18 14:07:09,2701,604,_DeanRiding,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10f6z7f/tesla_video_promoting_self_driving_was_staged/,True,0.91,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

post,10l9spv,,Tesla earnings are out — here are the numbers,"Electric vehicle maker Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings (adjusted): $1.19 vs $1.13 per share expected, per Refinitiv

Revenue: $24.32 billion vs $24.16 billion expected, per Refinitiv

In the year-ago quarter, Tesla reported revenue of $17.72 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.52 per share.

Earlier this month, Tesla reported vehicle delivery and production numbers for the fourth quarter of 2022 that set a new record for the company, but fell shy of the company’s goals and analysts’ expectations, despite having cut prices on its cars in December to spur customers to take deliveries before the year’s end.

Tesla reported 405,278 vehicle deliveries and production of 439,701 vehicles in the period ending December 31, 2022. Full year deliveries amounted to around 1.31 million, a record for Tesla, after the company started production at its new factories in Austin, Texas, and Brandenburg, Germany.

Last year, Musk said the factories were akin to “money-burning furnaces” in an interview with an owners’ club posted to YouTube in June.

So far in 2023, Tesla has continued to cut prices on its cars around the world, upsetting customers in the US and China who recently bought new Teslas at higher prices, and triggering an instant decline in used Tesla prices in the US as well.

Tesla solicits questions ahead of their earnings calls via a site called Say.com from both retail and institutional investors.

Among other things, investors on that site say they want to know what the recent price cuts will do to Tesla’s automotive gross margins, how much the company expects to grow sales of its cars in 2023, and when Tesla plans to start mass production and deliveries of its long-delayed, sci-fi inspired, pickup truck the Cybertruck.

post,10qpasz,,tesla counts fsd revenue when the vehicle is delivered to the customer before that it is deferred,It seems shocking to me that so many people down vote the last post I did so I went and looked up the quarterly report. When tesla gets paid for the full fsd it is classifies as deferred revenue until it is delivered to the customer and then it counts as revenue. Do people understand this? My last post was basically the same thing but someone said they don't count revenue since it's deferred in the quarterly report and that as upvoted but if you actually read it which apparently no one does that's not the case.

post,10qvkx6,,P85D battery issues - warranty ending tomorrow! Car currently in TSLA service (for 3 weeks) - Please help!,"Hi,

My 2015 P85D (69,xxx mi) has a working battery but the range is very poor. I typically get only ~110 miles per drive from 90% charge to 20%. Recently it's been below 100 mi during a mild winter, and that's driving in Chill mode 100% of the time, which I don't want to have to do, having bought the Model S Performance variant.

We have reported this to Tesla many times over the past 3-4 years, during every service visit, but they keep saying the battery pack is fine. They also refuse to share the specific battery degradation stats so far despite many requests.

Each time they just say they diagnosed it remotely. Local service center previously doesn't really look into it in person, they just say it's fine every time based on remote diagnosis and try to dismiss the issue.

My energy consumption is normal (low 300s wHr/mi), driving in Chill mode.

It's very frustrating to report this for 3+ years, deal with it, and have no progress.  Supercharging time is now very slow as well:  1h 45 min from 20% to 90%. It makes the car feel like a burden rather than like a real functional car that makes transportation easier.

I also bought a new model 3, and it never had this issue - in fact it would consistently get more than the stated range (with similar driving style).

I suspect my battery pack is failing, or one or more of the battery modules aren't functioning correctly.
I know the battery has to fail for it to be covered under warranty - however in my findings it is failing, at least in part, but not showing a fault.

What can I do to get a battery back replacement, if they say it's showing no errors and they don't want to fix it?


Other observed strange behavior:

1. From 20%, charging back up to 90%, the car will say it added +60 kW or so each time.  But when I drive, the car will not use 60 kwh, it is always less, and always says it takes in more charge back from 20% to 90% than the car states I used during the trip meter.

post,10sk1gh,,On Tesla's valuation (Part 4),"In the past I've made multiple posts on Tesla's valuation ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8ka1h/on_teslas_valuation_part_deux/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y8sdc4/on_teslas_valuation_part_trois/)).

Previously I did them after Q1 and Q3, but because the last few months have been such a rollercoaster for $TSLA and it probably makes more sense to do them after the full year numbers anyways, I decided to do this one a little bit earlier. In the future I'll just be doing them after H1 and H2.

-----------------

**Looking back**

Since my first projections started with 2022, this is the first time we can compare my projections to Tesla's actual results. As such, I figured it'd be interesting to assess how far off my projections were.

Combining the bear and bull cases for 2022 of each post into a table together with the actuals:

**Sales**

||Part 1|Part 2|Part 3|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Bear**|1,400,000|1,400,000|1,350,000|
|**Bull**|1,700,000|1,900,000|1,500,000|

Actuals: **1,313,851**

In terms of unit sales, my projections were definitely too optimistic. Tesla ended up slightly underperforming my bear cases, although a caveat here is that Tesla had 60K cars in transit at the end of 2022 and missed out on ~75K units due to COVID shutdowns in China. Without these one-time occurrences, they would've ended the year on ~1,450,000 units above my bear cases but still significantly below my bull cases.

That said, accounting for force majeure is supposed to be part of the bear case, so I need to be more conservative here in the future.

**ASP**

For ASPs, I projected $50,000, $55,000 and $54,000 respectively. Actuals came in at **$54,385**, so I was pretty much spot-on.",7131,True,1675430093.0,2023-02-03 14:14:53,30,21,Ehralur,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10sk1gh/on_teslas_valuation_part_4/,True,0.75,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

comment,10sk1gh,10sk1gh,,"Shanghai already has capacity to produce 1.2M today. Eventually they're expecting to reach 1.5M with the newly announced expansion, although that will still take a while.

Berlin and Texas are 3 and 8 times larger than Shanghai will be respectively, so eventually I expect them to do ~2M each. Berlin has already announced to hit 500K with the first of four stages, so that seems in line with my expectation.

I do think both Berlin and Texas will do a lot more than just cars, unlike Shanghai which is purely focused on cars. So that's why I don't expect them to do 3-8x more cars than Shanghai.

Then there's Fremont, which is expected to ramp to 800K over time. So adding all of those together, it's 6.3M cars with zero downtime. I don't expect them to be fully done by 2025, but by that time I do expect some production from one or two unannounced factories as well. Shanghai actually only took 10 months from start of construction to first deliveries, so it is possible in countries with less bureaucracy. In theory Tesla could announce a new factory at Investor Day in March and start production in early 2024 (although I don't expect this).

So in a ""everything goes perfectly"" scenario, 4.8M is a rough estimation of mainly the four existing factories plus maybe some production from 1 or 2 unannounced factories.

Again though, both the bull and bear numbers are numbers I expect to be extremely unlikely (maybe 5% chance each).",1513,True,1675441424.0,2023-02-03 17:23:44,6,0,Ehralur,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10sk1gh/on_teslas_valuation_part_4/j72g4n5/,True,,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,j72g4n5

post,113xc3n,,"Tesla recalls 362,758 vehicles, says full self-driving beta software may cause crashes","https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/16/tesla-recalls-362758-vehicles-says-full-self-driving-beta-software-may-cause-crashes.html

Tesla said Thursday it’s recalling “certain 2016-2023 Model S, Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving Beta (FSD Beta) software or pending installation.” The recall includes 362,758 vehicles.

The FSD Beta system may cause crashes by allowing the affected vehicles to: “act unsafe around intersections, such as traveling straight through an intersection while in a turn-only lane, entering a stop sign-controlled intersection without coming to a complete stop, or proceeding into an intersection during a steady yellow traffic signal without due caution,” according to the notice on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

The FSD Beta system may also have trouble responding appropriately “to changes in posted speed limits,” the notice said.

The group of affected vehicles included the following years and models: 2016-2023 Model S and Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with or pending installation of FSD Beta.

Tesla lets thousands of drivers try new and unfinished driver assistance features on public roads in the U.S. through FSD Beta. The technology does not make Tesla electric cars autonomous, nor safe to drive without a human at the wheel ready to brake or steer at any second — despite the brand name.

Only Tesla owners who have the company’s premium FSD driver assistance system installed in their cars can join the FSD Beta program. That option now costs $15,000 up front or $199 per month in the U.S. today. Owners must obtain a high driver-safety score, as determined by Tesla software that monitors their driving habits, and maintain it to get FSD Beta access.

FSD Beta can best be summarized as a host of new features that are not yet fully debugged.",2053,True,1676571941.0,2023-02-16 19:25:41,554,209,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/113xc3n/tesla_recalls_362758_vehicles_says_full/,True,0.84,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

comment,11el96v,11el96v,,"Speaking as someone who’s been privy to an actual Tesla benchmarking, the most impressive part of Tesla’s designs have nothing to do with the vehicle’s battery, drivetrain, or  the fact it was “designed to be an EV.”  It has to do with how consolidated and streamlined their controls architecture is, and you can generally tell whether praise of Tesla’s construction is rooted in actual subject matter expertise by whether they spotlight this.

Legacy automakers tend to build every single vehicle subsystem insularly.  That means your dash screen has one control module and wiring harness, each of your powered seats has one, and so on.  Tesla has always consolidated all these functions into only a couple control modules per vehicle, with all outputs being calculated by software and relayed back rather than processed “locally.” Each of these control modules is essentially a miniature computer, so Tesla’s model not only saves a lot of parts (in fact, it is **the** reason why they weathered the chip shortage so well), but makes systems integration leagues easier. 

This is a difference Munro mentions repeatedly during his Tesla teardowns, and the industry has quietly acknowledged is a big deal - everyone is trying to make the same shift now, and several former Tesla controls people have shown up in high positions at legacies.

Since then, the changes we've seen in the EVs have been very incremental. Yes, the battery, especially in the model Y has improved a little bit, and perhaps there are other changes coming in the next year. However nothing revolutionary appears to be around the corner, unless of course I'm mistaken.

Hyundai/Kia - the Ioniq 5 and EV6 will likely be quickly forgotten in 5 years time.

Ford - they seem to be making waves in the truck department, but nothing that would surpass a Tesla in a sedan or SUV form

GM - they're going for value for sure, but I'm not aware of anything in their pipeline that would be seen as revolutionary

VW/Audi - they're making EVs because they're forced to as a result of the dieselgate settlement. Definitely nothing earth shattering from them

Polestar - this is interesting, everything they build looks very nice from a design perspective but it feels very niche, nothing that will gain significant market share

Tesla on Sunday posted its first-quarter vehicle production and delivery report for 2023.

Here are the key numbers from the electric vehicle maker:

Total deliveries Q1 2023: 422,875

Total production Q1 2023: 440,808

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by Tesla and are not broken out by individual model or region.

The first quarter numbers represent a 36% increase in deliveries compared to the 310,048 reported during the same period a year earlier, and 4% growth in deliveries sequentially compared to the 405,278 they company reported in the last quarter of 2022.

The company reported deliveries of 10,695 of its higher-priced Model S and X vehicles, about 2% of deliveries in the quarter.

Tesla reported deliveries of 412,180 of its lower priced Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover during the quarter.

The company did not include production and delivery numbers for its heavy-duty Semi trucks. 

Tesla said it produced 19,437 Model S and X vehicles, and 421,371 of its Model 3 and Y vehicles for the period ending March 31, 2023.

“We continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds,” the company wrote in a statement Sunday.

Tesla now sells four models which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the US, one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin. In March, CEO Elon Musk announced the company plans to build a new factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from its factory in Austin, Texas.

The company also produces a heavy-duty truck, the Semi, at its battery plant in Sparks, Nevada. The company began deliveries of the Semi in December 2022.

According to a mean of estimates, compiled by FactSet as of Friday, Wall Street was expecting Tesla to report deliveries around 432,000 vehicles for the quarter. Estimates included in the FactSet analysis ranged from 410,000 to 451,000 deliveries expected.",2663,True,1680455896.0,2023-04-02 19:18:16,436,459,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/129rlfw/tesla_reports_422875_deliveries_for_first_quarter/,True,0.9,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

post,12ekzkx,,Tesla cuts U.S. prices for fifth time since January.,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/07/tesla-cuts-us-prices-for-fifth-time-since-january.html

Tesla cut prices in the United States between 2% and nearly 6%, its website showed on Thursday, as the company extends a discount drive on its electric vehicles that analysts caution could hurt profitability. The fifth such cut in Tesla’s largest market since the start of the year comes as the United States prepares to adopt tougher standards this month that are expected to limit EV tax credits. Tesla cut prices on both versions of its Model 3 sedan by $1,000 and on its Model Y crossover by $2,000, the website showed. It also cut prices on both versions of its more expensive Model S and Model X by $5,000. The company has said the tougher U.S. standards would reduce the $7,500 tax credit available for its base, rear-wheel drive Model 3 since January.

Some analysts who expected the further price cuts had flagged concern that Tesla’s industry-leading profit margins could be at risk. This week Tesla reported first-quarter deliveries of almost 423,000 vehicles, up just 4% from the prior quarter after price cuts in the United States, China and other markets aiming to spur demand. Tesla has set a target of 1.8 million deliveries this year. Tesla has cut the price of its base Model 3 by a cumulative 11% since the start of the year, with a 20% reduction on its base Model Y.",1374,False,1680873337.0,2023-04-07 15:15:37,2387,860,WickedSensitiveCrew,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12ekzkx/tesla_cuts_us_prices_for_fifth_time_since_january/,True,0.95,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,12kkdkr,,Why Tesla is losing its EV dominance ?," 

Tesla ($TSLA) should be looking over its shoulder at the fully charged EVs barreling right toward its castle.

While Elon Musk's non-Twitter creation still has a stronghold on the EV market based on name recognition, market share, and production capabilities, the clear takeaway from this year’s New York International Auto Show (which Tesla was not a part of) is that traditional automakers such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Nissan (NSANY) are all gunning for Tesla's dominance and lucrative profit margins. 

## Hyundai aims to lead the EV pack

“Tesla who,” Hyundai Motor Americas CEO Randy Parker quipped when Yahoo Finance Live asked about Hyundai's IONIQ 6, an EV that was named 'Car of the Year' for 2023.

The impressive specs and pricing of Hyundai's IONIQ 6 places it in direct competition with Tesla's Model 3, the second-most-popular EV in the U.S. Hyundai's IONIQ 6 starts at $41,600 with a range of up to 240 miles. By comparison, the $41,990 Model 3 reaches 272 miles on one charge.

Gap closed.

“The IONIQ 6 from a technology standpoint, you can’t do better,” Parker crowed.

And it’s that type of Tesla mentality that’s likely to test the EV leadership of Musk's EV outfit.

Older automakers known for their gas-powered rides are ramping up their push into the EV market with edgy new styles and attractive specs like those showcased at this year's New York Auto Show, including the Kia EV9, Nissan Ariya, Chevrolet Equinox EV, and Ram 1500 REV electric truck.

These will be added to a class of solid EVs already in the market like Ford's F-150 Lightning and Mach-E and the coming Chevy Silverado.

## What's next for Tesla

Tesla's Cybertruck isn't even on the market yet. The company is reportedly working on a compact EV dubbed the Model 2, but it's unclear when that will arrive. 

S&P Global estimates the EV market will grow from just over 50 models today to 78 by year-end before more than doubling to 160 by the end of 2025.",4278,True,1681382178.0,2023-04-13 12:36:18,0,126,ProcedureFun410,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12kkdkr/why_tesla_is_losing_its_ev_dominance/,True,0.37,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

post,12qztiy,,Tesla Club Sweden visits Giga Berlin,"Original article in Swedish, by Tibor Blomhäll, founder of Tesla Club Sweden.
https://teslaclubsweden.se/rundtur-i-berlinfabriken/

tl;dr – We got to visit Giga Berlin and it was awesome!

[Together with Tesla Club Sweden I went to Giga Berlin last Friday. Tibor wrote a good article, which I am providing a translation of, and adding some of my own comments to, like this. @bjelkeman]

Tesla invited us at Tesla Club Sweden to a tour of their car factory outside Berlin last Friday. Today's article is about the factory, tomorrow we will tell you more about what else we did in Berlin. [We were told that the Tesla clubs where used as beta testers for the tour and we were the second club to get a tour.]

The factory is perhaps best known as Giga Berlin, although its official name is actually Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg to indicate that it is technically located 4 km outside Berlin's city limits.

Immediately upon arriving at the factory, you realize that Giga Berlin is as much a construction site as a car factory. The huge factory building is already being expanded and has also been joined by separate buildings where electric motors and battery packs are manufactured. [The huge car park is partially completed. You walk across somewhat of a building site to get to the security hut. The nice entrance to the factory isn’t finished yet. It is clear that they are prioritizing the building of cars!]

Unfortunately we were not allowed to take any pictures inside the factory, the pictures you see here are from Giga Berlin's opening party two years ago.

The first stop at the factory was the huge machine that stamps out body parts such as doors, body sides or engine hoods from sheets of sheet metal. The guide showed that next to the machine they were assembling another equally large machine that will double the production capacity.

Right now, around 5,000 cars are manufactured a week in Giga Berlin.",8840,True,1681843441.0,2023-04-18 20:44:01,1,1,bjelkeman,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/12qztiy/tesla_club_sweden_visits_giga_berlin/,True,0.6,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,12s8m77,,Tesla net income and earnings drop more than 20% from last year,"Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv

Revenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates

Net income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.

Automotive revenue, Tesla’s core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.

Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.

The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.

Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.

Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.


Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management’s consideration were seeking updates on the company’s trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company’s energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.

In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.

A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas.",2607,True,1681935275.0,2023-04-19 22:14:35,3463,871,Kashyapm94,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12s8m77/tesla_net_income_and_earnings_drop_more_than_20/,True,0.94,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

post,13l5gc0,,[D] The Question facing Nvidia,"The problem this stock faces is no one knows how to value it.

The company are investing in technology that opens up new markets (AI, Omniverse and self driving for example).  Will those markets pan out or will they go bust?  And if they do pan out, what's the value of those markets?    Nobody knows, these markets haven't been served before.

Today's share price is a reflection of the market sentiment, the voting machine's results as of this moment.   The current share price is either grossly over extended or grossly undervalued -- there is no in between in my opinion.

I believe Nvidia has cemented itself as the hardware technology leadership company of the era, much like IBM and Intel of past decades.   Some on Wall St understand this, others are coming to understand it.  But there are many who doubt that is the case as well.

The most obvious question from doubters is about competition:  Won't AMD or Intel or Google or Apple just come in with better technology and take their position?

I've been invested in this company for more than 15 years and what they do uniquely are two things:  1.  Strategize and 2.  Execute.   They have been building a GPGPU platform (General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit), otherwise known as ""accelerated computing"" since about 2007.   It's different from standard CPUs in that it processes massive amounts of data in parallel, tens of thousands of ""cores"" operating at the same time.  Their platform is a combination of inter-generational compatible hardware and software.  The platform is robust, reliable, well supported, offers regular performance improvements, and is now ubiquitous with over 4million developers using it including nearly every AI developer on the planet.

So when a competitor comes to throw their hat in the ring, there is an enormous defensive position to overcome that includes a large user base who are getting reliable, quantifiable and predictable results.",4107,True,1684431597.0,2023-05-18 19:39:57,92,54,norcalnatv,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/13l5gc0/d_the_question_facing_nvidia/,True,0.85,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,13nxvrt,,Covering Frame Rust - Tips to keep it from getting worse,"I recently bought a used vehicle from Canada that apparently was washed only from the “top down”, so the body and paint looks great, but the frame and subframe does have some good rust beyond just surface rust. 

It’s a 2020 model year so it’s not too advanced yet, but looking ahead several years down the road, I don’t want to let it get worse and become a structural issue. 

What I would like to do is thoroughly clean the underside to get rid of any leftover salt brine left in any crevices, and then coat it with some sort of rust reformer or preventative to keep it from getting worse.

My question is looking for tips on what coating would work best to keep the rust from advancing further. 

I’m aware typical rubberized undercoating is the worst thing to apply, as it essentially traps moisture against the metal and causes rust to  accelerate. I’ve heard of fluid film wool wax, which is supposed to provide a moisture displacing coating that will stop of chemical process of iron converting to rust, but I’m curious if anyone has any real-world results to back their claims up. 


It’s worth mentioning the vehicle is now in the southern US and will seldomly if ever be exposed to salt again in the future. Please no suggestions for “pull the body and sandblast the entire frame back to metal”, as I don’t have the time to money for that.

The Roadster kinda intrigues me as a garage queen weekend toy.  I could pay cash but man, that's a ton of $ wrapped up in just 2 depreciating assets.  

Also, dunno how much of an added experience it would be since I already have a Plaid.  Sure, a bit faster and of course light years ahead in handling, but I'm just a city street driver, no auto-x, track days, so the true Roadster legs would never really be stretched other than highway on ramps.

post,1493mza,,Tesla stock extends record streak to 13 sessions,"Tesla shares are up a whopping 41% during that time.

  
Tesla ($TSLA) shares jumped 3.6% today, extending the company’s record winning streak to 13 sessions in a row. In that time, shares have risen nearly 42%, adding further gains to an already big year for Tesla shareholders.

  
Tesla stock is rising in tandem with the overall market today on cooling inflation data, but the shares have been on the rise for a couple weeks now. The latest big news came late last week when General Motors (GM) announced it was joining forces with Tesla to leverage the electric vehicle maker's Supercharger Network. The companies announced the Tesla Supercharger Network will be open to GM EV drivers starting next year, and by 2025 GM anticipates its EVs will include Tesla’s NACs connector, which will allow for direct access to Tesla Superchargers.

GM’s move comes two weeks after Ford (F) announced a similar partnership with Tesla to enable access for Ford vehicles to Tesla's charging network.  
Several industry analysts recently told Yahoo Finance that Tesla's partnership with Ford would be a positive tailwind for Tesla's revenue moving forward.  
""Recall in our 2022 report that we sized the potential for Tesla opening its network more widely in the next few years (i.e. more than just Ford) at $1-$3 bn of incremental revenue (although Tesla wouldn’t necessarily capture all of this),"" Goldman analyst Mark Delaney wrote in a note following the Ford deal. ""We believe the news is a modest incremental positive for Tesla as it will likely bring in additional profits and help Tesla to sustain the most robust charging network, albeit with some risk of fewer vehicle sales.""Nonetheless it hasn’t all been good news for Tesla during the recent run-up, as the stock brushed aside negative reports about the upcoming and highly anticipated Cybertruck.",2800,True,1686736088.0,2023-06-14 11:48:08,550,283,Ben_aid,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1493mza/tesla_stock_extends_record_streak_to_13_sessions/,True,0.88,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

post,149ifrq,,"Chinese EV giant BYD overtakes Tesla, but can it crack the U.S. market? (Washington Post)","By Meaghan Tobin, Lyric Li

Thai YouTube star Jo Chirawatt recently took two of the best-selling electric cars in Thailand for a test drive. One was Tesla’s Model 3. The other was the Atto 3, made by Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD.

The Atto 3 marked “the iPhone moment” for EVs, Chirawatt told his nearly 900,000 YouTube followers, suggesting it would set off a hype cycle that would transform a novelty purchase into a mainstream luxury. For most of the world, previous generations of EVs were aspirational purchases.

From Bangkok to Tel Aviv, BYD — which stands for “Build Your Dreams” — has been pushing to make EVs mass-market.

The Chinese car company, which has also sold low-priced gasoline-powered cars for more than a decade, has this year surpassed Tesla to become the top-selling EV brand in the world.

At the Shanghai auto show in April, the company’s biggest bid yet to capture the global market for affordable EVs was unveiled in the tiniest package, with the lowest price tag: a compact battery-powered hatchback called the Seagull that sells for just over $11,000.

“The Seagull was the shot heard around the world when it comes to affordability of electric vehicles,” said Bill Russo, founder and chief executive of the Shanghai-based advisory firm Automobility.

This year has marked a moment of arrival not just for BYD but for the much-maligned Chinese auto sector as a whole.

The country exported 1.07 million cars in the first quarter of this year, according to China’s Association of Automobile Manufacturers — overtaking Japan to become the world’s top auto exporter.

One out of every four of those cars was electric. BYD models are now the top-selling electric vehicles in Thailand, Israel, New Zealand and Singapore.

Like many Chinese tech companies before it, BYD has targeted fast-growing emerging markets without strong local brands. It did the same with its earlier gas-powered cars, selling across South America, Africa and the Middle East.",6813,True,1686775016.0,2023-06-14 22:36:56,2,12,bitemy,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/149ifrq/chinese_ev_giant_byd_overtakes_tesla_but_can_it/,True,0.57,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

post,14aicet,,who knows about the tesla battery and motor compatibility of the original tesla roadster and a model 3?,"this probably isnt the subreddit to ask but the 2 subreddits dedicated to this car are both under 50 people, are basically vacant, and only approved people can post, so ill have to do it here hoping someone knowledgeable can advise me on this

so I found this surprisingly affordable 2008 tesla roadster and I started thinking about the possibility of doing a motor and possibly a battery swap with a more modern tesla.

&#x200B;

The battery portion would obviously be a lot of work, but with how modular tesla batteries are, it might be possible to take it all apart to its bare cells, and basically reconstruct the battery with a new battery housing following the basic structure of the original casing, only made to fit the shape of the one found int he roadster. that of course would be quite difficult, but my question is would it be doable. and probably the easier side of the equation, a model s or model 3 motor swap. i would have to get one that didn't have 2 speed transmission to ""simplify"" things, but would it be possible and would i or would i not be incredibly frowned upon for doing that to a roadster. and the last thing and the easiest of all, since i would be replacing the battery and the motor, might as well upgrade the charge port to NACS as well.

So, if there are any knowledgeable tesla roadster owners out there in this thread or at least someone who knows a good deal about the tesla roadster, how possible would this be. its a very analog car, so i imagine there wouldnt be too much software interference, but of course, adding a new drivetrain and battery might not take too kindly to the old computers in the car. and im assuming the likelihood of this being possible is near zero since many tesla roadsters were actually taken apart in order to use them for parts to fix existing tesla roadsters, but doesnt hurt to ask.",1853,False,1686875586.0,2023-06-16 02:33:06,1,8,AvailableProgram667,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/14aicet/who_knows_about_the_tesla_battery_and_motor/,True,0.67,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,
comment,14aicet,14aicet,,"this absolutely is possible.

But i don't know why you'd do this to a roadster. what you're essentially trying to do is EV convert a car that happens to already be an EV.

There's nothing about the roadster that makes it easier to swap in a model 3 powertrain. In  fact, i'd argue choosing the roadster is actually far more difficult due to the space/chassis constraints of it being such a small vehicle. it would be easier to put the model 3 powertrain into a gas vehicle because you'd be starting from scratch with an easier canvas.

there's companies that make custom replacement batteries specifically for the roadster. energy density has improved, so you can get better range now.

as far as this being frowned upon, there aren't many roadsters out there. they're somewhat collectible now.

Only reason to do this is if you think it's cool to specifically have a supercharging roadster. Some people might be confused (because normally roadsters do not supercharge). So this could be a popular conversion.

post,14f409m,,Tesla stock hit 8-month high Friday; Cathie Wood sold and made millions,"Cathie Wood and her Ark Invest firm cashed in a portion of their Tesla (TSLA) stock holdings Friday with the EV giant hitting eight-month highs and up around 28% in June. Meanwhile, Tesla is ramping up end-of-quarter vehicle delivery incentives.

Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management sold 73,113 shares of Tesla Friday for around $19.05 million, based on TSLA's closing price of 260.54. Friday's Tesla sell-off was done through ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW).  
  
Tesla stock recorded two tiny losses and ended a record 13-day win streak last week. However, on Friday shares rose to a fresh eight-month high. Ahead of Tuesday's trade, TSLA was up more than 70% over the past seven weeks, but still short — down around 17% — of September highs.  
  
Cathie Wood has been buying up Tesla on the cheap throughout 2023 before selling big in recent days.

On June 12, Wood sold off more than 393,000 shares of Tesla for around $98.2 million, based on TSLA's closing price of 249.83. Cathie Wood's funds purchased more than 1.3 million TSLA shares so far in 2023 and have now sold around 730,000 shares.

Tesla stock jumped 5.3% to 274.31 Tuesday during market trade.

# Final Push For Vehicle Deliveries

Tesla increased discounts on U.S. inventory Model S and Model X vehicles by $2,500 late Friday. Consumers can now get $7,500 off the luxury models after the EV company originally implemented a $5,000 price cut a few weeks ago.  
  
Meanwhile, days after Tesla increased U.S. Model Y all-wheel drive prices by $250, the company now offers discounts of around $500 on some inventory vehicles.  
  
Tesla also appears to be trying to move Model 3 inventory. Last week, the automaker began offering customers who order a Model 3 between June 14 and June 30 three months of unlimited free supercharging, according to the company's website.

post,14uirtn,,Potentially controversial car opinions thread,"I have a few controversial thoughts about cars and the current landscape of the car market that I want to share. Some of these are more controversial than others. Feel free to respond or share your own thoughts too.

&#x200B;

1. LUCID never intended to be a successful car company, but rather they intended to be an engineering firm and their cars are just being used to showcase their technology and gain publicity.   
The Air came out as a large luxury sedan. That is the most overcrowded EV segment, but it shows that LUCID is prioritizing its engineering over all else. Ever decision about the car was made from an engineering standpoint. The body is an ugly sedan, because that's the most aerodynamic shape. Its a luxury car to help hide the expensive costs of the battery and other electric drive train components. All of the drive-train components are some of, if not the best components in any electric vehicle. There are videos on youtube that LUCID posts that go into extensive details of why they are so efficient. LUCID has one single video on design posted. Its under a minute long and basically says that it was designed by the engineering team for efficiency.  
We're already seeing them begin to do engineering work for other companies like Aston Martin and this trend will only continue to grow.
2. Several traditional car companies are pricing themselves out of relevancy and leaving a huge gap in the market for startups and Chinese car companies to come in and take over. People can't buy exactly what they want. They have to select from the choices that they're given. As most car companies have raised their prices significantly in the last couple of years, consumers generally still have to pick from any of the now expensive cars. There is now a huge hole in the lower end of the new car marketplace for someone to come in and make a killing with a half-decent offering.",5035,True,1688858848.0,2023-07-09 01:27:28,757,1290,Jimmaayy,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/14uirtn/potentially_controversial_car_opinions_thread/,True,0.87,2023,both,search,False,False,0,
comment,14uirtn,14uirtn,,">5. Beige headliners cheap and don't belong in any cars. Headliners should match the interior of the car and no car should have a beige interior. Just put the extra coloring in and make it tan or go with something else like black.

Manufacturers intentionally make headliners beige in most economy cars and crossovers because it makes them look *significantly* bigger inside and also why a lot of premium sports coupes (my C8 for instance) have black linings becsuse it accentuates that cockpit feel. Selling point for crossovers is the idea of size but economical and a sports car you'd want to relate to a performance machine/fighter jet and that feeling of confinement is synonymous with excitement and speed/rigidity. One of the most cost-effective marketing ploys in the automotive market. 

Using an example, get in a new volvo with the ""bright package"" and the ""dark package"" and they feel SO different. Kind of mind blowing, actually. 

>9. The only thing special about new Alfas is that they're not that common.

I'm going to respectfully disagree with this vehemently. Back in 2020, I drove an Alfa Romeo Guilia Quadrifoligo for funsies with very little knolwedge of them other than theyre Italian and I love Ferraris and pasta.

Cybertrucks are going to be ramped up super fast and are expected to sell 60,000 units this year and more than 100,000 next year. Thanks to the single shot casting method which all these legacy autos like Ford, GM , BMW can not even think about, let alone designing it 

Cybertrucks will revolutionize and disrupt trucks and will probably eat F150s lunch just like how Model 3 and Y revolutionized Sedans and SUVs. They already has a record smashing quarter, setting a record for highest deliveries ever.  Tesla earnings Wednesday after hrs. Implied move about -/+ 7%.

post,15b4qg7,,Source: Tesla rigged the dashboard to overstate battery range; created a “Diversion Team” to suppress thousands of complaints,"In March, Alexandre Ponsin set out on a family road trip from Colorado to California in his newly purchased Tesla, a used 2021 Model 3. He expected to get something close to the electric sport sedan’s advertised driving range: 353 miles on a fully charged battery.

He soon realized he was sometimes getting less than half that much range, particularly in cold weather – such severe underperformance that he was convinced the car had a serious defect.

“We’re looking at the range, and you literally see the number decrease in front of your eyes,” he said of his dashboard range meter.

Ponsin contacted Tesla and booked a service appointment in California. He later received two text messages, telling him that “remote diagnostics” had determined his battery was fine, and then: “We would like to cancel your visit.”

What Ponsin didn’t know was that Tesla employees had been instructed to thwart any customers complaining about poor driving range from bringing their vehicles in for service. Last summer, the company quietly created a “Diversion Team” in Las Vegas to cancel as many range-related appointments as possible.

The Austin, Texas-based electric carmaker deployed the team because its service centers were inundated with appointments from owners who had expected better performance based on the company’s advertised estimates and the projections displayed by the in-dash range meters of the cars themselves, according to several people familiar with the matter.

A little over 10 years has passed since the [first deliveries of the Model S](https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-motors-begin-customer-deliveries-model-s-june-22nd), and without getting into the politics/psychology of the CEO or the enthusiast relevance of their cars, the company itself seems like it's entering a period of stability (uh, relatively speaking). They continue to deliver cars in volume, and [it looks like that volume is increasing.](https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/tesla-us-sales-figures/#:~:text=TESLA%20ANNUAL%20SALES%20AND%20MARKET%20SHARE) According to their [latest quarterly report,](https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/TSLA-Q2-2023-Update.pdf) their other business ventures are at least not a major source of drag on their financials, and unlike earlier years, [starting in 2021](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594778/tesla-q2-2021-earnings-revenue-profit-credits-emissions-bitcoin) Tesla isn't (at least part of the time) relying on resale of energy credits to be profitable. In short, they're making more cars and the company is probably actually profitable.

They have introduced desirable new products since 2017 (Model 3 and Model Y), and continue to be seen -- at least by investors and competitors -- as a market leader in North America in the EV space. And while they face [increasing competition abroad](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-electric-vehicle-market-share/) from Chinese brands and traditional automakers, they remain a powerful force outside North America too, which certainly seems to indicate that Tesla's products are desirable as well.

-----------------

**Sales**

Last time I lowered my bear case for 2023 to 1.7M, with 2.15M sales expected and 2.4M in the bull case. With 889K cars sold in H1 and the announced retooling for the Model 3 refresh, I expect them to comfortably exceed my bear case, but believe the bull case needs to lowered to 2.2M for an expected amount of sales of 1.95M for the full year. With the slightly slower ramp in Texas and Berlin, the slower than expected rollout of the Cybertruck and Mexico only coming online by the end of 2024 at the earliest, I will also lower the bull cases for 2024 and 2025 from 3.4M and 4.8M respectively:

||Bear Case|Bull Case|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**2023**|1,800,000|2,200,000|
|**2024**|2,400,000|3,000,000|
|**2025**|3,000,000|4,400,000|

**ASP**

I expected Tesla to decrease ASPs from $54,385 to ~$51K in 2023. With ASPs of $46,379 in H1, and although I expect ASPs to be higher in H2, I will also lower my expectations here to $47K.

I then expect ASPs to increase to $49K in 2024 and then start to decline with the introduction of the compact car, starting with $48K in 2025.",4023,True,1691147399.0,2023-08-04 13:09:59,17,15,Ehralur,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15hx56g/on_teslas_valuation_part_5/,True,0.7,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,15kvith,,The Real Issue With EVs Is That They're Just Not Big Enough For Americans,"Following up from my post here yesterday, I found [more information](https://jalopnik.com/the-real-issue-with-evs-is-that-theyre-just-not-big-eno-1850669545) supporting that one of the main reasons EV adoption isn't happening faster is because they're too small. I continue to firmly believe that you can't ask consumers to give up functionality of their existing vehicles — namely SUVs and trucks — to go electric. I understand that there are feeling about how we got into this situation to begin with and that a lot of people in this sub believe that vehicles are too large and should be made smaller. I agree with that in part, but we also need to be realistic about our present environment and acknowledge where consumers are at today.

I know that many people believe the government should step in and limit vehicle size, but I don't believe that's a winning strategy to drive EV adoption. I personally think that consumers need more choice and that means bigger vehicles. Here are some key points from the article above:

>“For a lot of people, that third row is the No. 1 reason for purchase,” says Jess Bala, director of global product planning at General Motors’ Cadillac brand, which is scheduled to reveal an electric Escalade IQ large SUV in August. “Those are often younger buyers who already are more interested in EVs.”  
>  
>Of course, it stands to reason that EVs expanding into new categories have an opportunity to reach new demographics that they haven’t been able to yet, like women and families. We’re still in the early adopter era, after all. That said, it’s not like there aren’t a wealth of midsize-plus electric SUVs out there.

post,15n1sl5,,My EQS sedan long term review,"So I leased an EQS 450+ sedan 4 months ago and wanted to give my thoughts in a brief long term use review. I'll break it down by category. 

Styling: Probably the biggest criticism you see about the EQS. Obviously this is subjective.  Personally I like it. I think it looks odd in pictures, but due to its size and stateliness looks better in person. It has a heft, stance, and weight that most sedans and other cars lack in an era where everything is a CUV. It is also fitting of an S class equivalent. That said, there's no denying it doesn't have the sex appeal or head turning nature of a Taycan, E-tron GT, or other 100k plus cars. 

Interior: I LOVE this cars interior. Great materials, good design, extremely comfortable seats. It has all the goodies like the massaging seats and what not. The UI is great and responsive. Voice controls work well. Built in navigation is excellent. I don't think I can ever buy a car without a HUD now. It is that awesome. This really separates this car from a Tesla, which feels cheap by comparison. On the downsides: wireless CarPlay is sometimes finicky or doesn't connect. The wireless charging spot is also finicky and sometimes doesn't charge. 

Handling and Ride quality: Another huge plus: It handles amazingly at low speed due to the rear wheel steering. You have to try it to believe it. It's a beast of a car but whips around low speed turns around the city like my old mazda2. At highway speeds it is super stable and comfortable. The air suspension is amazing. It is the quietest car at highway speeds I've ever seen. No road or wind noise. FWIW I've driven an EQE 350 SUV as well which has much more wind noise and body roll, unsurprisingly given the shape. On windy roads it is super planted and confident with no body roll, very poised. Of course it is an S class. It doesn't feel like a sports car and you don't feel the road like a model 3, but also much more comfortable. 

Performance: Another knock on this car is it's slow for the price.",4158,True,1691641130.0,2023-08-10 06:18:50,163,101,toado3,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/15n1sl5/my_eqs_sedan_long_term_review/,True,0.96,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,15otjua,,Why not build more low-tech EVs?,"Manufacturers of electric cars always seem to be catering to futuristic rich techy crowd whenever a new one is announced, and it always makes me wonder why. If anyone were to design and sell an EV without all the bells and whistles of a Tesla or a Rivian, I would buy one immediately. 

I drive a 2008 Scion xB and I feel right at home and I only wish it could run on electricity. Great range, spacious interior, decent sound, fun to drive but not for showing off, and it all works great. All the other stuff I can live without, and I feel so many would think the same. 

It feels like smarter call for business to invest in lower end models like this too. You'd get a lot more average customers who can afford a lower price and will buy more of them than the smaller number of more well-off folk buying them. The adoption rate would be up, and demand for better ones overtime will add up for more profits.

* Cars are expensive.  No like REALLY expensive.  Just to put the most basic new car on the road you could possible think of is expensive.  It could easily cost the manufacture $80k/car but read on before you call BS.
* To get this stupid expensive thing cheap you have to sell a lot of them.  So much of the cost is the $2B+ designing, testing and setting up production.  Sell 1m/year and now the same car has a $15k/car cost.
* Funny thing is, when you draw out the venn diagram of new car buyers and those buyers that want a brutally basic car, you don't get enough people so you're back to $80k/car in cost as you can't get the volume you need.  There is no great yearning masses for basic new cars outside the fleet industry.
* Then you realize that adding most features is cheap.  Those ventilated seats you charge $1500 for is just a piece of plastic, a fan and a flex hose to the AC tunnel in the center console.  If you're running power to the seat now, make the seat move with motors for $15 more.  If it moves, add profiles so they move to set positions for each driver.  It goes on.
* When you look at sales, features sell.

**Powertrain - Performance**: First of all, this car is *a lot* slower than my Model 3. Now with that out of the way, just how slow is the slowest EV BMW sells at the moment? The answer is it's actually quite decent. BMW's official numbers are 282hp/295lb-ft/5.8s 0-60. In typical BMW fashion I suspect all those numbers are generously underrated and the car feels properly fast at speed up to 50mph. Launching at 0mph actually doesn't feel as fast as stomping the throttle at 30mph (which is fast enough to scare unsuspected passengers). My guess is it's related to RWD/traction control.

I’ve driven 2022 Model 3s with EAPs and they are truly much worse than my 2018 Model 3 due to the removal of radar. Phantom braking was almost daily and during that 2 weeks of rental I stopped using it whenever there is a passenger in my car.

Truth be told, I have zero faith for Tesla’s “future promises” in terms of anything driver assist related. The same kind of lofty promises for HW4 came and went for HW3 and HW2, and at the end of the day my friend’s 2016 Model S 90D with the MobileEye solution has more reliable highway assist than the aforementioned 2022 Model 3.",838,False,1692013021.0,2023-08-14 13:37:01,26,0,cookingboy,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/15qreqy/my_2_weeks_ownership_review_of_the_bmw_i4_edrive35/jw4knpb/,True,,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,jw4knpb

post,15v0evh,,Friendly reminder that a person’s EV road trip experience can vary wildly depending on the region they live.,"I see some variation of this conversation over and over online. One person will say something like “EVs are inconvenient to me. I have to stop longer and more often than usual. It turned my typical 7 hour road trip into a 9 hour trip!” And another person will respond with something like “I just did a 7 hour road trip and the EV didn’t add ANY time. By the time I use the restroom and grab something to eat, the car is ready to go!” But here’s the rub, they BOTH can be right, even if they’re talking about the same car. The impact that an EV has on your road trip experience can vary wildly depending on where you’re travelling. Let’s take a look at two scenarios.

&#x200B;

Person A is taking a round trip in a Model Y LR from his home in the Norfolk, VA area up to the New York, NY area. Because of the traffic and speed limits, the 360 mile trip takes 6.5 hours both ways. The place he’ll be staying has a Level 2 charger where he can charge overnight. According to ABRP, he can do the entire trip with just one \~30 minute stop on the way there and one \~30 minute stop on the way back. He normally makes a 30 minute stop to eat lunch when using his gas car anyway, so the Model Y doesn’t add any time to his trip. His typical 14 hour round trip still takes 14 hours. 

&#x200B;

Person B is also taking a round trip in a Model Y LR from his home in the San Antonio, TX area out to El Paso, TX area. Since he can comfortably drive 85 mph for the entire 550 mile trip, it usually takes him around 7 hours each way including stops, meaning his typical round trip is also 14 hours. (Note: This is another area that causes confusion with people in different regions. The speed limit during most of the drive is 80 mph with a few areas at 75 mph. 85 mph is the actual flow of traffic and not some dangerously high speed that you may be picturing if you’re used to 65 mph highways.) The place he’ll be staying does not have EV charging, so he’ll be relying on Superchargers for all his juice.",4868,True,1692402669.0,2023-08-19 01:51:09,106,60,JohnDeaux2k,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/15v0evh/friendly_reminder_that_a_persons_ev_road_trip/,True,0.78,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,15wfye5,,Callable CDs and YTC and YTW,"I am looking at callable CDs and I cannot figure out what YTC and YTW mean. Here is an example of what I am looking at for a two year CD (actual numbers captured from brokerage account):

>Maturity Date 09/02/2025  
>  
>Coupon Rate 5.500%  
>  
>Coupon Type Fixed  
>  
>Coupon Frequency Semi-annually

>Accrual Day Count Act/365  
>  
>Dated Date 08/30/2023

>First Settlement Date 08/30/2023  
>  
>First Coupon Date 02/29/2024  
>  
>Price -- 100.000

>Current Yield -- 5.500%

>Annual Percentage Yield (APY) -- 5.500%

>  
>Available Quantity 0 2165  
>  
>Trade Min/Increment 0 / 0 1 / 1  
>  
>Min/Increment 0 / 0 1 / 1

I assume this CD is callable at any time over the 2 year maturity period.

What I thought YTW meant was the minimum yield I would receive if the CD called before maturity. I would have expected that to be less then the coupon rate itself, so I must be misunderstanding what all of this means.

Does this all mean that I just receive the coupon rate up until the date of being called with interest accumulation ending at the call date? (Which I thought was just YTC).

investopedia: ""Yield to worst is a measure of the lowest possible yield that can be received on a bond that fully operates within the terms of its contract without defaulting.""

and

""If a bond is callable, it becomes important to look at the YTW. The yield to maturity will always be higher than the YTW (YTC) because the investor earns more when they hold the bond for its full maturity. The YTW is important though because it provides deeper due diligence on a bond with a call provision. The shorter time frame a bond is held for, the less the investor earns. YTW provides a clear calculation of this potential scenario showing the lowest yield possible.""

So, in my example above, YTM, YTC, and YTW are all the same. That doesn't make sense to me.

Can someone explain this to me?  Thank you!",1977,False,1692549164.0,2023-08-20 18:32:44,2,10,Slight-Studio-7667,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15wfye5/callable_cds_and_ytc_and_ytw/,True,0.6,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,15xs05u,,TESLA will Cyber Truck sell well and move share price to a new all time high?,"Have to be honest with you I don’t currently have a position in Tesla. But I am intrigued about what I’m hearing regarding the release of the cyber truck. Evidently they have a lot of orders currently with big deposits, along with a backlog of 1,900,000 orders waiting to be filled with a late 2023 or early 2024 release date.  
According to this article, that is a five-year backlog.  

“Tesla Cybertruck Orders Surpass 1.9 Million, 5 Year Wait Times” 

There are now over 1.9 million orders for the long-awaited Tesla Cybertruck, per a crowd-sourced data tracker. Speaking on an Earnings Call earlier this week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated that demand for the Cybertruck is ""so off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.”

Given that Tesla plans to produce 375,000 Cybertrucks a year at peak capacity, new orders will technically take around 5 years to arrive. 

It seems to me that Tesla would be a great place to jump in if it falls to $200 per share.  I don’t see it going much lower than $200.00 

Recent history:
52 week history $101.81 low and $313.00 high.

""With today’s moves. Volkswagen stock, less the share of Porsche it owns, is worth almost nothing–about $1 billion. Porsche has a market capitalization of roughly $91 billion. VW owns about 80% of that stock, or almost $73 billion. And Volkswagen’s entire market capitalization is about $74 billion.(Adjusted for debt makes things look worse, it makes VW as an entity worth less than zero.)That value is despite estimates that VW operating profit in 2022, excluding all of Porsche’s earnings, should come to $13 billion or $14 billion.A company trading for 0.07 times 2022 operating profit ($1 billion divided by $13.5 billion) is hard to reconcile.

The Volkswagen Group sells passenger cars under the Audi, Bentley, Cupra, Jetta, Lamborghini, Porsche, SEAT, Škoda and Volkswagen brands, motorcycles under the Ducati name, light commercial vehicles under the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brand, and heavy commercial vehicles via the marques of the listed subsidiary Traton (Navistar, MAN, Scania and Volkswagen Truck & Bus). It is divided into two primary divisions: the Automotive Division and the Financial Services Division. As of 2008, it had about 342 subsidiary companies.\[10\] Volkswagen also has three joint ventures in China, FAW-Volkswagen, SAIC Volkswagen and Volkswagen Anhui.

Volkswagen AG is trading at a discount to their said 75% stake in Porsche AG. 

So basically in buying VW at its current price, in terms of ownership you get all the remaining companies under Volkswagen's roof for free. That being said though, the aforementioned Porsche SE is also trading at about 60% of the value of their stake in Volkswagen AG, so in buying them, you theoretically get an even larger discount.

Historically, there has always been a 40 to 50 percent discount between Porsche SE and Volkswagen, mostly because their leadership is not particularly interested in serving minor shareholder interests and also because selling their stake would obviously massively tank the price.",937,False,1693244606.0,2023-08-28 19:43:26,18,0,Dense_Beach,investing,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/163mozx/volkswagen_extremely_undervalued/jy48p4t/,True,,2023,elon,search,False,False,0,jy48p4t
comment,163mozx,163mozx,,"VW is still insanely profitable. They have a strong brand, solid finances and the ever-lasting support of the German government for being one of the largest employers and tax payers in the country.

So why the low valuation? Basically, the market doesn't much care about the current profits, large as they may be. It cares about future profits and seems to be pessimistic about that.

They sell mostly cars with internal combustion engines. The growth of their EV portfolio is disappointing and feels way too slow considering fast moving competition like Tesla and - arguably more important - Chinese brands.

China has been and still is VW's most important market. But China has developed it's own car industry and in the EV space, its own brands are starting to produce cars that can compete in terms of both price and quality.

This year and for the first time BYD, a Chinese car maker, sold more of its own cars in China than VW. That likely won't be a singular event but rather marks the start of a lasting trend.

I started a VW position in 2016 and am still holding. The dividend yield is nice but I'm starting to have doubts about the future. I would like to see them cut the dividend and use the money to drastically accelerate the EV transition. That will probably not happen as most shareholders would be against it.

My immediate reactions are the obvious ones: Why replace such a new car? Why replace a truck with a SUV?

But putting those aside, to address your specific topics:

* IMO, ride quality of the Model X is good, but not as smooth as a high-end luxury vehicle. I keep mine in Sport/Plaid configuration for everything, but frankly the ""comfort"" mode doesn't seem that much different.
* Noise level on the highway seems good, but not as quiet as some other vehicles I've driven. For both ride quality and noise level, the short answer is: better than the Tesla 3 and Y, but not as refined as, say a Mercedes.
* I personally strongly prefer the Tesla nav and UI over CarPlay. While I find CarPlay a life-saving crutch when dealing with inferior infotainment systems from the likes of Stallantis or Toyota, it's really just ""acceptable"" where most OEM software is ""completely unacceptable."" CarPlay is slow (even when wired and on a fast phone, it's the timing of animations, not the smoothness), cartoony, and has pretty bad UX design overall.
* Seat comfort is great, IMO. Nice side bolstering and synthetic seat material.
* Cabin size is good. Plenty of room inside.
* I use FSD Beta, so I can't comment on Enhanced Autopilot.
* Other stuff: The performance is thoroughly insane and fun; it never gets old.

post,16bnu6p,,"Explaining the CyberTruck’s Depressing Inspiration: As Rivian instills a sense of adventure, the CyberTruck wants to romanticize survival in a fictional cyberpunk dystopia","So, listen… I’m really not impressed with the CyberTruck overall. I think it’s really ugly, impractical, and sort of, well, dumb. While we don’t know many details about the production model, it will most likely be capable — even if there’s a lot wrong with its functionality (most egregiously its sloped bed walls). But what I can’t stop thinking about is what CyberTrucks stand for.

I can’t imagine how people are going to react to these on the road. The design is so divisive and like nothing we’ve seen since the ill-fated DeLorean. That design is so important to Elon Musk it delayed the launch of the truck because it had to be built out of stainless steel to achieve its design goals. This required new production methods never before seen and whole bunch of considerations. I’m starting with this because it shows that the design of the CT is more important than just about anything else. I firmly believe Tesla could have made an equally capable truck a hell of a lot faster by using traditional materials. But they didn’t. They couldn’t. The design language of the CT is what makes it so special to Elon.

I’m genuinely shocked that Tesla let (now-legitimate) rival Rivian take such a massive first mover advantage to achieve its design which is credited for long production delays. Rivian has tens of thousands of trucks on the road today an is targeting a total of 52k produced this year. Rivian is cornering the “capable EV truck” market more every quarter. Just today I was walking to my R1T when I heard a family say, “Oh wow, another Rivian. There are lots of those everywhere now.” We’ll come back to comparing Rivian and Tesla again later in this post, but it’s no secret that CyberTruck’s success depends on enough people buying it that passersbys start to say the same thing. Time will tell if that happens, but, if it does, I’m pretty bummed out based on what the CyberTruck’s represents and its inspirations.

So, what inspired such an… ugly truck?

post,16fi3qv,,"After two years of waiting, I got my Z06. Here are my initial thoughts.","Tl;dr - I love it. **If it had a different interior, you'd swear while driving that it was made by an exotic manufacturer.** It is an improvement over the Stingray in every way and it's my favorite car that I've ever driven.

-----

Apologies in advance. I usually don't review things too much, but seeing as the Z06 is still relatively new, I figured I'd share some early thoughts. I've only got about 200 miles on it so far, so still in the engine break in period.

After putting down my deposit about two years ago and getting lucky to receive an ""early"" allocation at one of the big Corvette dealers, I finally received my Z06 a couple days ago.

You can probably already tell by my flair, but I also currently own a C8 Stingray. I've also recently (last two years or so) owned a 981 Cayman GTS, a Tesla Model 3, and a Mercedes C43 AMG. Also in the last couple years, I've been able to have quite a bit of seat time, either through rentals or friends, in an AMG GT, Huracan, 458, R8, Supra, and DB11. All that context to say that I like driving in general and there isn't one particular experience that I look for. I can enjoy small sports cars, luxury cars, old JDM cars, and whatever else.

---

***First impressions***

**The looks**

I mean, it's basically the same as the Stingray except for...

* It's a bit wider
* It has an updated front fascia
* The side boomerang is now a wishbone
* The exhaust is in the center of the rear rather than the corners

At this point, people have largely developed their own opinions on how the car looks. It isn't for everyone (with some people getting weirdly aggressive about how much they don't like it), but I really enjoy it. The Z06's changes give it better proportions, IMO, and fix some of the issues with the rear end on the Stingray.

**The interior**

...is the same as the Stingray. However, the cabin is much louder.

We have a HYSA at 25k. Should we add ti that so we have more liquid miney.

Or, should we be putting more in our traditional investment account?

post,16k890q,,WSJ - Detroit automakers entered labor talks at cost disadvantage to Tesla,"Tickers mentioned: GM, F, STLA, TSLA

* Meeting UAW's initial demand would increase total average hourly compensation from $66 to $136 an hour vs. $45 at Tesla, according to Wells Fargo.  They are asking for a 32-hour work week but annualized on a 40-hour week that would be approximately $283,000 in total compensation.
* It would further widen Tesla's tremendous advantage in efficiency as legacy automakers try to steer a costly transition to a future away from carbon emitting gas vehicles.
* A key difference in compensation is TSLA employees tend to get cheap options that can increase a lot in value if the stock moves up.
* “This is our generation’s defining moment,” Fain said late Thursday before the walkout. “The money is there. The cause is righteous.”
* “Competition is code word for race to the bottom, and I’m not concerned about Elon Musk building more rocket ships so he can fly in outer space and stuff,” Fain told CNBC on-air Wednesday.

More than a day into the United Auto Workers strike against the Detroit automakers and one thing is clear: Elon Musk has already won.

And the billionaire tycoon isn’t even involved. 

Musk won before the strike began early Friday. He won before negotiations started two months ago. From the get-go, General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis were expected to spend more on wages because of the union’s pressure. The question is just how much of an increase, and so far their offers haven’t pleased the union, igniting this past week’s work stoppage.

**Whatever happens, more money surely will be spent.

post,16obp0z,,Proper built-in charger routing while navigating,"Hello all,

I'm doing research for my next company which has to be an EV due to new policies in my country.

I don't necessarily have range anxiety as I know cars charge fast enough and chargers are popping up all over the place.

However, one point that is important for me is a proper built-in charger routing while I'm navigating to my destination.

I'm using Tesla as a benchmark here:  
\* Built-in navigation system routes you via Superchargers if you need to charge  
\* Shows you how many chargers are in use, etc.  
\* Has up to date information (as far as I'm aware) so that it shows latest chargers  
\* The car is preconditioning the battery when it knows it will arrive at a Supercharger within x minutes.  
\* Shows new roads quite early on. The same way Google Maps or Apple Maps work, so offers free navigation updates.

\--> Due to this, a separate app on your phone like ABRP is not necessary; also not after 1 year of use when other cars' navigation maps are outdated.

Note: the Tesla Model Y is just within my budget, so any cars that are significantly more expensive I don't want to include.  


As I'm living in Europe, most EV's have a CCS connector, so the car is not limited only to non-Superchargers or vise versa.

I'm also aware that Google Maps and now also Apple Maps can show current status at chargers, but cars are not preconditioning when using these apps.

Could someone advice me which other EV's offer the same or similar EV routing function?  
I just don't want to limit myself to a Tesla. I prefer them, but I don't want to regret it later on when it appears other vehicles are doing a better job.

The car build-in navigation also select the best FCs when using route planning. And shows the availability. This includes also all the AC chargers.
It displays all non-Tesla chargers.

I used the free ABRP when i got my car 2 years ago. But stopped after 4-5 months. No added value.

In practice, i only need FC when i drive more than 425 km (winter 375 km) in one freeway stretch. I mostly charge with AC chargers. I sometimes drive 600+ km a day for work, with only AC charge stop(s) in between. Works well.

Rule of thumb i use is: 1 hour freeway drive, 2 hrs AC (11 kW) charging. When there are AC chargers, and you stay long enough at a place, you charge enough as well. In theory, i could live like 425 km from work. Drive to it, charge at work, make a workday, and drive 425 km back. Making 850 km a day without using a fast charger.

post,16uiioh,,How Much Is Tesla Worth? You Decide,"Wall Street Journal out with an article that lets you plug in 5 simple variables to get a valuation for Tesla.

The 5 variables are: how many cars Tesla sells in 2030, average selling price of a Tesla car in 2030 in today’s dollars, operating margin, cost of capital, and how much Tesla’s other operations are worth.

The Wall Street Journal has 4 pre-set scenarios:

1. Bearish - $58.5 billion valuation based on 5 million cars at $30k with 8% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $0 valuation for other operations besides cars

2. Default - $381 billion valuation based on 7 million cars at $30k with 10% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $200 billion valuation for other operations.

3. Bullish - $770 billion valuation based on 10 million cars at $30k with 12% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, $400 billion for other operations

4. Superfan - $2.33 trillion valuation based on 20 million cars at $30k with 15% operating margin, 8% cost of capital, $600 billion for other operations

Their assumptions are as follows:

> Our model is based on estimates of Tesla’s future cash flows. It multiplies anticipated vehicle sales in 2030 by the average anticipated price to calculate revenue, and then applies the expected operating margin to arrive at operating profit. Estimates for the years before 2030 assume a smooth path in the variables from this year’s FactSet analyst consensus.

> Operating profit is taxed at an 11% rate (FactSet consensus for Tesla in 2023). Cash flows are then calculated as posttax operating profit minus capital expenditures while adding back depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures are assumed to be a flat 7% of revenue and depreciation and amortization 20% of capital expenditures.

> Estimated cash flows through 2030 are discounted back to their present value at the discount rate and aggregated. A terminal value is added to account for Tesla’s cash flows beyond 2030, assuming a steady-state growth rate of 5%.",2699,True,1695913674.0,2023-09-28 17:07:54,0,36,32no,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/16uiioh/how_much_is_tesla_worth_you_decide/,True,0.47,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,16wzsc4,,EV Price Premium Tracker (US market) - Q3 2023 update,"After the good reception to this spreadsheet / doc last month, and because I also could use a new hobby, I have decided to continue developing the **EV Price Premium Tracker**, with updates at the end of every quarter!

# [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUxEk20Km1knnKLqeJtzifyN3f8Nghu9H1Qqra6EAR3fXiUlXTPe57WIggcwC3wYRgs4np4G020Dra/pubhtml](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUxEk20Km1knnKLqeJtzifyN3f8Nghu9H1Qqra6EAR3fXiUlXTPe57WIggcwC3wYRgs4np4G020Dra/pubhtml)

The **EV Price Premium Tracker**, formerly the ""EV Price Parity Scorecard"", is an ongoing spreadsheet that shows the differences in MSRP between EVs and ICE vehicles in the same segment, from the same brand, configured to as close to feature parity as possible.

New for the Q3 2023 update are sheets comparing the EV pricing of ""modern OEMs"" such as Tesla, Rivian, and Fisker, with ICE models from both mainstream and premium segments. In addition, for all sheets, I have identified which model year's pricing / configuration is being compared. Finally, I have added info for many single-motor RWD model variants, as that was lacking before.

\--

At the current stage of the EV transition, there are three categories of ""class parity"" among vehicles from the same brand:

* EVs that are directly based off of existing ICE models (or the other way around). This includes the Volvo XC40 Recharge and the BMW i4.
* EVs that are their own models / platforms compared to ICEs, but that share the same naming structure and market positioning. This includes the Mercedes EQS SUV versus the GLS, the Audi Q8 e-Tron versus the Q8, and the Chevrolet Blazer EV versus the Blazer ICE.
* EVs that have no direct equivalent but can be matched with an equivalent ICE in the brand based on the body style, available features, and exterior and / or interior dimensions. Think a Nissan Ariya versus a Rogue (X-Trail), a Volkswagen ID.4 versus a Tiguan (LWB), an Audi e-Tron GT versus an A7, and the like.",3153,True,1696163060.0,2023-10-01 14:24:20,38,14,lostinheadguy,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16wzsc4/ev_price_premium_tracker_us_market_q3_2023_update/,True,0.96,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,16zxqmv,,Modern cars(EV's in particular) are heading in the wrong direction,"Probably obvious to many of you as well, but it really hit me when I started car shopping recently and revisited some cars I'd be been interested in such as the F150 lightning and Mercedes EQS SUV.

1.**Subscriptions.** Many of us have griped about it, but I was blown away by how many things Mercedes wanted to charge for, even extra \*degrees\* of tire turning. It's absolutely insane and immediately soured me on the EQS SUV. Ford is charging $2500 for BlueCruise...ongoing, which is nuts. Yes they have to map things and pay their employees, but $2500 ongoing?

2.**Size.** The F150 I can kind of forgive as it's pretty much the same as most modern trucks and they're all getting bigger and more annoyingly, \*taller\*; which is very harrowing for someone that currently drives a sedan. I am either being blinded by their lights, or tailgated and the height of the trucks really driving up my stress levels. Especially when some of these people are on their phones or just being dicks. Ironically this is part of the reason that I've been eyeing either an SUV or a truck for my next vehicle, because I just do not feel comfortable driving around these monstrosities, especially the ones jacked up to heaven.

3.**Pricing.** This is more about the EV's. I get it, mostly newer tech, yada, yada. But it's been a while now since EV's have been sold to the masses and while the cost to run may be very enticing, the cost to purchase is not. A lot of the discounts or government grants are very specific, there's new taxes implemented as well and there's really not much around 35k that seems worth it if you have or want a family, or even just like traveling a lot. I would be fine(would even prefer) a midsize SUV or hatchback even that seats 5-6 adults/teens, has ample room, good range and doesn't cost over 35k. No such vehicle exists.

>Yes they have to map things and pay their employees, but $2500 ongoing?

no. $2100 for 3 years.

after that it's 66/month if you buy a year at a time.

BlueCruise activation for Ford customers costs $2,100 for three years at time of order or vehicle purchase. If a customer chooses not to activate upfront, after their complimentary trial they can choose an annual plan for $800 or a monthly plan for $75. If a customer chooses to forego activating BlueCruise, they can continue to experience Adaptive Cruise Control, which lets the driver set a cruising speed and distance from the vehicle ahead, including in stop-and-go traffic.

* Charging stations in navigation can now be filtered by charging capacity.

* LSS (Lane support system): number of warnings significantly reduced to the most necessary and legally necessary. Less vibrations on the handlebars.
* IHB (intelligent high beam): Should be more precise, turn off the lights earlier to avoid annoying oncoming traffic. Should be better on highways too.
* X-Pilot ACC (adaptive cruise control): should work more ""smoothly"", less braking by parked cars at the edge of the street. Also improved logic in processing speed limit changes. Now automatically maintains speed when switching from LCC to ACC by steering movement.
* X-Pilot LCC (Lane Centering Control): Traffic light detection has now been added and appears at the top of the driver's dashboard. Optimization of acceleration and braking, so less slow acceleration and less sudden braking, even when drivers merge in front of you into your lane. Also less delay in corners and less chance of the system switching itself off.
* ALC (automatic lane shift assistant): Feedback has been improved and timing of acceleration after the lane change has taken place has been improved. ALC should be able to be the primary means of lane changing on the highway.

post,1740hqd,,Tesla Cybertruck Off-road Capabilities,"I saw this video showing Cybertrucks going off-road on the Baja 1000 rally route. I don't know much about off-roading, but a quick search says that the Baja 1000 rally is one of the most prestigious off-road races in the world. It seems quite impressive for Tesla's first truck. As a side note and correct me if I'm wrong, if Cybertruck is used as a work truck for business, wouldn't a business owner be able to write it off 100% as an expense as long as it met a specific weight requirement?

post,174vjgo,,My thoughts as a Model Y Lessee > Lucid Air Pure Lessee,"I leased a Model Y Performance, fully loaded in Sept 2020.  I had some minor issues with it over time, but honestly it was one of the most exciting, fun and reliable vehicles I've ever driven. *No, I will not be discussing charging infrastructure here because I haven't yet roadtripped in the Air -- but the range, so far, in the Air seems REAL and ACCURATE, vs the MYP.*

--

My main complaints with the MYP were the EXTREMELY uncomfortably hard sport suspension and the increasingly hazardous support infrastructure at Tesla where getting in touch with a human and/or scheduling appointments was awful.  Also I'm not an Elon fan, but that wasn't a make-or-break.

In the run up to end of lease, I tried to buy a used 2021 Model S LR+, I wanted the luxury and increased range, and it felt like a safe bet cost-wise though it was probably higher than I wanted to put down with interest rates and all.  I paid money to ship it to the east coast from the west coast, plus a small deposit.  The week before delivery, Tesla dropped new vehicle prices for the S and X.  This absolutely torpedoed the value of the car I'd just spent money sending to the east coast.  Long story short, Tesla is VERY non-communicative and I ended up walking away from it.

In my search for another car, I stumbled across the latest round of lower lease prices being offered by Lucid on the Air Pure -- being in the northeast, I wanted AWD and all told it checked all the same boxes the Model S did but it was (1) new; (2) more beautiful; (3) longer range; (4) featured better quality materials.  After some negotiation, I came away paying less for it monthly than I did the MYP.

My experience with Lucid has been as follows:

1. Unlike Tesla, they are HUNGRY.  They are responsive, their team is on standby and will reply even by text message -- personally.  They are friendly and follow through and are thorough.

comment,17a0wc7,17a0wc7,,"From the article: Tesla has issued an over-the-air (OTA) recall affecting nearly 55,000 2021-2023 Tesla Model X vehicles over concerns the vehicle controller will not detect and warn the driver of low brake fluid levels. As is typical with most National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recalls and Tesla, the company has already fixed the issue through a free OTA software update.

According to the recall document posted to the NHTSA [website](https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2022/TESLA/MODEL%252520X#recalls), the issue was first discovered in several Model X vehicles in September 2023, where a visual indicator for low brake fluid was not functioning. The Brakes Integration team initiated an investigation between September 19 and September 27, during which they examined sensor data, performed tests to confirm the issue, and assessed design specifications to identify the root cause.

On September 27, the team determined that an incorrect setting in the vehicle controller’s threshold range was causing the problem. Just one day later, on September 28, Tesla initiated an OTA software update to correct the issue. Tesla says as of October 10, 2023, there have been no reported crashes, injuries, or deaths related to this issue.

The OTA update that corrected the issue was 2023.32.7 or later, a non FSD Beta branch. For affected Model X vehicles with FSD Beta, Tesla says a fix will be included in the next release, a date for which was not provided.",1471,False,1697556301.0,2023-10-17 17:25:01,26,0,chrisdh79,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/17a0wc7/20212023_tesla_model_x_gets_ota_recall_to_update/k59oy2z/,True,,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,k59oy2z

You can have a physical control center full of buttons with a minimalist design. Check out Critroen CX for example, with the two satellites on the sides of the single fucking arm steering wheel (just beautiful).

You can have a fully functional 'minimalist' design by reducing ornaments or a purely aesthetic design, but if you reduce functionalities at the same time as ergonomics IT IS ANOTHER THING.

I've been lurking here for a few weeks trying to learn. I have two sums of savings I want to invest.

The first is my cash savings. It is roughly around 18k and I need it to be semi-liquid. Something I could get in a week or so. I am thinking of moving this to a MM or HYSA. Any recommendations? 

The second is my employee stock program. I want to move this out of the market and into something more stable and consistent. I have around 10k here in long term and 15k in short term. This money is for a down-payment on a vehicle in the next few years and possibly other expenses if my savings dry up from above. Should I just group this into the MM/HYSA decision above? Or would something like a treasury bills ladder work well? 

I'm still learning and thankful for this community for its insights.

post,17hklip,,Real World EV Road Trip,"Rightfully so there is a lot of debate on how effective current EVs are in anything but around-town driving. 

I thought I’d share the results of my 1000+ mile road trip in an EV to paint a real world picture to contribute to the debate.  I’m trying to keep this only about the numbers ie cost and time of charging on the roads and let the reader make their own decisions.

The trip: from Louisville KY to Madison WI and back (total trip 1085 miles) for a wedding over a long wknd in a Tesla Model Y:

1.	⁠Left Thursday evening after work, drove to hotel (Hilton chain) on the north side of Indianapolis, 125 miles.  Used their free charger to recharge to 100% while I slept.

2.	⁠Woke up Friday, drove 219 miles to a Tesla Supercharger in Peru, IL at a Hy-Vee grocery store. Charged to 92% in 40 minutes while we ate lunch, got groceries for our weekend, picked out a card for the wedding, etc. Charging cost $26.52

3.	⁠Drove the remainder of the trip to wedding location Friday afternoon. 171 miles. Plugged into a regular 120V outlet at our Airbnb to charge while the car was parked. Drove to and from various things like rehearsal dinner, sight seeing, etc.

4.	⁠Woke up Sunday morning and left with a 70% charge. Drove 125 miles to Tesla Supercharger in Rochelle IL. Charged to 80% in 25 mins while taking bathroom break, snacks, etc.  Cost $20.52

5.	⁠Drove 161 miles to Tesla Supercharger in Urbana IL. Add 54% to the battery in 20 minutes, went to the bathroom, watched part of Netflix episode. Cost $16.34

6.	⁠Drove 130 miles to Indy Supercharger, ate lunch at Jimmy John’s while charging. 25 minutes. Cost $19.50.

7.	⁠Drove the remaining 112 miles home; arrive with 25% charge. Put the car on the charger at home.

Total charging cost: $82.88. If we would have drove my wife’s Toyota (averaging 32 MPG, avg gallon of gas in the region at the time $3.70) it would have cost $127.19 in gas.

So I made [**evtable.com**](https://evtable.com/all) where you can see:

* [Top recommended EVs](https://evtable.com/#topPicks=1) for different types of buyers (obviously Tesla Model Y as the general recommendation)
* [Latest EV news](https://evtable.com/news/), curated toward the substantive things like new cars being announced.

If you find [evtable.com](https://evtable.com) helpful:

* Think of the 1-2 people you know who are in the market for a new electric vehicle, and send them the site
* Subscribe to the email newsletter so you hear about major site and car updates (literally I've sent 1 of these in 3 months though, so trying to keep it to the good stuff)

post,17j4q1u,,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"\*\* I have no position that is impacted by this post\*\*

Over the past few years, TSLA has performed nothing short of extraordinary. In the last five years, Tesla stock has almost 10x its value. The 857% total return of Tesla is substantially higher than all of its peers, including Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen

Despite strong growth, weakness has begun to present itself within the Wall Street prince in the past year. Tesla announced earlier in February 2023 that it would be cutting prices on the Model Y. This move surprised investors because, before the price cuts, Tesla appeared to be entirely supply-side constrained. However, investors noted that these cuts only impacted higher-end models that were outside the range of the mass vehicle market. However, in April, Tesla announced that it would be cutting prices on the Model 3. Elon Musk has previously alluded to a poor performing EV market in the wake of a higher interest rate environment. Economic data confirms this narrative as Automobile shipments have declined substantially in Q3’ 2023.

However, two factors that cannot be explained by an adverse economic environment are Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Cybertruck demand. FSD is Tesla’s end-to-end autonomous driving solution.

Tesla’s FSD is considered a level 2 autonomous driving solution. Level 2 systems require the driver to remain alert at all times with the anticipation that driver will have to take over in every circumstance. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly claimed that FSD would be finished by the end of the year for the past six years. Additionally, Musk has claimed that robo-taxis, completely automated taxi services would be available during the same timeframes.

Longer-term investment worthiness won't really happen for me until they're closer to a p/e multiple of 10, because positive earnings in the next few years are suspect and I don't feel TSLA engenders the feeling of brand or performance record (for me) that a Google or VW offers.

comment,17mj9vb,17mj9vb,,"Not using LiDAR, when every other higher rated self-driving car does, is not smart.

Self driving is largely only possible with cameras/software for virtual AND physical sensors like LiDAR. Tesla removed RADAR even but that is more problematic than LiDAR, both are better than just computer vision for virtual object detection.

If they used LiDAR they could detect stationary objects. This would have been no problem for LiDAR 300+ yards out.

Computer vision will always be able to be fooled by 2d vision without physical 3d checks.

Tesla's don't have physical depth checking. They are trying to do everything with computer vision that is affected by weather, light, debris, dirt, and unknowns in their detection. It is why their lead AI guy left, it is an impossible feat without physical depth checking (LiDAR).

post,17osjlf,,Pics of Stealth Grey next to Midnight Silver,"I thought this might be useful for those that want a better idea as to what Stealth Grey looks like in person. I called my local dealer to see if they had any in stock and the guy on the phone told me to hurry over because they had one next to a grey Model 3. 

Some things I noticed: I see why they call it Stealth, because the color changes pretty drastically depending on the light and angle. Walking up to it I thought the guy was mistaken and that he was showing me a black Model X. Up close, it looks like a darker version of the existing Model 3 grey. 

I’m purchasing a Model S Plaid as they are letting me transfer over my unlimited supercharging (2018 Model S 75D) and I was torn between Black and Stealth Grey. After seeing it in person I opted for Stealth Grey! Delivery is Nov/Dec.

P.S. any tips on the best ways to sell used Model S’s would be appreciated.

post,17przt8,,Cathie Wood has a blunt warning about Tesla's stock over the coming months,"Ark Invest, a firm known for its bullish stance on Elon Musk and Tesla, believes that Tesla is well-positioned to dominate the self-driving cars and robotaxi fleet industry, which it anticipates could be worth up to $10 trillion by 2030. In April, Ark projected that Tesla's stock could reach $2,000 per share by 2027. Despite weak quarterly earnings and falling gross margins, Ark remains confident in Tesla's potential due to its focus on robotaxis.

However, Ark has been reducing its Tesla holdings in recent months, even as the stock experiences volatility. Their flagship Innovation ETF owned around 3.5 million Tesla shares in June, but by October 23, that number had fallen to 2.6 million shares, valued at $549.8 million. Despite this, Cathie Wood, Ark's CEO and investment lead, is still optimistic about their Tesla holdings.

Wood explained that Ark sells Tesla shares when the stock outperforms and reinvests in stocks with short-term concerns or significant underperformance relative to Tesla. They aim to increase their Tesla holdings during periods of stock underperformance.

Wood is also looking forward to the release of the Cybertruck in November, but she acknowledges potential near-term challenges and controversy, particularly related to profitability and scaling. Musk has indicated that the Cybertruck might not be profitable until scaling issues are addressed, which could take up to 18 months. Wood believes that the Cybertruck could be the next significant growth driver for Tesla. Tesla's shares have risen 76% for the year but experienced a slight decrease recently.",1596,False,1699355692.0,2023-11-07 12:14:52,0,44,Theo_011,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17przt8/cathie_wood_has_a_blunt_warning_about_teslas/,True,0.44,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

comment,17pyld0,17pyld0,,"I live in Florida and have been watching the stories of Teslas catching fire here.

*Yes*, Teslas are relatively water tight, and can be used as a ""submarine"" *to an extent*.

The last few hurricanes we've had always tend to end with people who own a Tesla, and drove through water with it, catching fire.

When a hurricane comes through, it is pulling salt water from the gulf, or the Atlantic, and dropping it into the state.

This means that when people are escaping hurricanes and opt to drive through puddles and such, post hurricane, in a lot of cases those puddles might in fact have salt water in them.

So, there's a belief that *yes*, a Tesla can be driven through water puddles, and relatively deep ones at that, *however*, you should try to avoid salt water.

In watching the video that accompanies the article, the dude states that the Model X ended up in the water at the Polk St boat launch ramp in Hollywood, FL.  Presumably that's [this spot](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Boat+Ramp/@26.014335,-80.1216065,1410m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x88d9ab15ec85a6cf:0x90c31d1582f5030e!8m2!3d26.0142556!4d-80.1215358!16s%2Fg%2F11bx1ycql2?entry=ttu)

post,17qznaf,,8 Reasons to Enter 8th Annual Climate XChange EV Raffle - and some questions,"I manage this 501c3 nonprofit fundraising raffle, and work with the winners to select and order their vehicles - which we then pay for. For six years it was a Tesla raffle; last year it started as a Tesla raffle but we added Rivian R1T and R1S options mid-stream, though the winner chose a Model X. This year I may be a bit crazy to be offering any EV, but we had feedback that people wanted more options than just Teslas and Rivians. There are some restrictions, the most important being the price and delivery date (we need to close out the raffle within our fiscal year):

1. The vehicle must be a fully battery-powered electric vehicle, not a hybrid or plug-in hybrid.
2. It must be a new vehicle offered for sale direct from the manufacturer or by a brand-authorized dealer.
3. Its price must fit within the Prize Vehicle Payout of $112,835, or the winner must pay any overage; in no case will Climate XChange pay above the Prize Vehicle Payout.
4. It must be readily available for delivery, so that the transaction can take place and payment from Climate XChange can be completed by June 30, 2024. If it is apparent on June 15, 2024 that this deadline cannot be met, the prize will default to the Alternate All-Cash Prize of $100,000.

So I've clearly opened myself up to potentially a lot more work this year. What EVs will be easy to find between the 2/29/24 drawing and our 6/30/24 deadline? What won't be? And what would you choose?

post,17ujkrp,,"Net Lease Office Properties (NLOP) - A classic ""toxic waste"" spinoff (Long thesis)","I tried posting this to r/stocks, but it was removed because the market cap is below 300m. As a result, you may see that the price I reference is no longer up to date. It was $13/sh a few days ago, and is now $15.50/sh but I believe it's still undervalued. I'm always trying to improve, so was hoping to get some feedback from any knowledgeable or experienced investors. Thanks for reading!

**THESIS SUMMARY**  
As of Nov 1, 2023, Net Lease Office Properties (NLOP) is a tiny, ugly, spinoff of W. P. Carey Inc (WPC). No one likes this thing. Due to poor sentiment, poor spinoff execution, a bad spin ratio, a large difference between the asset type of the Parent and SpinCo, uncertainty about the value of its assets, and even just the size of the company (sub-200m market cap), it's currently undergoing a heavy sell-off. Management from the Parent are going to also be running NLOP. They're going to be issued 750k shares and 1.5m options which haven't been struck yet, so they're incentivized to see a low initial trading price for the shares. NLOP's assets are high quality (even more so considering the craziness surrounding the office property industry at the moment), with large stable tenants, a reasonable WALT, and a low vacancy rate. Adjusted book value is 3.7x their current price. This book value will be realized over the next few years because the purpose of spinning off NLOP was to liquidate the assets without a fire sale. Oh, and the cherry on top is a likely 16%+ annual dividend while you wait for the properties to be sold.

  
**INTRODUCTION**  
W. P. Carey Inc (WPC) is a multi-billion dollar REIT that owns a variety of properties spanning Industrial, Retail, Warehouse, Office, and Self-Storage. They're seeing carnage in the Office segment; there are parts of Houston and San Fran with 30% vacancy rates. Since WPC has low vacancy rates with a reasonable WALT and great tenants, they figure now is the best time to sell their office properties.",20011,True,1699906239.0,2023-11-13 21:10:39,20,10,legaldrugdealer,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17ujkrp/net_lease_office_properties_nlop_a_classic_toxic/,True,0.86,2023,elon,search,False,False,0,

post,17v936i,,When renting a Model 3 be prepared,"Wanted to share a quick experience with renting an EV from Budget. This past weekend I rented a Tesla Model 3 or “or similar” from Budget for a 1200 round trip that would be completed in 36 hours. 

I’ve owned a model S in the past and am familiar with the supercharging system. This trip would be a breeze with that network and the basic autopilot that helps with driving fatigue. I was very excited to try the 3 and even mapped out my whole route lying in bed the evening prior. 

When I l arrived to pickup the car they immediately inform me they do not have model 3’s but they have an Ioniq 5 or a Bolt. The rep said that particular location doesn’t have model 3’s at all. I was very naive as it never occurred to me that I might not get a model 3. I was immediately concerned about making this trip after reading so many negative stories about it the CCS network reliability and availability. I also was disappointed because I knew nothing about those cars driver assist capabilities. 

Anyways, I opted for the Ioniq with a 35% charge instead of a Corolla and decided to make it an adventure learning about non-supercharging trips. All in all, I loved the Ioniq and only had one bad fast charging experience at an EVgo location. I would happily rent that car again. 

Next time I will call ahead to see what the true availability is. 

TLDR: be prepared to get a CCS EV when renting a “Model 3 or Similar”",1411,False,1699987464.0,2023-11-14 19:44:24,36,31,FLduckHunter,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/17v936i/when_renting_a_model_3_be_prepared/,True,0.88,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Tesla plans to start deliveries of the Cybertruck electric pickup on Nov. 30 and has started telegraphing that volumes will be limited, meaning early owners will likely be able to make a profit by reselling the highly anticipated vehicle.

To help prevent this, Tesla on Monday added a paragraph relating specifically to the Cybertruck in the terms and conditions section of the sales agreement buyers need to sign when purchasing a vehicle from the company, which stated that the buyer agrees to not resell the electric truck for at least one year after taking delivery, or face some consequences, including potentially a lawsuit.

By Tuesday, that paragraph was no longer included in the sales agreement. It likely means owners will be able to resell their Cybertrucks without Tesla coming after them, though the company could always reinstate the policy or something similar once the Cybertruck is actually on the market.",1072,False,1700154784.0,2023-11-16 18:13:04,1,0,Khalbrae,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/17ws4f6/tesla_backtracks_on_cybertrucks_resale_threat/k9ivuro/,True,,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,k9ivuro

For comparisons, here are latest videos from the tech giants Huawei and Baidu. Huawei's HDmap-less drive demo was on protected highways of its primary city Shanghai. No indication yet if Huawei is capable to taking mapless to city streets.

&#x200B;

Baidu operates robotaxi with those giant lidars just like Waymo in US. However, without the large lidar or HDmap, its demo of its first EV is pretty bad. The route is an easy suburb one, nowhere near the most complex city center streets.

&#x200B;

These two tech giants with tens of thousands of AI engineers are still struggling in a suburb of one city. XPeng's NGP is available for users in 29 cities, soon 54. 

Still don't believe XPeng is the one champion? VW bought into XPeng for its tech. VW EVs designed by XPeng will be launched next year. Tesla's FSD will be facing VWs with NGP in US in the near future. Didi, Uber of China, is partnering with XPeng too, guaranteeing 360k units sales of XPeng's Mona EV models over two years to take 5% shares of XPEV. Why would a ridehail operator guarantee EV sales? Because they will purchase units themselves for robotaxi operations. Finally, NVDA is partnering with XPeng, designing vehicle AI chips just for XPeng, which has requested less powerful and expensive chips. XPeng's software is so good that it can start to cut hardware costs. CEO of NVidia, Jensen, personally visited XPeng to receive head of NGP for a VP position in Nvidia.

post,17yx246,,Do you think electricity or gas will increase more yoy over the next 10yrs? EV vs ICE analysis,"I have been going down a rabbit hole of potentially buy an EV and it’s been astonishing to me, especially living in California, how unattractive it is to buy an EV. 

I will give you a few reasons why:

-I have to upgrade my electric panel to support charging 
-I have to switch to an EV plan through PG&E, which increases my partial and peak kilowatt an hour here is the breakdown of my summer rates (winter is lower by like 10 cents for both plans)

- **E-TOU-C** (current plan)
  - Peak (4-9 PM): 54 cents/kWh
  - Off-Peak: 46 cents/kWh
  - Lower rates for usage within Baseline Allowance.

- **EV2**:
  - Peak (4-9 PM): 59.068 cents/kWh
  - Part-Peak (3-4 PM & 9-12 AM): 48.019 cents/kWh
  - Off-Peak (All other hours): 27.818 cents/kWh
  - Delivery Minimum Bill: $0.37612 per meter per day.

-I have to pay someone to install a wall charger. Got a quote for $1900

-I have to pay an additional $103 a year to register an EV in CA

-On top of all these fees I don’t even qualify for many incentives as as a household we make over 300k which is honestly nothing crazy for coastal California when you factor in living expenses.

With all of these additional upfront costs and insane electric prices how does California expect people to adopt EVs? 

I really want to buy one but it seems like more of a statement play and potential car performance play then a smart economic choice. 

I did a cost comparison between a used Tesla Model X, a new Ford F-150 Lightning, and a new Toyota Grand Highlander Hybrid. Here's a summary including assumptions and formulas used.

**Assumptions:**
- Prices: $70,000 for the Tesla Model X, $65,500 for the Ford F-150 Lightning (after rebate), $56,000 for the Toyota Grand Highlander Hybrid.
- Annual miles driven: 13,500.
- Gas price: $5.73/gallon, Electricity price: $0.27/kWh.
- Toyota MPG: 31.
- EV maintenance costs are 60% of a gas vehicle's maintenance.

**Formulas:**
- Annual Fuel/Electricity Cost: `(Miles Driven / Efficiency) * Price per Unit`.",3115,True,1700400020.0,2023-11-19 14:20:20,0,290,chi3fer,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/17yx246/do_you_think_electricity_or_gas_will_increase/,True,0.41,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,17zyjos,,"What I test drove, what I bought, and why","I just bought my first EV (yay!) and thought I would share my shopping experience in case it helps anyone. It's long...

Importantly, if I lived somewhere other than where I am now, I might have made a different choice. I lived in San Diego for quite a few years, and now live in western Mass. Might have made different choices if I was still in SD.

What we looked at/drove:

1a. Hyundai Ioniq 5. The first to look at... we didn't drive it the first time because my husband veto'd it. He thought it was too small (it's not) and was still not sold on 100% electric. More on this later.

1b. We also looked at the Santa Fe PHEV at the same dealer. The trim felt a bit cheap, but I wasn't really serious about it because I knew I would eventually win the all EV battle. 

2. Volkswagen ID.4. Also didnt drive. I liked the look of it, husband didn't like the trim. For a small SUV/crossover, the trunk seemed a bit small for golf clubs. Dealership seemed really invested in selling EVs - they had a EV specialist that was busy when we were there, but even the non-specialist seemed very well informed. Husband was still holding out for PHEV, so he might have just been grumpy when we looked at it.

3. Nissan Ariya. First one I drove, took out the FWD version. More than any other car, it felt like an ICE. Both in the interior appointments (which maybe some folks like) but also in the driving feel. Sure, it was zippyier than our ICE, but I expected a bit more and was kinda disappointed. I suspect the AWD might have felt better. A rare FWD instead of RWD for an EV non-AWD version. No ""real"" one pedal driving. I wasn't sold for these reasons....
(The very young salesman did tell us a nice story during our drive about how last summer he hitchhiked all through western Mass because he was growing weed in the forest). 

4. Ford Mustang Mach e AWD. I really liked this car. A lot. Really, really a lot.

post,180ogg2,,Doug Demuro reviews the new Kia EV9.,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqkUkQyhBbc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqkUkQyhBbc)

Some interesting thoughts.  First, it's about the same length as a Telluride, but the wheelbase is a lot longer, they shifted the wheels further apart to focus on interior space, so that could make this punch above its weight and feel more like a full-size inside.

Base power for $56,000 is actually pretty underwhelming, only 215 horsepower with a RWD setup that gets 230 miles.  You can upgrade to extended range for 300+ miles, or you can upgrade to AWD which gets you 380 horsepower and 280 miles.  Definitely better, but it's no Mach-E GT (though to be fair, it's not really trying to be.)

I think really my main criticism is just that it's still way too expensive.  This starts at $56,000, and yes there will certainly be rebates, but a Telluride starts at the mid $36,000 range and its competitors like the Pilot and Highlander also start under $40,000.  We're still in this same problem period where the EV version of a gas vehicle is like 30-50% more expensive, so you have to not only be willing to commit to EV, you have to be willing to commit enough to spend $20,000 more for the privilege.

The GT-Line especially that he reviews is around $75,000, putting it up against the Rivian R1S and Model X, but also pretty close to traditional high-luxury SUV's like the Escalade, and obviously this will be cheaper to run than an Escalade, but my point is just that you can get a lot of amenities around the $80,000 range, and I'm not sure how many people would be willing to spend this much....for a Kia.",1606,False,1700593153.0,2023-11-21 19:59:13,0,62,Aromatic_Wallaby_433,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/180ogg2/doug_demuro_reviews_the_new_kia_ev9/,True,0.41,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Yes, in an ideal world, Tesla should stop cutting prices. But with the rates and an uncertain economy, it's tough to convince people to pay the same prices for Tesla vehicles as they were a year or two ago. If the rates were lower, Tesla wouldn't have to drop the prices as much as they have.

When Cybertruck was launched in 2019, Tesla stock was at roughly $23 a share. It enters this week at more than $230 a share.  
  
When Tesla launched the Cybertruck back in November 2019, shares fell 6.1% as investors digested the design. It took about a week for shares to regain their pre-Cybertruck level. What will happen to Tesla stock this week is anyone’s guess.

post,1862zhv,,F150 Lightning - Thanksgiving Trip Report: Austin to Omaha,"**Pre-trip:**

After a successful Texas to [Colorado EV road trip](https://www.reddit.com/r/F150Lightning/comments/15wpuez/2500_mile_trip_report_in_my_lariat_er/) this summer, my wife and I decided to forgo our PHEV Volvo and take the Lightning up to Omaha for Thanksgiving. Although I was a little concerned with the lower temperatures up north, after creating a route in ABRP I was confident the truck would be able to make the trip. With our dog and an 8-month-old along for the ride, the goal of this trip was not to min-max charging and stop time but to simply arrive with all passengers happy and not stranded on the side of the road. We made more stops than if we didn’t have the baby with us and I typically charged the truck to at least 80% instead of leaving once I had the minimum charge needed to reach the next charger. Even with the extra charging time, the truck was usually ready to go before we were. This will probably change once our son is older, but the baby helps mask the Lightning’s longer charging time to 80%. In an ICE, the trip to Omaha from Austin is a 12-hour drive on paper without stops and about 13.5 hours with stops and traffic. In the Lightning, ABRP predicted 16 hours. We opted to break the trip into two days with a stop overnight in Oklahoma City each way.

I purchased a month of EA Pass+ for the discount pricing. It saved me a significant amount of money on my Colorado trip, and I highly recommend you sign up before any road trip you take. Although EA has a reputation of being unreliable/slow, that was not my experience on the last road trip, but I didn’t keep great records of each stop. I felt my experience was too subjective. This time around I kept very detailed records of each charge to better quantify the quality of the DCFC sessions.

**The truck:**

* 2022 Lariat ER
* Cold tire pressure set to 47 psi
* Approximately 500 lbs.",14440,True,1701196235.0,2023-11-28 19:30:35,52,19,letstalkaboutrocks,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1862zhv/f150_lightning_thanksgiving_trip_report_austin_to/,True,0.95,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1864wq2,,"My thoughts on upgrading from a 2022 Model 3 Performance to a Model S (standard, not Plaid)","TLDR; If you are driving a Model 3 Performance, the base Model S with standard wheels is a *very* nice upgrade.

Context: I had a 2019 Model 3 Performance. Loved it. It was leased, so switched to a 2022 Model 3 Performance. The 2019 had better fit and finish than the 2022. The 2022's battery also degraded faster than the older car. I probably lucked out and got a peach 2019, but whatever. Both cars were excellent fun. That said, the crashy suspension was starting to annoy me, and I wanted more range. So got a base 2023 Model S with the standard wheels for range and comfort. Ordered Midnight Silver, it got changed to Stealth Grey.

So here are my thoughts on the differences between a Model 3 Performance and a standard Model S:

 - The Model S is much better looking (duh).
 - The fit and finish is pretty good - the panel gaps are a little wider than I would like, but I don't have any alignment issues. It is better than the Model 3 - my Model 3's trunk was slightly out of square, causing a slight jiggle when closing.
 - The initial paint quality is excellent. So was the Model 3. As to how it holds up over time, I do not know. I have PPF on the front.
 - The performance is similar. I know it is supposed to be a bit faster (same 0 to 60, but the Model S measures it without the 1 foot rollout) but the difference is too small to notice. They are both so, so fast.
 - The handling is good, but I can feel that the car is larger to drive. I have to pay a bit more attention to keep the car centered in the lane and when turning. As for actual handling, I don't drive at the limit, so both seem equally capable to me.
 - The S is *much* more comfortable! I knew that going in, but the difference is pretty stark. Now, I probably would have had better comfort if I had the standard wheels on my Model 3 rather than the larger performance wheels, but I still think the S is more comfortable.
 - The S is much quieter inside. Much less noise coming in from the outside.",4587,True,1701201003.0,2023-11-28 20:50:03,316,224,syslog2000,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1864wq2/my_thoughts_on_upgrading_from_a_2022_model_3/,True,0.89,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,18b05xu,,New Cybertruck EPA & CARB Certifications Spotted,"Within the last 24 hours several new Cybertruck documents have appeared on the EPA's website:

[Application for Cybertruck Beast](https://dis.epa.gov/otaqpub/display_file.jsp?docid=58898&flag=1)

[Application for Cybertruck AWD](https://dis.epa.gov/otaqpub/display_file.jsp?docid=58897&flag=1)

[Certificate Summary Information for Cybertruck AWD](https://dis.epa.gov/otaqpub/display_file.jsp?docid=58895&flag=1)

Usually the applications contain test results for the EPA's highway & city range cycles, though these initial submissions only contain dummy data and as such the official EPA rated range is not yet known, however some interesting details can still be gleaned:

* Both trucks feature a nominal 816 V and 150 Ah pack making for a pack size of about 122.4 kWh, which is in line with current speculation of 123 kWh
* The Beast variant features two rear permanent magnet motors making 212 kW (284 hp) each while the front permanent magnet motor makes 206 kW (276 hp)
* The AWD variant has an AC induction motor in front and permanent magnet motor in rear rated at 226 kW (303 hp) and 222 kW (297 hp)
* Curb weights are 6669 lbs (AWD) and 6898 lbs (Beast)

As part of the certification process Tesla is required to submit settings for dynamometer calibration by performing a Coastdown test in accordance with [standardized test procedures](https://dis.epa.gov/otaqpub/display_file.jsp?docid=34102&flag=1).  From these settings one can determine the Vehicle Road-Load Force experienced at various speeds, letting you plot an efficiency curve that can be directly compared to other vehicles using their EPA submissions.  Here are these curves for the Cybertruck against some existing EV trucks:

comment,18btp61,18btp61,,"“ — 
Danish dockworkers and drivers are threatening to stop transporting Teslas to neighboring Sweden if the carmaker does not reach a deal with striking Swedish workers within two weeks.

Denmark’s 3F labor union said the planned “sympathy strike” is aimed at putting extra pressure on a Tesla (TSLA) subsidiary to recognize Swedish labor union IF Metall, which would enable collective bargaining over wages and other terms of employment.

It is the first time a labor union outside of Sweden has threatened industrial action against Tesla in solidarity with the Swedish workers.

                This is about good wages, good pensions and good insurance for all our members who work at Tesla,” IF Metall said on its website.
                We have been negotiating with Tesla for a long time.     They have refused to sign a collective agreement and 
                 violate basic principles in the Swedish labor market.”

On Tuesday, the spokesperson for Denmark’s 3F, said its dockworkers and drivers would not handle Teslas destined for Sweden, referring to “speculation” that the carmaker would try to circumvent the Swedish port blockade by shipping its vehicles to Danish ports for onward delivery via truck.

Such a workaround “is no longer possible,” the union spokesperson said.",1800,True,1701830467.0,2023-12-06 03:41:07,6,0,BikkaZz,business,https://reddit.com/r/business/comments/18btp61/teslas_clash_with_swedish_workers_risks_spilling/kc6e9me/,True,,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,kc6e9me

post,18ex45r,,Small comparison,"I have had the opportunity to drive 3 EVs, the Kia EV6, the Model Y, and the Mach-E (which I own). I have some thoughts, and I thought I would share them in case someone else is trying to make a buying decision and isn’t sure what to buy.

Let’s talk about the Model Y first, especially since it is the best selling car in America right now. I got it as a rental for a few days while running some errands around town, and it is honestly a really good car. It charges fast, the screen provides a ton of information, it is quick, and it handles like a much smaller vehicle. That is where my positivity about this vehicle stops. The build quality that often gets discussed isn’t a big deal, but it feels extremely spartan in the interior. Everything being on the screen means that I am looking farther to my right whenever I need to check the map to see where I am going. That leads to me not paying enough attention to what is in front of me, which, when I was relying on autopilot caused emergency braking to activate on the highway. Autopilot is a substandard system in this day and age, especially with the multiple phantom braking instances I dealt with. Parking with vision only is garbage, you can’t trust it enough to rely on it, so I had to repark a few times (but this could also just be due to me not feeling comfortable).  ~~And for all the hype about the software, not being able to use android auto or apple carplay is stupid, since I would be googling where I am going to type the address into the Tesla Nav (A waste of time)~~ (You can apparently send it to the car through the app. My bad.) . Finally, I had the screen just shut down on me while driving back from the grocery store, which legitimately felt like an unsafe situation since I was driving pretty much blind in regards to my speed.

*****
> U.S. stock futures ticked higher Wednesday as investors await the Federal Reserve’s latest policy decision.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose by 42 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.1% each.
*****
> The central bank is widely anticipated to hold the benchmark overnight borrowing rate steady in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, but investors will also parse through Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s commentary for clues into how soon rate cuts can be expected. As it is, the CME FedWatch Tool shows markets are pricing in odds of rate cuts beginning next spring.
*****
> But that’s a scenario Powell may choose to push back on, especially as Treasury yields pull back on their own. The 10-year Treasury yield has fallen to 4.2% after topping 5% in October.
*****
> “He may hint that’s doing some of the prospective easing,” Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
> “That’s, to me, what I’m going to be focused on, is whether he sort of does the opposite of what he did when he said that the move up in yields had done some of the tightening for the Fed,” Sonders added.
*****
> Investors will also keep an eye on the November producer price index, set for release 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday ahead of the Fed decision. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a rise of 0.1%, up from a 0.5% decline the prior month. Excluding food and energy, it’s anticipated to have risen 0.2%, up from a flat reading the previous month.

comment,18hqkxn,18hqkxn,,"WASHINGTON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) is recalling over 2 million vehicles in the U.S. to install new safeguards in its Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system, after a federal safety regulator cited safety concerns.

The largest-ever Tesla recall appears to cover nearly all vehicles on U.S. roads to better ensure drivers pay attention when using the system. Tesla's recall filing said that Autopilot's software system controls ""may not be sufficient to prevent driver misuse"" and could increase the risk of a crash.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has spent over two years investigating whether vehicles produced by the electric automaker led by billionaire Elon Musk adequately ensure drivers pay attention.

Acting NHTSA Administrator Ann Carlson praised Tesla for agreeing to the recall. ""One of the things we determined is that drivers are not always paying attention when that system is on,"" she said at a U.S. House hearing.

Carlson said the agency opened a safety probe in August 2021 when she kept hearing about fatal crashes involving use of Autopilot. ""My immediate response was, 'We have to do something about this,'"" she said.

Separately, Transport Canada said Tesla will recall 193,000 vehicles to address the Autopilot issue.

I don't think that's true? The first I saw was on roads around their office, with a guy in the seat not touching the wheel, with obviously a dev build and a common environment. Considering how far the tech was even back then, I'd think staging it would have been more work than to just let the system work.


> still not producing any really impressive results

What. FSD is the way ahead of anyone else. They are the only ones actually trying to make autonomous driving work on _all_ roads with a generalist approach. They have proven this is a very hard problem but they have also proven they're ahead others solving it. A competitor would need the equal of the FSD chip to avoid lugging around 3-10 GPUs worth of cargo taking multiple kW's. This is also a good part of the reason I invested in TSLA before they blew up after Autonomy Day as I saw how they were ahead, and nothing has really proven that point untrue, just that they were optimistic in the scale of the challenge this kind of tech has against infinitely unique real life RNG.

About FSD fitting the robot, Tesla has pointed out the work they are doing translates very well to Optimus. It would be a bit silly to even have it otherwise.

post,18lyz17,,"Is Tesla the Ultimate Investment? Garry Breaks Down the Numbers, Growth, and Unveils the EV Game-Changer!","According to Garry, Investment advisor,Tesla ($TSLA) currently sits at $250 per share, trading at 58 times his estimated 2024 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $4.30. Garry's take on this? He believes it's a reasonable valuation, especially when considering the projected +28% increase in volume and an impressive +32% growth in EPS between now and 2030. This positions Tesla's Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio at 1.8x, notably lower than Apple's ($AAPL) 3.0x PEG.

Garry's outlook extends to global EV adoption, forecasting a rise from the current 13% to a substantial 60% by 2030, sporting a +24% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CGR). With faith in the Cybertruck and Tesla's $25,000 next-gen vehicle, Garry expects Tesla to boost its global EV market share from 16% to 20% by 2030. The outcome? Tesla's vehicle volumes surging from 1.8 million in 2023 to 2.4 million in 2024 and an impressive 10.2 million by 2030 (+28% CGR).

Factoring in aspects like auto gross margin expansion, contributions from energy, operating leverage, and cash reinvestment, Garry foresees Tesla's Adjusted EPS climbing from $3.20 in 2023 to $22 in 2030 (+32% CGR). Interestingly, Garry's projections don't include potential revenues from Full Self-Driving (FSD) licensing, robotaxi ventures, or other futuristic elements. However, they do consider FSD at a 15% global take rate and energy revenues rising by a factor of eight.

The central question, as per Garry's analysis, is whether a P/E ratio of 58x is too steep for the premier EV player, set to experience a +28% CGR in volume and +32% CGR in EPS. Garry challenges you to find another mega-cap stock with this level of growth and valuation, particularly with traditional automakers pulling back from their EV commitments.

post,18m38qb,,Toyota Industries to Increase Supply to Tesla by 2.5 Times for EV-Use Electric Compressors,"Translated from japanese

Toyota Industries will expand its supply of electric compressors for electric vehicle (EV) air conditioners to Tesla. The company has a 70% share of the market for this component in Tesla vehicles, and it expects to ship 2.5 times as many units in 2026 as it did in 2022, for a total of about 2.5 million units. Toyota is also working to strengthen its production base to meet the growing demand from European and American automakers that are leading the EV market.

According to interviews with industry insiders, electric compressors are the heart of car air conditioners, which regulate the temperature inside the car. The compressor compresses the refrigerant, making it hot, and then expands it, creating cold air. In electric vehicles (EVs), electric compressors also play a role in cooling the battery and heating the cabin, and they are required to have high performance.

Toyota Industries provides electric compressors for Tesla's main sedan, the Model 3, as well as the versatile sports utility vehicles (SUVs) Model Y and Model X. While Tesla began shipping its electric pickup truck, the Cybertruck, at the end of November, Toyota lost a bidding competition for supplying components for that model. Despite this setback, they are intensifying efforts to secure contracts for other vehicle models by actively promoting their electric compressors.

Tesla's 2022 electric vehicle (EV) production increased 47% from the previous year to approximately 1.37 million units. Tesla plans to introduce new models and expand its factories in the future. S&P Global Mobility, a research firm, estimates that Tesla's production will reach 3.65 million units in 2026. Toyota's shipments of electric compressors to Tesla were approximately 1 million units in 2022, but are expected to expand to approximately 2.5 million units in 2026.

In response to the global shift to electrification, Toyota Industries is strengthening its production base for electric compressors.",4452,True,1702996339.0,2023-12-19 15:32:19,98,99,deppaotoko,electricvehicles,https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOFD293GB0Z21C23A1000000/,False,0.92,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,18m9qyj,,Active Investing? Really?,"Not that I trust the first article I read but saw this on CNN today. Jack Manley, global market strategist at JPMorgan says that active investing is the way to go in 2024. I am curious to know what folks on this thread think.

Given below is a link to the article and a copy-paste of the relevant section. 

[https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/19/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/19/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html)

It’s all about active management   
  
A common theme across 2024 outlooks is that investors will do well to actively manage their portfolios next year. That’s a bit different than the ‘set it and forget it’ long-run investment advice that typically prevails among portfolio managers.  
  
Stocks and bonds have been unusually volatile this year, behaving in ways that aren’t consistent with economic expectations, wrote Jack Manley, global market strategist at JPMorgan. Given those “significant dislocations,” he said “simply owning the indices will not suffice.”

post,18nz6j0,,I bought my first EV. This is why I picked the RS e-Tron GT (and was it worth it...?),"Ok, so first, full disclosure, I didn't actually buy it. I leased it. For a year. Because things are changing so rapidly (e.g. NACS becoming a standard, solid state batteries, etc.) that I didn't want to be stuck making payments on outdated tech. But I also wanted an EV, partly because my other daily is a gas guzzler and I felt bad, partly because I wanted to make a difference, partly because buying gas sucks, and partly because I was having a serious case of FOMO and wanted in on the new and shiny. This is my journey:

**My Requirements**

1. BEV
2. Sedan or coupe
3. Sexy
4. Luxury car
5. AWD for winter driving
6. Not a Tesla.

That's really it. I had a lot of range in budget, size, brand, etc. I just knew I wanted an EV that was at least as nice as the CLS450 it was replacing.

**The Competition, or What Did I Look At?**

* ***Tesla Model S Plaid:*** Obviously if you're going to look at higher-end EVs, you have to start with the king (even though I had already made up my mind not to support Musk for all sorts of reasons.) The king, it turns out, isn't wearing any clothes. The MSP is awful. It's basically a classic American muscle car, but in all the worst ways. Build quality is much improved over earlier generations, though still not amazing. But the chassis, suspension, and braking are just horrible. It's overly harsh, the traction control has schizophrenia, running over a pebble mid-corner will unbalance the whole car, and the brakes were fading halfway through my test drive. Maybe the CCBs are better, but the chassis is still a deathtrap. Hard pass.
* ***Tesla Model 3 Performance:*** The best car you can buy right now if you're looking for a toaster to get you from A to B. Really, if you just want a car and you don't care about supporting Musk, stop looking and just go pick up a Model 3 or Y. For me, it was just too... beige. It looks boring, it drives boring, and anywhere you go you'll be one out of fifty identical cars.

Last week, Tesla announced a recall for nearly all its U.S. vehicles — some 2 million — due to concerns about the safety of its autopilot driver-assistance feature. A federal investigation found that its autosteer function may have led some drivers to abandon responsibility for the operation of their vehicles.

That recall came after one in February affecting more than 360,000 vehicles related to Tesla's ""full self-driving"" software.”

post,18v3s5e,,Investing in software companies (tin foil chat),"Wanted to share some thought on how to pick stocks in technology. I want to focus on the quality of revenue. I did t know this until I spoke with a few experts and got me thinking about fraud and if there is a method to spot fraud in technology consistently. 

I was brought up in the UK in the 90s and 00s where some managers made a fortune by investing in internet companies. Most of those people were long only investors and the horizon was super long. Their main thesis was around changes in society, habitual changes, that would have led to some internet companies to show abnormal growth in stock price. Amazon, Google, FB, Microsoft etc. These managers literally became millionaires. 

The legacy of these managers dies hard and there are many money managers betting on healthcare tech (bio tech), food industries or energy transition. Their bets are almost always driven by top down analysis, instead of understanding the operations of each company. Most of these firms generate their money from licensing. 

Licensing revenue has distinct characteristics such as
- multi year firm wide contract 
- cost of switching tends to be expensive 
- once signed, your revenue is basically guaranteed for a good few years 

One often overlooked is the fact that companies have a great leeway on when to book/show sales and cancellations in their book if and when these multi year licensing contracts get cancelled.

Imagine a hypothetical scenario where a firm sells a licensing agreement. The customer gives a notice or intent to cancel this licensing agreement at the end of the term or even in the middle of it for whatever reasons.  
- there is often penalty involved in early termination 
- the notice period is longer often in months

How does this cancellation appear in your quarterly or semi annual reports?

For this potential loss to appear in the official report, you would need this cancellation to be passed to a relevant department and recorded.",3910,True,1704013141.0,2023-12-31 09:59:01,1,0,Late-Ad-9930,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/18v3s5e/investing_in_software_companies_tin_foil_chat/,True,0.56,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

*Meta and Microsoft, each purchasing 150,000 GPUs. Those two companies were responsible for 300,000 units, with the other 200,000 going to the rest: Oracle, Tencent, Google, and Amazon, Tesla, TickTok, Baidu, Alibaba.*  


***Q3 reported revenue was 18 bills. The reported 500k number seems to be true.***    


**Now the question is, who will be ordering another 500k batch in Q4? so that at least the Q4 result won't pale in comparison and won't be a disappointment for investors?**  


META to the rescue (Hopefully)! As Zuckerberg stated:

[*“By the end of this year, we’re going to have around 350,000 Nvidia H100s. Or around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute if you include other GPUs.”*](https://www.pcmag.com/news/zuckerbergs-meta-is-spending-billions-to-buy-350000-nvidia-h100-gpus)  
, which means they might order another 200k from Nvidia, or he may *""find 2\*x H100 equivalent to compute""* to avoid paying a premium over generally specialized Nvidia GPUs and buy more specialized and power-to-output optimized ASICs chips like Google's TPUs.  

  
I don't think other big tech (Microsoft, OpenAI, and AWS) giants will order more GPUs because running a general-purpose GPU is very expensive: [Running ChatGPT is very expensive for the company. Each query costs roughly 4 cents, according to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/)

post,1adgztd,,Tesla's Bull Case,"I see a lot of negative sentiment around Tesla and a true lack of understanding of what is to come.

I have been in Tesla since 2017 and this company has evolved in ways I never imagined.

I am more bullish today than I have ever been.

This is not investment advice and I honestly don't care whether you buy, sell, short, use options or anything else.

&#x200B;

People see Tesla's market cap of approximately $575 billion and immediately think it's overvalued.  They only make X amount, they only sold X amount, and Elon said/did this today.

&#x200B;

If it were as easy as looking at what a company currently is, or what they have done, everyone would be rich.  That is not how investing works.  There needs to be an understanding of what the future will look like.

&#x200B;

The future I see is one of abundance of labor, energy, time, etc.

&#x200B;

Tesla is set up to capitalize like no other company in history and become larger than anything anyone has ever built before.

&#x200B;

Lets focus on the now for a moment though.

&#x200B;

Things to understand, the company has the #1 selling vehicle in the world.  Not just #1 EV, it's the #1 car.

The TAM for there current lineup of vehicles is approaching it's cap with current interest rates and pricing.  The growth will be moderate compared to what people are use too from Tesla.

The current lineup of vehicles is printing money for them though, which is padding there balance sheet now with $29 billion in cash, about 5% of the market cap and the rest covering all of their current investments in the future and operations.

So for 2024 we can expect moderate volume growth and everyone already knows.

What will margins look like in 2024, nobody really knows, some people think it will continue to trend down, some people think it bottomed in Q3, when it bounced up slightly in Q4. Regardless I know that they will be printing more money and strengthening their balance sheet further while growing current projects.",5955,True,1706485835.0,2024-01-29 00:50:35,0,154,PricedIn18,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1adgztd/teslas_bull_case/,True,0.46,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

Your big growth driver for Tesla is energy? That's not a very high growth industry, with fairly low profit margins. It's not a luxury item. You cannot overcharge for it. Furthermore, unlike software, it's constrained by physical factors, like how fast can you install your equipment, and margins are cut down by materials and labor costs. 

The only way for Tesla to grow is to move away from selling goods like cars and solar and batteries to selling software. That's the only reason why we view it as a tech company, because it can scale with software without physical bottleneck.

post,1bhuhzh,,Lemon-Musk interview: Musk teases Tesla flying cars w/ SpaceX. Stock is up 6%. Are flying cars baked in the stock price?,"""*Billionaire Elon Musk has teased the possibility of producing a commercially-available flying car as the next generation of Tesla vehicles.*

*In an interview with journalist Don Lemon released in full on Monday morning, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO was asked about the new model of the Roadster—the car manufacturer's original design—which is due to be released next year. ""Look, I don't want to give away much more than what I've said publicly, except that the Roadster will be a collaboration between SpaceX and Tesla—so you can expect some rocket-y stuff there,"" he said.*  
*Asked by Lemon if it could be a flying car, Musk responded: ""Maybe,"" before waggling his head and laughing. ""It's not out of the question. I've got to reserve the cool stuff for when we actually unveil it, but it's going to be really cool; it's going to have some rocket technology in it.""*

*He added: ""I think, really, the only way to do something that's cooler than the Cybertruck is to combine SpaceX and Tesla technology to create something that's not ever really a car.""*

*""Then what would it be?"" Lemon asked.*

*""Something that's never existed before,"" Musk said, before agreeing with Lemon that it would have ""Jetsons vibes,"" a reference to the space age Hanna-Barbera cartoon which features flying cars.*

***The Context***:

*Tesla would not be the first company to attempt to build a commercially viable flying car. Several start-ups have been making use of advances in electric vehicle technology in recent years to design vehicles that hope to live up to science fiction.*

*Most recently, San Mateo, California-based start-up Alef previously told Newsweek its prototype—which received Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) approval for testing last year, and operates using a hollow body and internal rotors—was in the works. The company said pre-orders for the $300,000 vehicle had surged since the start of 2023.",3290,True,1710778205.0,2024-03-18 17:10:05,376,380,LackingStory,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bhuhzh/lemonmusk_interview_musk_teases_tesla_flying_cars/,True,0.75,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1bpy94c,,Xiaomi releases electric car $4K cheaper than Tesla's Model 3 as price wars heat up,"Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi said Thursday it will sell its first car for far less than Tesla’s Model 3, as price wars heat up in China’s fiercely competitive electric car market.

Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said the standard version of the SU7 will sell for 215,900 yuan ($30,408) in the country — a price he acknowledged would mean the company was selling each car at a loss.

Tesla’s Model 3 starts at 245,900 yuan in China.

Lei claimed the standard version of the SU7 beat the Model 3 on more than 90% of its specifications, except on two aspects that he said it might take Xiaomi at least three to five years to catch up with Tesla on. He also said the SU7 had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus the Model 3′s 606 kilometers. The company said orders had exceeded 50,000 cars in the 27 minutes since sales started at 10 p.m. Beijing time Thursday.

Deliveries are set to start by the end of April, Lei said. Lei also claimed that Xiaomi’s car factory, for which all “key” steps are fully automated, can produce an SU7 every 76 seconds. It was not immediately clear whether the factory was fully operational.

Earlier this week, the Xiaomi CEO said on social media the SU7 would be the best sedan “under 500,000 yuan” ($69,328).

The car is entering a fiercely competitive market in China, where companies are launching a slew of new models and cutting prices in order to survive. Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has partnered with traditional automakers, most notably launching the Aito brand whose vehicles are often on display in Huawei smartphone showrooms.

Tesla’s Model 3 is the best-selling new energy sedan in China that has a driving range of at least 600 kilometers (372 miles) and costs less than 500,000 yuan, according to data from industry website Autohome.

BYD’s Han sedan starts at 169,800 yuan, according to Autohome.

post,1bwtyff,,Elon Musk says Tesla will unveil its robotaxi on Aug. 8; shares pop,"Tesla will reveal its robotaxi product on Aug. 8, CEO Elon Musk said in a social media post on X.

Musk has spoken about the robotaxi project for years, and it could represent a major new business for the carmaker as investors grow wary of the company during a period of slowing growth.

Tesla shares rose over 3% in extended trading after Musk’s tweet.

Musk shared the release date on Friday after Reuters reported that plans for Tesla’s highly anticipated low-cost car model had been scrapped. Musk accused Reuters of “lying.”

Tesla’s robotaxi project, according to Musk’s past remarks, would allow Tesla vehicles to use self-driving technology to autonomously pick up riders for fares. In 2019, Musk said that he expected to have over 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020. Author Walter Isaacson also mentioned the robotaxi project in his biography of Musk, published in 2022.

Currently, Tesla offers advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS,) including its Autopilot option, as well as a premium Full Self-Driving “FSD” option, which costs $199 per month for subscribers. However, Teslas currently cannot operate without human intervention.

There is significant competition in the market for taxi services that use self-driving cars.

Alphabet’s autonomous vehicle unit Waymo operates driverless ride-hailing services in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and is now ramping up in Tesla’s home base of Austin, Texas.

GM’s Cruise service previously offered self-driving car services in San Francisco before being wound down under regulatory scrutiny after an accident. Since the incident, Cruise’s robotaxi fleet has been grounded, local and federal governments have launched their own investigations and Cruise leadership has been gutted.

And that location maybe a block away from your preset location.

Tesla self driving on the other hand is way behind in San Francisco. It always turn into bike or bus lanes for no reason, blocking traffic trying to make lane switch last minute since it was on the wrong lane until right before a turn.

Tesla’s Cybertruck has been widely derided. Its panel gaps are wide and amateurish, it’s prone to rust, and it looks like an ergonomic cheese grater. Its most serious flaw to date, though, has resulted in a recall of nearly 4,000 vehicles.

The US National Highway Traffic Safety Association has recalled 3,878 Cybertrucks, which comprises any that were manufactured between November 13 of last year and April 4. At issue is the accelerator pedal: Its pad can become dislodged, resulting in the pedal becoming trapped in the trim above it. This is, needless to say, quite bad.

post,1c9qktm,,"Tesla cuts prices nearly $2,000 in China, in line with U.S. cuts","Tesla has cut prices by nearly $2,000 across its models in China, after price cuts in the United States, as it grapples with falling sales and an intensifying price war for electric vehicles (EVs), especially against cheaper Chinese EVs.

Elon Musk’s EV maker cut the starting price of the revamped Model 3 in China by 14,000 yuan ($1,930) to 231,900 yuan, its official website showed on Sunday.

Tesla made similar cuts to the Model Y starting price, now 249,900 yuan, the regular version of the Model S to 684,900 yuan and the Model S Plaid to 814,900 yuan. The regular Model X now costs 724,900 yuan and its plaid variant 824,900 yuan.

The carmaker on Friday cut U.S. prices of its Model Y, Model X and Model S vehicles by $2,000. On Saturday it slashed the price of its Full Self-Driving driver assistant software to $8,000 from $12,000 in the United States.

Tesla reported this month that its global vehicle deliveries in the first quarter fell for the first time in nearly four years, as price cuts failed to stir demand.

The EV maker has been slow to refresh its ageing models as high interest rates have sapped consumer appetite for big-ticket items, while rivals in China, the world’s largest auto market, are rolling out cheaper models.

Musk postponed a planned trip this weekend to India, where he was to have met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, citing obligations at Tesla. The trip was to have included the announcement of plans for Tesla to enter the South Asian market, Reuters has reported on Saturday.

Musk said last Monday that Tesla will lay off more than 10% of its global workforce as the automaker is bracing for its first annual drop in deliveries.

The announcement came after Reuters reported on April 5 that Tesla had scrapped its plan to develop its long-awaited affordable EV in favour of robotaxis. Musk posted that “Reuters is lying” after the report, without citing any inaccuracies.",2252,True,1713728258.0,2024-04-21 21:37:38,636,186,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1c9qktm/tesla_cuts_prices_nearly_2000_in_china_in_line/,True,0.94,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1cb4vkz,,Why Aren't More Businesses Managed Like Publix Supermarkets?,"Please be kind, I'm making this post to find understanding and gain perspective. Thank you.

If you're not familiar, there is a grocery store chain in Florida. Publix Supermarkets. Even if you're not from the South, there is a chance you're familiar with the chain. It's known for its clean stores, exceptional service, brand recognition, and for treating its customers with dignity. The business is well over fifty years old. Many of their long-time employees, 20-30 years, have the status of ""Publix Millionaires."" This is due to the internal stock program within the company.

I'm curious as to why more companies don't use this model.  If a small supermarket chain can do it, why can't more companies (tech, financial firms, etc) do it? I'm not saying it's the best model, but why don't why celebrate companies like Publix, and encourage a culture that does this? To think that a little Southern supermarket has less turnover and more employee/customer/market trust than a billion-dollar company like Tesla makes me chuckle. Hell, Publix might last longer than Tesla!

At the same time, can someone enlighten me on what makes Publix a successful business from a  development perspective? Where is could improve? Honestly, I only have a general (mostly lament) understanding of business development. 

Again, thank you!

post,1cc3dtf,,INTC vs TSLA - Trying to understand market sentiment.,"Forgive my naive question but I'm really trying to wrap my head around these two stocks (stockholder in both).  
  
INTC - Semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse. Still has a majority in data center and pc CPU space. I do agree that they fell behind TSMC and Samsung in terms of process leadership and don't have a serious product offering in the GPU space that can take on Nvidia H100 (Gaudi 3 seems like a good competitor). And Pat Gelsinger is trying hard to bring it back on track. They have 18A process node on track to hit HVM production in 2025(?), US government is funding their fab expansion plans, Foundry is slowly winning customer, and for the next few years, compute is the new oil. Everything seems to be inline for INTC to go up like AMD and NVDA. But no, it always drops.  
  
TSLA - Eccentric owner who is more interested in peddling conspiracy theories on X that he bought on a whim. FSD was a long lost pipe dream, which never seems to be working fine , and current version has its own kinks. EV is becoming an extremely competitive market everyday with new entrants and an ongoing price war. Cybertruck was late by 2-3(?) years and has. IDK if Roadster will ever happen in this decade, Tesla Semi is another thing which seemed nice on paper but idk if it's ever really gonna happen. News reports claimed that Musk cancelled Model2. But again claims TSLA is gonna make a cheaper model ( which would probably cannibalize Model 3 and Model Y sales; and lets be honest - no one knows if and when that's actually coming on the roads).  
  
Can anyone explain why is the market so bullish about TSLA even after reporting lower EPS, 9% drop in revenue, and is ready to eat his words about the cheaper model like its God's truth itself, while INTC drops like a rock on the first opportunity, even though Semiconductors are the bedrock of AI and EV growth.",1873,False,1713977925.0,2024-04-24 18:58:45,90,100,EuclidianEigenvalue,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cc3dtf/intc_vs_tsla_trying_to_understand_market_sentiment/,True,0.81,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1ce2p7z,,Tesla Autopilot has 'critical safety gap' linked to hundreds of collisions: NHTSA,"Federal authorities say a “critical safety gap” in Tesla’s Autopilot system contributed to at least 467 collisions, 13 resulting in fatalities and “many others” resulting in serious injuries.

The findings come from a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration analysis of 956 crashes in which Tesla Autopilot was thought to have been in use. The results of the nearly three-year investigation were published Friday.

Tesla’s Autopilot design has “led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes,” the NHTSA report said. The system did not “sufficiently ensure driver attention and appropriate use.”

NHTSA’s filing pointed to a “weak driver engagement system,” and Autopilot that stays switched on even when a driver isn’t paying adequate attention to the road or the driving task. The driver engagement system includes various prompts, including “nags” or chimes, that tell drivers to pay attention and keep their hands on the wheel, as well as in-cabin cameras that can detect when a driver is not looking at the road. 

The agency also said it was opening a new probe into the effectiveness of a software update Tesla previously issued as part of a recall in December. That update was meant to fix Autopilot defects that NHTSA identified as part of this same investigation.

The voluntary recall via an over-the-air software update covered 2 million Tesla vehicles in the U.S., and was supposed to specifically improve driver monitoring systems in Teslas equipped with Autopilot.

NHTSA suggested in its report Friday that the software update was probably inadequate, since more crashes linked to Autopilot continue to be reported.

In one recent example, a Tesla driver in Snohomish County, Washington, struck and killed a motorcyclist on April 19, according to records obtained by CNBC and NBC News. The driver told police he was using Autopilot at the time of the collision.",5049,True,1714182190.0,2024-04-27 03:43:10,441,154,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ce2p7z/tesla_autopilot_has_critical_safety_gap_linked_to/,True,0.84,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1cn05bd,,TSLA - Robotaxi in Mainland China instead of the United States?,"Tesla is betting on Robotaxi this year.

Instead of launching in the United States (subject to numerous regulatory approvals across various states), probably Tesla is pushing for a soft launch in Mainland China ...

Bullish or bearish?

&#x200B;

EDIT:

Subsequent to the initial post, Reuters published an article indicating that US prosecutors are examining whether Tesla committed securities or wire fraud by misleading investors and consumers about its electric vehicles’ self-driving capabilities. Seems like Robotaxi by Tesla is still very remote for the US market ...

The agency's letter said it had identified ""several concerns"", regarding the recall.*

*Tesla said in December its largest-ever recall covering 2.03 million U.S. vehicles - or nearly all of its vehicles on U.S. roads - was to better ensure drivers pay attention when using its advanced driver assistance system.*

post,1cnicsr,,NIO's Strategic Charge in the Global EV Market,"Investing in NIO, despite its current operational losses and significant debt levels, can be considered a forward-looking strategy, particularly for those who are bullish on the future of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable technologies. 

NIO's debt is largely a reflection of its aggressive investment in research and development, infrastructure, and expanding production capabilities. These investments are critical for gaining a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving EV market. By financing growth and innovation, NIO is positioning itself to capture a significant share of the global EV market, which is expected to grow substantially.  NIO is not just focusing on the Chinese market but is also eyeing expansion into Europe and potentially other international markets, giving it more growth opportunities.

The automotive industry is undergoing a significant transformation, moving away from fossil fuels to electric and hybrid vehicles. This shift is expected to continue due to the decreasing cost of batteries, improved EV infrastructure, and increasing societal awareness about climate change.

However the journey to other countries such as America does not come without challenges, especially with the  giant EV manufacturer Tesla running the show. Tesla has a strong brand presence in the U.S., recognized for pioneering the electric car industry and backed by high-profile CEO Elon Musk. Tesla's brand is associated with innovation, quality, and sustainability, aspects that resonate well with American consumers. NIO, while a recognized brand in China and some parts of Europe, would need marketing efforts to establish similar recognition in the U.S.  For NIO to compete effectively, it will need to differentiate its vehicles through unique features, possibly focusing on its innovative Battery as a Service (BaaS) model, advanced autonomous driving capabilities, and superior interior luxury, which are some of NIO's strong suits.",3003,True,1715209810.0,2024-05-09 01:10:10,0,1,YoungChopOnDaBeat,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1cnicsr/nios_strategic_charge_in_the_global_ev_market/,True,0.44,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

And I am really wondering how much this story about water usage is serious in Berlin: this city got 600mm of rainfall, spread-out evenly around the year. The region  is forest and lakes. I think a lot of people misunderstand the probably likely need for upgrade of the local water supply for the factory (as the factory was built in a rural  area) with the fact it threatens water reserves in the region, which seems a presposterous claim for me.

There is slighty  more rainfall than in Sanfrancisco, and much more than in Nevada, where water usage from other Tesla factories was never front page news. Also, we have a lot of car factories in Spain here in Europe, and I never heard water usage was a big issue. Generally, agriculture is the biggest usage of water, and other usages are second order.

post,1cvelzm,,"As Tesla layoffs continue, here are 600 jobs the company cut in California ","As part of Tesla’s massive restructuring, the electric-vehicle maker notified the California Employment Development Department this week that it’s cutting approximately 600 more employees at its manufacturing facilities and engineering offices between Fremont and Palo Alto.

The latest round of layoffs eliminated roles across the board — from entry-level positions to directors — and hit an array of departments, impacting factory workers, software developers and robotics engineers.

The cuts were reported in a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, Act filing that CNBC obtained through a public records request.

Facing both weakening demand for Tesla electric vehicles and increased competition, the company has been slashing its headcount since at least January. CEO Elon Musk told employees in a memo in April that the company would cut more than 10% of its global workforce, which totaled 140,473 employees at the end of 2023.

Previous filings revealed that Tesla would cut more than 6,300 jobs across California; Austin, Texas; and Buffalo, New York.

Musk said on Tesla’s quarterly earnings call on April 23 that the company had built up a 25% to 30% “inefficiency” over the past several years, implying the layoffs underway could impact tens of thousands more employees than the 10% number would suggest.

According to the WARN filing, the 378 job cuts in Fremont, home to Tesla’s first U.S. manufacturing plant, included people involved in staffing and running vehicle assembly. There were 65 cuts at the company’s Kato Rd. battery development center.

Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Among the highest-level roles eliminated in Fremont were two environmental health and safety directors, and a user experience design director.

In Palo Alto, home to the company’s engineering headquarters, 233 more employees, including two directors of technical programs, lost their jobs.",4146,True,1716088231.0,2024-05-19 05:10:31,213,73,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cvelzm/as_tesla_layoffs_continue_here_are_600_jobs_the/,True,0.87,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

In a video shared with WIRED, researchers at the Beijing-based automotive cybersecurity firm GoGoByte demonstrated that they could carry out a relay attack against the latest Tesla Model 3 despite its upgrade to an ultra-wideband keyless entry system, instantly unlocking it with less than a hundred dollars worth of radio equipment. Since the Tesla 3's keyless entry system also controls the car's immobilizer feature designed to prevent its theft, that means a radio hacker could start the car and drive it away in seconds—unless the driver has enabled Tesla's optional, off-by-default PIN-to-drive feature that requires the owner to enter a four-digit code before starting the car.

post,1d7wmef,,Elon Musk ordered Nvidia to ship AI chips reserved for Tesla to X and xAI ,"Elon Musk claims he can grow Tesla into “a leader in AI & robotics,” an ambition that he’s said will require a lot of pricey processors from Nvidia to build up its infrastructure.

On Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call in April, Musk said the electric vehicle company will increase the number of active H100s — Nvidia’s flagship artificial intelligence chip — from 35,000 to 85,000 by the end of this year. He also wrote in a post on X a few days later that Tesla would spend $10 billion this year “in combined training and inference AI.”

But emails written by Nvidia senior staff and widely shared inside the company suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla’s procurement to shareholders. Correspondence from Nvidia staffers also indicates that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter.

By ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla, Musk pushed back the automaker’s receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.

“Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,” an Nvidia memo from December said. “In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.”

A more recent Nvidia email, from late April, said Musk’s comment on the first-quarter Tesla call “conflicts with bookings” and that his April post on X about $10 billion in AI spending also “conflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts.” The email referenced news about Tesla’s ongoing, drastic layoffs and warned that headcount reductions could cause further delays with an “H100 project” at Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory.",10038,True,1717506180.0,2024-06-04 15:03:00,576,219,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1d7wmef/elon_musk_ordered_nvidia_to_ship_ai_chips/,True,0.91,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

---------------------

@elonmusk has been the key driver of AI and autonomy at Tesla. He has always pushed us to achieve great things, even when such ideas were seemingly impossible at the time. Some examples:

Back in 2014, Autopilot started on a ridiculously tiny computer that only had ~384 KB of memory and puny compute (didn't even have native floating point arithmetic). He asked the engineering team to implement lane keeping, lane changing, longitudinal control for vehicles, curvature, etc. Many, even in the team, thought that the request was crazy. Nonetheless, he never gave up and pushed the team to achieve this very difficult goal. In 2015, beyond all odds, Tesla shipped the world's first Autopilot system. The second closest such product only came to market many years later.

In 2016, Tesla started doing all of the computer vision required for Autopilot in-house instead of depending on external vendors. Many people thought it was insane to bet the product on developing the vision system from scratch within a few months, which had taken other companies a decade or more. Yet, we achieved this target within eleven months. This was a strategically important move that started the development of a strong AI team at Tesla.

Not only did he push for strong AI software, but also for powerful AI hardware.

post,1dbxr1q,,Voted my shares. Sort of. Now confused and conflicted.,"I recently attempted to vote my shares.  But for whatever reason, I could only vote the small amount I had in a separate brokerage account. And even then, it only recorded half of those as being voted! (I’ve owned them for years.. haven’t done any TSLA buy/sell this year). I felt a bit disenfranchised. I have more than 10x those shares held in a Roth IRA brokerage account, and still can’t figure out how to vote those, either. This annoyed  me at first, but after thinking about it, I just voted the way the board voted anyway so what was the point of even voting?   It seems to makes little sense for me to spend an hour trying to sort this out, when I’m voting with the board anyway.

Why did Tesla run a vote your shares drawing, when NOT voting would actually allow those shares to vote with the board?

Why did they do a contest? Is winning a factory tour like getting some sort of participation medal?   The more I think about it the more confused I am.  Unless this is just to set up another action in the future if the compensation is voted down maybe? “See? individual retail investors voted in record numbers for it!” I feel like I’m missing something and I just don’t understand.

post,1dfg8h3,,Musk says robots could make Tesla $25 trillion company — more than half value of S&P 500 ,"The entire value of the S&P 500 currently stands at $45.5 trillion, according to FactSet. Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed on Thursday that his company’s Optimus humanoid robots could eventually make the automaker worth more than half of that.

Musk, who characterized himself as “pathologically optimistic” at the 2024 annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas, said Tesla is embarking on not just a “new chapter” in its life, but is about to write an entirely “new book.” Optimus appears to be one of the main characters.

Tesla first revealed its plans to work on humanoid robots in 2021 at an AI Day event, trotting out a dancer in a unitard that looked like a sleek, androgynous robot.

In January, Tesla showed off Optimus robots folding laundry in a demo video that was immediately criticized by robotics engineers for being deceptive. The robots were not autonomous, but were rather being operated with humans at the controls.

At the shareholder event on Thursday, Musk didn’t divulge exactly what Optimus can do today. He suggested the robots some day will perform like R2-D2 and C-3PO in Star Wars. They could cook or clean for you, do factory work, or even teach your children, Musk suggested.

As for shareholder value, Musk said Optimus could be the catalyst for lifting Tesla’s market cap to $25 trillion someday.

Speaking to a crowd consisting mostly of fawning fanboys in an auditorium at the Gigafactory, Musk promised Tesla would move into “limited production” of Optimus in 2025 and test out humanoid robots in its own factories next year.

The company, he predicted, will have “over 1,000, or a few thousand, Optimus robots working at Tesla” in 2025.

This is all far-out stuff even for Musk, who is notorious for making ambitious promises to investors and customers that don’t pan out — from developing software that can turn an existing Tesla into a self-driving vehicle with an upload, to EV battery swapping stations.",4924,True,1718331774.0,2024-06-14 04:22:54,533,451,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dfg8h3/musk_says_robots_could_make_tesla_25_trillion/,True,0.73,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1dk68we,,Dell and Partners Join Forces to Build AI Factory for Elon Musk's xAI,"Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer are collaborating to provide server racks for a supercomputer being developed by Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI. This supercomputer will power the next version of xAI's generative AI chatbot, Grok, and is expected to be operational by fall 2025.

# Key Takeaways

* Dell and Super Micro Computer are providing server racks for xAI's supercomputer.
* The supercomputer will power the next version of xAI's AI chatbot, Grok.
* The project is expected to be completed by fall 2025.
* The collaboration involves Nvidia's advanced AI GPUs.

# Dell and Super Micro's Role

Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer are key players in the development of xAI's supercomputer. Dell is responsible for assembling half of the server racks, while Super Micro, known for its liquid-cooling technology and strong ties with chip firms like Nvidia, will handle the other half. This collaboration was confirmed by Elon Musk on the social media platform X.

# Nvidia's Contribution

Nvidia is providing the advanced AI GPUs required for the project. The training of AI models like Grok requires tens of thousands of power-hungry chips. For instance, training the Grok 2 model took about 20,000 Nvidia H100 graphic processing units (GPUs), and future models will require even more. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, emphasized the importance of this collaboration in expanding the reach of AI technology.

# The AI Factory

Dell CEO Michael Dell announced that the company is building an ""AI factory"" with Nvidia to power Grok. This AI factory will be a comprehensive infrastructure, including CPUs, GPUs, networking switches, software systems, and storage, all connected by miles of cables. The factory aims to make it easier for a broader range of customers to establish their own AI factories.

# Future Prospects

Elon Musk has ambitious plans for xAI. The supercomputer, termed the ""Gigafactory of Compute,"" is expected to be operational by fall 2025.",3900,True,1718870395.0,2024-06-20 09:59:55,39,12,Write_Code_Sport,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dk68we/dell_and_partners_join_forces_to_build_ai_factory/,True,0.76,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

But the issue raises concerns about why there isn’t an easy way to open the car from the outside when its 12-volt battery — the one that powers things like its door locks and windows — loses power.
>
>The car’s owner, Renee Sanchez, was taking her granddaughter to the zoo, but after loading the child in the Model Y, she closed the door and wasn’t able to open it again. “My phone key wouldn’t open it,” Sanchez said in an interview with Arizona’s Family. “My car key wouldn’t open it.” She called emergency services, and firefighters were dispatched to help.

>It is possible to open doors in a Model Y if you’re inside the vehicle when it has no power; there’s a latch to open a front door and a cable to open a back door. But that wasn’t an option for the young child, who was buckled into their car seat while Sanchez was stuck outside the car. You can jump-start a dead Tesla to be able to get into it, but it can be a complex process.

I'm glad that the person had the presence of mind to call emergency services, and that there ultimately was a solution to get the toddler out of the vehicle in the Arizona sun.

post,1dsjrlp,,Replicate a hand-free trunk with iOS Shortcuts and NFC tags,"*With an iPhone, Apple’s Shortcuts app, and an NFC tag, you can make pretty much any Tesla have a hands-free\* trunk by following this guide.  Scroll to the end if you are already familiar with iOS Shortcuts and want the quick setup guide.*

My 2023 Long Range Model Y unfortunately does not work with Tesla’s recent hands-free trunk feature since the Model Y lacks the UWB hardware.  However, I replicated similar behavior (within a window of time), and wanted to share how in case someone else would find it useful.  The only downside is that you need to roughly estimate how long it will take you to walk to your Tesla.  The NFC tag on the Tesla is also pretty ugly, but at the same time helps you pick out your white Tesla among the 10 others in the parking lot haha.

\* This is hands-free once you've reached your Tesla within the chosen time window, but requires you to first manually run the shortcut. This can be useful if you know you are about to head to your Tesla with your hands full and don't already have access to Siri via an Apple Watch or AirPods.

https://reddit.com/link/1dsjrlp/video/jxi7vtlvvt9d1/player

**You will need:**

* An iPhone that supports background NFC reading (iPhone XR/XS and later)
* Apple’s [Shortcuts app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334)
* NFC tags - [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPJ5DDCQ)
* A Tesla that supports opening the trunk with the Tesla app and iOS Shortcuts
* A custom shortcut I created called [Hands Free Trunk](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/29f19ada5bc444059394c7c885b38c1a)

**Detailed Setup Guide:**

*If you are already familiar with iOS shortcuts, see my quick setup guide at the bottom.*

* Stick an NFC tag onto your Tesla at a height where the top of your iPhone lines up with the tag while in your pocket.  *Note: the NFC tags I listed do not work when placed on metal.  So you will need to place the tag on a section of the Tesla that is plastic, like the bumper.",8870,True,1719806241.0,2024-07-01 05:57:21,23,19,AlfredNoldo,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1dsjrlp/replicate_a_handfree_trunk_with_ios_shortcuts_and/,True,0.73,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1dt69s1,,Looking for insight/tips/recommendations for road tripping in Texas,"Hi everyone, looking for some insight/tips while in Texas. I'll be there for a conference in Sept, looking to rent a model x there and bring my family with me. 


Conference is in San Antonio, after the conference we'll explore the area. Next day we'll go to Austin, maybe see the gigafactory and other things. Next off to Dallas and finally back down to Houston. My wife loves space, so we'll probably stop by the NASA center there. We'll drive back to SAT to drop off and fly out from there.


Any tips or recommendations for things to see/do/eat? We have a 8 1/2 month old with us, which is why I wanted to rent out the X. I currently drive a YLR. I would love to upgrade to an X as our family grows.

post,1dtlvh3,,"Tesla reports 443,956 deliveries in second quarter, a 4.8% decrease from last year ","Tesla just posted its second-quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers for 2024.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q2 2024: 443,956 vehicles

Total production Q2 2024: 410,831 vehicles

Tesla’s numbers beat Wall Street estimates. Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439,000 in the three months ending June 30, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet Street Account. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter was down 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier.

Troy Teslike, an independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans, predicted deliveries of 423,000 for the quarter.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the electric vehicle maker. Tesla groups deliveries into two categories — Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and all other vehicles — but doesn’t report numbers for individual models or specific regions.

Tesla’s current lineup includes its popular Model Y crossover utility vehicles, Model 3 sedans and the new Cybertruck pickups, as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan.

In April, Tesla reported a drop of 8.5% in first-quarter deliveries to 386,810, the first annual decline since 2020. Weeks later the company reported 13% decline in year-over-year revenue for the quarter, “primarily due to lower average selling price.”

Sluggish sales were in part the result of temporary factory shut downs initiated in response to an alleged arson attack at Tesla’s factory in Germany, as well as shipping delays following Red Sea conflicts, Tesla said.

But the sales drop also correlated with Tesla’s aging lineup of vehicles, increased competition from other EV makers especially in China, and brand erosion that one recent survey attributed partly to CEO Elon Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.”

Tesla shares are down 16% in 2024 even after rallying 6% on Monday.

post,1dulktf,,Tesla Set for a New Bull Run as Deliveries Turn Around and Energy Storage Powers the AI Era,"Whenever investors are disappointed with Tesla, Elon Musk surprises short sellers with a big move. On Tuesday, Tesla posted stronger-than-expected Q2 deliveries, hinting at a turning point for weak demand, with an upside in Q3 deliveries. Additionally, energy storage deployments doubled quarter-over-quarter, potentially helping to meet the vast electricity demand that comes with AI. These factors are enough to bring in a substantial influx of Tesla bulls.

Thanks to these developments, Tesla surged over 10% on Tuesday, with its market value reaching $737.5 billion, maintaining a six-day rally, and breaking another resistance level, which is always a bullish sign. From April's low, Tesla shares are now up 67%.

**Q2 Deliveries Slightly Exceed Expectations Amid Record June Deliveries from Chinese EV Makers, Zero-Interest Car Purchases Expected to Drive Crazy Q3 Demand**

According to Tesla's delivery data released on Tuesday, the company delivered 440,000 new vehicles in Q2, down 4.8% year-over-year but up 15% quarter-over-quarter, and better than the market's expectation of 439,300 vehicles. The total production in Q2 was about 411,000 cars, resulting in a delivery-production gap of 33,000 cars, compared to -46,000 cars in the previous quarter (where more cars were produced, leading to some inventory remaining). Tesla noted that sales in the second quarter were affected by the temporary shutdown of German factories and the Red Sea conflict, which also means there is upward potential on the demand side or perhaps short-term supply struggles to meet demand, which is obviously more exciting than excess supply.

Considering that Chinese EV makers such as NIO, ZEEKR, and Leapmotor have all reported record deliveries in June, this implies a significant recovery in demand for Tesla. The company also launched a major campaign on Monday, introducing five-year zero interest financing for Model 3/Y and other preferential policies.",3784,True,1720031433.0,2024-07-03 20:30:33,0,7,BobbyFuckkingAxelrod,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1dulktf/tesla_set_for_a_new_bull_run_as_deliveries_turn/,True,0.22,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1e16r7e,,My view on the language model value chain.,"Hi, I am a founder who is trying to build ""Google for Financial Research"" start out from equity research.

  
Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :)

  
### Value Chain



First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. 

- Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything.

- Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything.

- Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything.

  
### Past

  
Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. 

  
OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong.

  
### Present

  
Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this.",3454,True,1720752169.0,2024-07-12 04:42:49,0,7,beerbellyman4vr,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1e16r7e/my_view_on_the_language_model_value_chain/,True,0.23,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

• Tesla Model Y was the best-selling imported car in South Korea in the first half of the year with 10,041 units sold, surpassing popular luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW.

• Model Y sales growth was 395.4% compared to the same period last year, marking the first time a model other than Mercedes-Benz and BMW took first place in half-year sales in South Korea.

• Tesla ranked as the third best-selling imported car brand in South Korea for the first time, with total sales of 17,380 units, challenging the dominance of Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, and Volkswagen.

comment,1e9gs24,1e9gs24,,"The gist of his thoughts on the Model Y:

>Tesla Model 3 and Model Y are highly compelling, great products, but they don’t have a lot of competition. The products that are trying to compete with them more often than not, without being specific, have unfortunately replicated the package, the shape, the overall proportion of the vehicle, such that they’re not a Tesla-branded vehicle, but the side view centerline of the vehicle is almost identical to a Model Y. The seating package is within millimeters of a Model Y, the performance is slightly worse than a Model Y.

>Ironically, because of the Model Y’s success, you have a lot of incumbents that have built products that look and feel and are shaped a lot like a Model Y. That’s very different from the internal combustion space where you have hundreds of choices, lots of brands, lots of variety of form factors. What we’ve witnessed over the last few years is because of lack of choice, we’ve had a lot of customers that have gone to one single brand and have had to have a lot of elasticity of their form factor desires. So maybe they wanted a true SUV and got a very car-like crossover with the Model Y. Maybe they wanted something that was a little bit bigger, but they got something that was more like the Model Y.

comment,15n1sl5,15n1sl5,,"Hello, fellow car enthusiasts,

After over a year (since March 2023) and approximately 16,000 kilometers (10,000 miles) of driving my Mercedes EQS 580, I feel compelled to share my experiences and some unexpected insights. For full disclosure, I opted for nearly all available upgrades except for the heated windshield and the silk-like interior roof lining, which seemed superfluous for my needs. I even splurged on a pink gold-plated key to almost max out the options.

Despite agreeing with many observations already noted in this subreddit, I’d like to offer some detailed perspectives on the everyday use of the EQS and how it compares to its competitors.

**Initial Considerations and Competitors:**  
Initially, my heart was set on acquiring either a Porsche Taycan 4S or an Audi E-tron GT RS. My plan was to test the EQS merely to confirm my disinterest, ensuring I had considered all viable options fairly. The Porsche Taycan 4S, despite its allure, fell short during a test drive due to its cramped interior and less responsive touch screens, prompting me to return it prematurely. The Audi e-Tron GT RS was next, offering an exhilarating two-day drive that showcased its impressive power and handling. However, its limited range and the irresistible urge to floor the pedal made it impractical for daily commutes, leading to unwelcome attention from law enforcement.

**Why EQS Stood Out:**  
Surprisingly, the EQS 580 proved to be an underdog.",3950,True,1721907145.0,2024-07-25 13:32:25,5,0,Ok-Driver-9791,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/15n1sl5/my_eqs_sedan_long_term_review/leusz9u/,True,,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,leusz9u

post,1egx51l,,Qualcomm beats estimates and phone chip sales are up 12% ,"Qualcomm reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations, particularly for sales, and provided strong guidance for the current quarter.

Qualcomm stock rose over 4% in extended trading.

Here’s how Qualcomm did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending in June 23:

Earnings per share: $2.33, adjusted versus $2.25 expected

Revenue: $9.39 billion, adjusted, versus $9.22 billion expected

Net income during the quarter was $2.13 billion, or $1.88 per share, versus $1.8 billion, or $1.60 per share in the year-ago period.

Qualcomm said it expected between $9.5 billion and $10.3 billion in sales in the current quarter, compared to Wall Street expectations of $9.71 billion. Analysts were looking for earnings guidance of $2.45, versus the company’s forecast of between $2.38 and $2.58.

Qualcomm’s biggest and most important business is processors and modems for smartphones, which it calls its handsets business. The summer months are traditionally a slower part of the annual cycle for smartphones, because most new models launch in the fall.

Handset sales rose 12% on a year-over-year basis to $5.9 billion in revenue, in line with analyst estimates from StreetAccount, which suggests that a deep slump in smartphone sales over the past two years is abating. Qualcomm is also framing its most advanced Snapdragon chips as necessary for “AI smartphones,” such as recent Samsung models, which can run some generative AI tasks like creating images.

Automotive chips remains small for Qualcomm but the company sees placing more software and semiconductors into cars as one of its strongest opportunities for growth and diversification. Automotive revenues rose 87% on an annual basis to $811 million. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were looking for $641.7 million.

The company sells chips for lower-cost devices as well as Meta’s Quest headsets in a business it calls “Internet of Things.",2938,True,1722456843.0,2024-07-31 22:14:03,179,31,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1egx51l/qualcomm_beats_estimates_and_phone_chip_sales_are/,True,0.98,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1elozjp,,Lucid gearing up for the upcoming Gravity SUV with additional $1.5B investment from PIF,"* PIF affiliate will buy $750 million of convertible preferred stock via private placement and provide for a $750 million unsecured delayed draw term loan facility.
* Lucid now has enough capital to last until the fourth quarter of 2025
* PIF has over 60% stake of Lucid shares and probably would not let Lucid go without a fight.  I suspect that PIF may even privatized Lucid if things go sour.
* This Gravity SUV is expected to rival Tesla’s Model X SUV in the market, and is expected to enter production in late 2024.

Here is some info about the Lucid Gravity SUV:

Awesome looking Lucid Gravity SUV with estimated range of 440 miles and ""under $80,000""

The gravity uses ""the next generation of Lucid's proprietary, ultra-compact powertrain technology"".

Fast charging speeds with the 900-volt architecture likely as high as the Air's 300kW.

0 to 60mph in less than 3.5 seconds.

440 miles estimated range is over 100 mile more than Tesla's longest range Model X.

Clamshell design hatch with practically identical roofline like the Air's

Incredibly aerodynamic with drag coefficient of 0.24

Lots of interior space with three rows for seven-passenger.

Improved interface with a 34-inch curved display and a large secondary screen below.

Expect to be on sale by late 2024.

comment,1es46sj,1es46sj,,"From the article: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Office of Defects Investigation has closed a four-year probe into suspension failures affecting some Teslas. The problem is better known among the Tesla enthusiast community as the ""whompy wheel"" problem, and NHTSA's ODI found hundreds of separate incidents of front suspension failures affecting both Model S sedans and Model X SUVs.

Although the automaker had previously issued a service bulletin to replace the faulty components on some cars, NHTSA says many more vehicles are fitted with the bad parts, and the bulletin should be expanded.

NHTSA began its preliminary evaluation in November 2020 following 43 reports of left or right front suspension fore link failures in model year 2015–2017 Model S and 2016–2017 Model X electric vehicles. Most of these happened at low speeds while parking, and only four occurred at highway speeds.

Tesla actually issued a service bulletin in 2017 to replace the front suspension fore links in some vehicles if either the left or right fore link was damaged or if the vehicle was due for an alignment.

post,1f1ozpe,,"Canada EV Tariffs, will this impact Canadian Tesla prices/incentives? ","There may be a paywall for this article so please find it here:

Canada will impose new tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, aluminum and steel, lining up behind western allies and taking steps to protect domestic manufacturers.
The government plans to announce a 100% levy on electric cars and 25% on steel and aluminum, according to people familiar with the matter, speaking on condition they not be identified because the matter is still private. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to unveil the policy in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he’s gathered with the rest of his cabinet for a series of meetings about the economy and foreign relations.
Canada, an export-driven economy that relies heavily on trade with the US, has been closely watching moves by the Biden administration to erect a much higher tariff wall against Chinese EVs, batteries, solar cells, steel and other products. Canada’s auto sector is heavily integrated with that of its closest neighbor: The vast majority of its light vehicle production — which was 1.5 million units last year — is exported to the US.
Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, the most powerful person in Trudeau’s cabinet, has been one of the most prominent voices in favor of a harder approach to Chinese vehicle exports, and becoming a closer trade ally with the US.

In June, she announced a public consultation on possible measures to make it more difficult for Chinese companies to sell electric vehicles in the Canadian market. The auto industry, she said, is “facing unfair competition from China’s intentional, state-directed policy of overcapacity that is undermining Canada’s EV sector’s ability to compete.”

post,1f7513x,,BYD sales hit a record in August despite broader China EV slowdown ,"Chinese electric car giant BYD sold a record number of passenger vehicles in August, with sales of hybrids growing faster than those of battery-only cars.

The company said August sales rose by 30% year-on-year to 370,854 passenger cars.

Its sales of battery-only cars rose by nearly 12%, while hybrid-powered vehicle sales surged by 48% to account for just under two-thirds of BYD cars sold last month.

In contrast, several new energy vehicle startups saw a dip in deliveries last month.

Li Auto, best known for its range-extender vehicles, reported 48,122 deliveries in August, down from a record 51,000 in July.

Aito, which uses Huawei technology, said it delivered 31,216 cars last month, down by more than 10,000 vehicles from the prior month. Huawei is selling the Aito trademark and patents to automaker Seres for 2.5 billion yuan ($352.5 million).

Lower-priced cars hitting the market

Nio said it delivered 20,176 cars in August, down slightly from July but above 20,000 for a fourth-straight month.

The company’s lower-priced brand Onvo opened 105 stores on Sunday as it prepares to begin for deliveries for its first car, the L60 SUV, this month. Nio is scheduled to report earnings on Friday.

Xpeng reported 14,036 car deliveries in August, its best month for the year so far.

The company said on Friday it began some deliveries of its newly launched, mass market Mona M03 electric car that sells for the equivalent of less than $20,000 in China. It was not clear whether those M03 deliveries were included in the total figure Xpeng reported.

Geely-backed Zeekr reported a month-on-month increase to 18,015 deliveries in August, but that was down from 20,206 deliveries in June.

Undercutting Tesla and going global

Zeekr on Friday said it would launch its first SUV this month with a price more than $1,400 lower than Tesla’s Model Y.

post,1f785wr,,Thoughts on skill-based hiring,"What’s your take on the latest hiring trend that’s picking up steam with companies like Google, IBM, Tesla, and even the White House?  

I’ve got mixed feelings. On one hand, dropping the degree requirement opens the talent pool, which is great for filling skill gaps fast. But there are some concerns. Passing a technical test doesn’t always mean someone is ready to handle the complexities of managing digital infrastructure or securing user data. 

We should take a moment to think about what a degree actually represents. It’s not just about having technical skills; it also shows that someone can commit to long-term goals, tackle complex tasks, work well in teams, and bring critical thinking, problem-solving, and leadership skills to the table. 

Skill-based hiring might be a great fit for entry-level roles or hands-on jobs, but for more complex projects, I think it’s still important to consider academic background. A balanced approach seems ideal—one that combines technical assessments with evaluations of soft skills and how someone might perform under pressure in real-world situations. 

What do you all think? Is skill-based hiring the future, or do we still need to value the traditional routes? ",1215,False,1725287438.0,2024-09-02 16:30:38,2,6,NickBaca-Storni,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1f785wr/thoughts_on_skillbased_hiring/,True,0.75,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1fcyze8,,How To Get Money For A Business,"I've seen a lot of posts about people wanting money to start or grow a business but not knowing how.

These are some of the easiest ways to get money to start a business:

1. **Presales.** Preselling subscriptions or even physical products will allow you to fund your business for $0 upfront. Tesla used presales on the Cybertruck to get a free $25 million dollar loan from their customers. You can do the same thing on a smaller scale.
2. **Business credit.** If you have a 700 credit score and an LLC that's at least 3 months old, you can $100k+ in business credit. Right now there are certain credit products that literally offer 0% interest for the first 12-18 months. 
3. **Friends and family.** If you truly have a compelling idea, raising money from friends and family is a viable option most people are afraid of. This one does come with some drawbacks (especially if you fail) but it can also provide strong motivation not to fail
4. **SBA loans.** These can be a little tough to get and typically take at least 3 months to close, but they can have incredibly good interest rates if you get approved.
5. **Seller finance.** If you're buying an existing business, many businesses will offer some form of seller finance simply to get the deal done. 
6. **Crowdfunding.** Using crowdfunding platforms can be a great way to fund a new business or get money for an existing business without the direct pressure of asking friends and family. It does require some marketing skills to get any real traction though. 
7. **Venture Capital / Angel Investors.** There are several platforms that will allow you to raise money through VC or angel investors. 

There are plenty of reasons not to start or grow a business but don't let lack of funding be one of them. 

Many businesses struggle or fail simply because the business owners don't know there are so many options out there.

post,1fqk8k6,,'Safety Disaster:' Tesla FSD 'Galaxies Away From Being Anywhere Close To Competition',"* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.
* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.

  
With just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company’s self-driving technology.



**What Happened**: Tesla’s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a “safety disaster” and “galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,” said GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla’s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.’s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.’s GM Cruise.



With Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.’s BIDU Apollo Go.



Johnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla’s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is “suspect.” In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. “In fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,” it said.



While the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. “The most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,” it added.



Johnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.",3338,True,1727431479.0,2024-09-27 12:04:39,264,176,NeighborhoodOld7075,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fqk8k6/safety_disaster_tesla_fsd_galaxies_away_from/,True,0.79,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

Rather, there are, in some cases, terms that limit sale of the vehicle for a number of years that, if violated, could result in a lawsuit. 

John Cena fell afoul of this when he signed an agreement to purchase a Ford GT Supercar, then sold it for millions a few months later...which is exactly what these clauses are supposed to prevent. The contract he signed stipulated a minimum ownership of two years, so he got in trouble. 

Not that anyone is making any money off of reselling a *Cybertruck*. 

The clause is basically anti-scalping for rare and coveted vehicles that actually could make tons off of being resold. 

For Cybertrucks, the stipulation is a single year.

I am also in the SF Bay Area, so its usually not too warm and I am not blasting the AC (except this past week because of the heat wave haha).

The range will suffer if you are in a colder climate, a very hot climate, or you drive over 80 mph because of drag. I think if you take a 90% haircut of the EPA range then you should get roughly \~320 miles per fillup. However people have tested this model and gotten around 370 miles as well if you drive around 70 mph on the highway and keep the climate around 68 or so.",806,False,1728404677.0,2024-10-08 18:24:37,64,0,nhlducks35,cars,https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1fyyqdr/test_drove_10_evs_at_a_local_event_my_thoughts_on/lqyl5o4/,True,,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,lqyl5o4

Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress","Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla’s Cybercab concept vehicle — a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals — on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have “unsupervised FSD” up and running in Texas and California next year in the company’s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla’s premium driver assistance system, available today in a “supervised” version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

“As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

“Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.",3313,True,1728649167.0,2024-10-11 14:19:27,1702,563,thelastsubject123,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g18fon/tesla_shares_drop_6_in_premarket_after_cybercab/,True,0.93,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1g1e9q0,,Tesla is Completely out of Touch with Needs of Taxi Services. ,"Seeing a lot of focus on the Temu Boston Dynamics bot, but not a lot of discussion on the robo taxi. 

How this thing is built tells me how out of touch and unprepared Tesla is to seriously compete in ride servicing. 

First off this thing has two seats, that alone is such a dumb design decision. It had to be Elon that said to keep it as two seats so it looks futuristic and aesthetic. What if I want to travel with a small group of people? I’m not using the LAX shuttle van at that point, I’m immediately turning to a competitor. Haven’t really seen anyone comment on how out of touch and unnecessary that was. 

One other concern I have is how Tesla primarily uses cameras. What if there are sirens and a fire truck, ambulance, or police car is blowing through an intersection. Other autonomous vehicles incorporate sound, I’m not too sure Tesla does. If not it sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. 

Beyond this there’s the ridiculous price tag he put on it which it’ll probably be nowhere close to. 

What are other people’s thoughts on this, did anything with this Robotaxi actually look like a feasible product to you? It looks like an aesthetic toy, but not an actual product that can compete in the space. Based on my understanding of a typical car design cycle, redesigning this to add four instead of just 2 seats would take probably another 2-4 years at least. To me it seems like they really just showed they lost on their biggest bet in the near future. 


Edit: Alright read through the comments, and still think the 2 seat no steering wheel design is stupid. People are saying this is meant to also be a personal commuter car. So my choices are to buy a 30K Robotaxi (knowing Tesla’s history this WILL be priced higher) and then ALSO get a model 3 or model Y to drive around my family for ANOTHER 40K when I can just get ONE model 3 or any other self driving car, no Robotaxi and do everything I need?",3228,True,1728665139.0,2024-10-11 18:45:39,774,430,YungPersian,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g1e9q0/tesla_is_completely_out_of_touch_with_needs_of/,True,0.8,2024,both,search,False,False,0,
comment,1g1e9q0,1g1e9q0,,"To me the real challenges are both legal and operational. So for fun, let's assume all Elon's claims come true. 20-30k in 2026 with FSD without lidar (just for the sake of argument).

Nobody has clearance to run fully autonomous cars on the road. There are some companies who have some clearance to run some cars and they are reporting back good data. But that's all based on lidar systems, not just camera based. The roll out will have to take this in consideration and this is not a technological step but a governance one. This will take considerable time.

Beyond that, these cars will need charging, which might be inductive sure but that still needs infrastructure which needs to be built out. Since there is no single station built anywhere.

Then you have to think about the hygiene within the car, both in terms of actual hygiene, but also gravity and misuse by the public. This will need operational staff too. 

This is where the waymo roll out is a lot more sensible, especially the partnership with a company like Uber who does have infrastructure and operational staff in most mayor cities or the capacity to scale.

And even if you were to fix all of those issues you'd also be activating a lot of latent demand for mobility, there is a reason you need a license to run a taxi in NYC otherwise it would be even more gridlocked than it is today.

While 3 dB is a huge improvement in cabin noise (decibel is logarithmic, not linear), it's actually surprising how loud the Mercedes is. My i4 got 64dB from the [same C&D test](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a40743000/2022-bmw-i4-edrive40-by-the-numbers/), and the BMW iX got [63 dB](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a39983612/2022-bmw-ix-tested-interior-sound-highway-range/).

75mph with 300 miles+ range is seriously impressive for this segment. My old Model 3 could barely hit 250 under the same condition. This in combination with the Supercharger network would make a lot of long distance trips much more viable than with other EVs.

* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.
* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.
* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.

post,1g8jv19,,EV Rental in Spain  1X1 BMW,"Rented a mid-level BMW 1X1 in Barcelona Spain for two days for drive to small town 150km away.

The cars range is about 250 miles at 100% derating the WLPT rating to EPA.  Still hot in Spain so AC all the way.

The IX1 is a great car.  It had heads up display.  Its great when integrated with NAV and cruise control and has  become a must have feature.  Quiet, comfortable.   Regular car acceleration but that will help with range.

Charging in Spain turned out to be excellent.  Every large gas station had a couple chargers.    Typically just 50kW.  Might take extra time but that's about it.   Availability is all important. Even at 6AM I was able to get one to work from scratch, using the QR to get the app and using that for topping off for the trip after using the car the previous day.   That was the only time I needed on the road fast charging.  The town had two free L2 charges and plugged into one for the day. The Tesla S on the other charger was there when I got there and there when I left five hours later.

Parking garage in center of Barcelona had 20 chargers.  8 were just for Sixt, the car rental company, the others for the public.  When we were in the garage, always some public chargers available.  Parking garage for the car two blocks from our apartment had 2 x L2 which we used two nights.  That was super convenient having 100% charge.

Tesla chargers were available but we never got to try them out.  I have a Model 3 so ""Add your EV"" in the Tesla app was easy and it hten provide directions, maps, availability to use them.

The BMW nav app had a ""Go to charger feature"" which was good. It also had a nice feature of ""Start Preconditioning"" so could turn that on so you could charge faster.

Overall, renting an EV in Spain was easy with enough chargers to quell any range anxiety.",1810,False,1729494780.0,2024-10-21 09:13:00,8,3,EaglesPDX,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1g8jv19/ev_rental_in_spain_1x1_bmw/,True,0.9,2024,both,search,False,False,0,
post,1gak7c4,,Tesla shares jump 6% on profit beat,"* Tesla reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts’ estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected

Revenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.

Tesla’s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.

Automotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.

Operating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.

Tesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023.

That being said, its not that far off the rivian or lightning when equivalently specced, (IMO) feels more fun to drive than either, (IMO) looks cooler than either, and has the convenience/tech/packaging you’d expect from tesla

Especially with the current prices & recalls and whatnot, I wouldn’t want to buy one, but it’s not hard to see why it sells and if it were cheaper I’d be interested.

I also think car purchases are often irrational, especially as you go up in price, for enthusiasts e.g. an emira over a c8 z51, and that plays in favor of the cybertruck

post,1gbcgse,,Tesla stock has best day in over a decade on Musk's 2025 growth projection,"Tesla shares soared 22% to close at $260.48 on Thursday, the stock’s best day since 2013, following the company’s better-than-expected earnings report.

The company late Wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which came in just under analysts’ expectations of $25.37 billion, but was up 8% compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.

“We expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in Tesla shares Thursday, given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note.

Tesla’s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a “potentially unsustainable driver” of earnings and cash flow.

Automakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year, and if they can’t meet the target, they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles.

Tesla earnings also got a boost from FSD, the company’s Full Self-Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called “Actually Smart Summon.”

CEO Elon Musk said on the call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.

Even bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk’s forecast and wrote, in a note following the earnings report, “Our view remains more reserved at 10-15% (~2.03m),” and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30,000 after subsidies, and other variants of the small SUV.",4112,True,1729801558.0,2024-10-24 22:25:58,558,381,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gbcgse/tesla_stock_has_best_day_in_over_a_decade_on/,True,0.8,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

\- dimensions and interior/boot space  
\- motor performance & torque  
\- efficiency of \~ 12 kw/100km in ideal circumstances  
\- better ride and dynamic handling  
\- better infotainment system  
\- most importantly a better LFP [battery](https://carnewschina.com/2024/06/28/geelys-aegis-short-blade-lfp-battery-full-details-including-extreme-safety/) than BYD Gen 1 blade battery. It has a higher energy density, more charge cycles, faster charging, and with more [extensive](https://youtu.be/Xme91gRHV24?si=x9wcZ6qGe1714wW_) safety tests.

Do you expect it to be a hit like the Atto 3?

In China Geely's cars never made it to the top 10 of best selling cars like several of BYD EV's, including the Atto 3. On the other hand the E5 is right now at no 10 on the list of [hot cars](https://www.dongchedi.com/sales/hot-energy_1-x-x-x-x), while Atto 3 \[Yuan Plus\] is at no 14.

post,1gh1z43,,Need help regarding intrinsic value ,"So the stock in question is Tesla.

I have done lots of research into the company and it’s finances and have used multiple methods in order to determine an intrinsic value (including margin of safety) to find a nice entry price. The methods I have used are:

1) Discounted cash flow ($50.49)
2) Multiples valuation model ($31.81)
3) Graham’s valuation model ($179.41)

This is not to say that my valuations are correct by any means, and I accept there could be faults in my calculations. My concern is that Grahams valuation model has produced the highest IV by some margin. However, it seems quite reasonable given how Tesla stock has traded over the last few years that this could be fairly accurate. I just want some advice on how people would use these numbers. Would you:

Tesla also ties for second place at 70% with the Model 3 Performance and Model Ys, alongside a good chunk of Honda’s other vehicles.

post,1gjd018,,"Boeing: Navigating Challenges, Securing Growth—A Resilient Investment Opportunity in Aerospace","**Boeing as a Potential Investment Opportunity**

Boeing stands as one of the most important players in the aerospace industry, with a heavily established brand and legacy that commands trust around the world. Despite recent operational and financial challenges affecting its stock price, Boeing’s intrinsic value and reputation position it as a viable investment. While relatively short-term setbacks have impacted shareholder sentiment, these issues are likely irrelevant in terms of Boeing’s long-term prospects as a leader in aviation. For a company of Boeing’s stature, resilience and success are inevitable, making it a viable investment opportunity amidst doubt in the markets.

**Boeing’s Brand Strength and Market Perception**

Since its founding in 1916, Boeing has had a long-standing reputation for safety and reliability. The company has bolstered its reputation through engineering marvels like the Boeing 747. Although Boeing has recently had many notable incidents, they have focused on being transparent and open with its shareholders. For example, production issues with the 787 Dreamliner, delays in the 777X program, software glitches affecting 737 MAX deliveries, supply chain disruptions, and quality control concerns have been openly handled by the company as they have been in direct communication with the National Transportation Safety Board in order to improve and learn from their mistakes. Another key factor is brand loyalty. Boeing’s brand strength is comparable to companies such as Coca-Cola and Apple. This loyalty and strength has been based on customer trust, market stability, innovation, and collaboration. Ultimately, Boeing’s long-standing reputation allows it to build strong brand loyalty, further bolstering its position in the aerospace industry and ensuring its continued relevance and resilience in the market. 

Boeing has a huge brand name that involves years of experience in the market, which competitors like COMAC and others lack.",9335,True,1730723185.0,2024-11-04 13:26:25,0,3,Goatofoptions,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gjd018/boeing_navigating_challenges_securing_growtha/,True,0.33,2024,elon,search,False,False,0,

Now in the Volvo it's amazing to drive but soooo fucking annoying to interface with. The remote has no buttons and sometimes keyless entry doesn't work and the trunk doesn't have a kick sensor and there's a RFID sensor (tesla like) only on the driver's side door. 

The steering wheel has no Mute or Answer Call buttons. The Volume UP button also works as an OK key so if you have anything on the screen that needs confirmation you can't turn the volume down until you OK / Volume up the notification.

There some many dumb choices like this (some fixable by software, some not) but 99% of the EX30 usability problems could have been solved with a better steering wheel (and a HUD).

*When Reuters reported in April that Tesla had scrapped plans for a long-promised, next-generation $25,000 electric vehicle, the automaker’s stock plunged. Chief Executive Elon Musk rushed to respond on X, his social-media network.*  
*“Reuters is lying,” he posted, without elaborating. Tesla’s stock recovered some of its losses.*  
*Six months later, Musk appears to have backed into an admission that Tesla dropped its plans for a human-driven $25,000 car. He said in an Oct. 23 earnings call that building the affordable EV would be ""pointless” unless the car was fully autonomous.*  
*His latest remarks came in response to an investor asking: “When can we expect Tesla to give us the $25,000 non-robotaxi regular car model?”*  
*Musk responded: “We’re not making a non-robo…,” before he was interrupted by another Tesla executive. Musk later added: “Basically, I think having a regular $25K model is pointless. It would be silly.”*  
*The April 5 Reuters article reported that Tesla had abandoned plans for an all-new, affordable mass-market EV but still planned a self-driving robotaxi. Since then, Musk has increasingly touted plans for robotaxis and autonomous vehicles.*  
*Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment for this story.*  
*On the October earnings call, Musk said that Tesla does plan a “$25K car” – its “Cybercab,” a two-door, two-seat, fully autonomous vehicle.

comment,1gmp923,1gmp923,,"The most common cause is that with EVs your inputs need to be smoother than ICEVs. Teslas have one pedal driving, so when you remove your foot from the accelerator you get immediate braking instead of coasting like in an (automatic) petrol car. That abruptness in a Tesla or other EV causes motion sickness for a lot of people. To prevent it you have to be gradual with taking your foot off the accelerator pedal. Another reason could be pressing the pedal too abruptly so that your acceleration is uncomfortable. Again, being smoother on the pedal helps. A third reason could be the lack of drivetrain noise. Movement without sound gives some people motion sickness. It's unlikely in a Tesla because they're not well-insulated, but it happens to some people in really quiet cars.",780,False,1731260929.0,2024-11-10 18:48:49,9,0,strongmanass,cars,https://reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1gmp923/evs_and_motion_sickness/lwfyo8n/,True,,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,lwfyo8n

You could make a case that lap times don't really matter, but if we're talking about ultimate performance sedans, personally I think it does. Mostly bragging rights sure, but I still think the extra performance means something in this category of cars.

post,1gukbnc,,"Test drove a few EVs, and here are my very brief takeaways","My model Y lease is ending and I won’t be getting another one. Over the past few days I test drove the following in hopes of finding a replacement:

1. Bmw IX x drive50 - felt plenty powerful even with the base motor. Rear seat had good room. However the front seat wasn’t that comfortable given the price point, and the interior felt impressive at first, until I stepped inside the Mercedes. The ride quality, handling, sound insulation and sound system were sublime. The cargo space was surprisingly small for such a large vehicle. 

2. Mercedes EQE SUV 350 - felt downright slow compared to the IX, but more than adequate for most daily drives. Like the IX, the trunk looked smaller than the compact model Y. The exterior styling resembled a blob with a Mercedes logo. But the interior was truly a showstopper even without the hyper screen. The seats felt the most comfortable and thickly padded out of the cars I tested. 

3. Tesla Model X - terrifyingly quick, and has the familiar tesla UI. It’s also the most useful for my particular needs, which is occasional use of the third row, supercharger access for longer trips, and larger cargo area relative to the Mercedes and bmw. Honestly, the interior isn’t as bad as people say, sure it doesn’t have the ambient lighting and design details of the Germans, but it’s still a tangible upgrade over the model Y. But I didn’t care for the haptic turn signals on the steering wheel and shifting through the touchscreen as well. Ride quality is good even with the 22 inch wheels.

4. Rivian R1S dual motor - this one was the biggest surprise. Despite the positive reviews I read online, the R1S was clearly my least favorite out of this group. It had the worst ride quality regardless of which suspension setting I used, even thought I tempered my expectations since this is an off road capable vehicle.",2290,True,1731976321.0,2024-11-19 01:32:01,189,354,Crazy_Day5359,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1gukbnc/test_drove_a_few_evs_and_here_are_my_very_brief/,True,0.77,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

FINAL SUBJECTIVE TOP 5:

1: BMW iX

2: Volvo EX30

3: BMW i4

4: Ford Mustang Mach-e

5: Hyundai Ioniq 6

*REVIEWS START HERE:*

1: Kia EV6: 9.5/10

This could basically be a copy of my Ioniq 5 review; fun to drive, all the benefits of that 800v charging, but it fixed two of my issues:

First: The massive, ridiculous bezels around the display are black, so you don't really notice them

Second: I can comfortably set the steering wheel to not obscure my view of the dash. I'm not sure, maybe this is a trim thing, but that was annoying in the Ioniq 5

Otherwise, my main issue with the EV6 is that its priced more with equivalent options compared to the Ioniq 5, and I'm really not sure why. To have feature parity with the stuff that most people want, you'll be shilling out \~$4000 more, and when it's loaded (but not GT/N) it's around $3000.

post,1gydc1p,,Driving School,"Hi everyone. I’m at a crossroad and stuck with decision making.
I was in Aerospace (Boeing/Lockeed/SpaceX) and in 2022 I decided to start a driving school for teens. I had experience as an instructor when I was attending UCLA and was qualified to get a license (you’d need 2000 hours of experience, I had 5000 hours)
My ideas was to have an upscale driving school which really does high quality driving lessons. I’m based in LA. First year just with 1 car I did $4000 in sales (last 2 months of 2022), in 2023 I added a Tesla too (the other car is Honda HRV) and my sales were $36K. This year will be about $50K.
My biggest issue is instructors, I have no shortage of people calling. In 2022, 2023, and this year I just break even with no Salary for myself. I invested a lot of the profit in advertising and such. I spent $18K in Google ads in the last 2 years, but now I only spend $300/month and the phone doesn’t stop.
My dilemma is: should I get a huge loan like $200K-300K and hire full time positions, bigger office with driving simulators, basically going all out, or should I chill and keep going at this pace?
I worked 20 years in aerospace and am scared to lose my little condo I purchased in LA.
In my early 20s before attending ucla I had a successful clothing company for 9 long years but after 9/11 it imploded and I lost everything. So I’m scared.
My school has become very popular. I am the most expensive driving school in LA, and I constantly have to turn down clients because I don’t have the capacity. Just 2 cars and 1 instructor (myself) and 2 very part-time instructors.
Did I mention I only broke even? I reinvest every penny so that I don’t pay taxes (except payroll tax for instructors) Also my biggest cost is commercial car insurance for the 2 cars at $1200/month!
If I get more cars I can potentially pay $1200/year per car…

post,1gyznda,,Tesla Model Y Fatality Rates Exaggerated in ISeeCars Study,"TL;DR: The fatality rate in the study is overstated by almost 4x and the Model Y scores unremarkably in reality. This suggests the whole thing is bunk in the absence of clearer details surrounding methodology and data quality. 

Lars Moravy, VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla, has posted [the true Vehicle Miles Traveled for the Model Y](https://x.com/larsmoravy/status/1860100416819855492?s=46&t=zFWgbwSaBg4hfDSOnTly_g) on X to be > 7 billion which is used to calculate the fatality rate. 

I have downloaded the official FARS data from the [NHTSA](https://www.nhtsa.gov/file-downloads?p=nhtsa/downloads/FARS/) for 2020-2022 and filtered the *vehicle.csv* file in each one for the Model Y and occupant deaths. The Model Y was released in 2020 which is why these dates are used. 

This is done by filtering the VPICMODELNAME for “Model Y” and DEATHS > 0 for occupant deaths. This is documented on page 164 of the [FARS data manual](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813556). 

This yields the following occupant fatal crash counts:

- 2020: 0
- 2021: 7
- 2022: 13

So for 20 deaths between 7-8B VMT yields a true fatality rate between 2.5-2.86 per billion miles traveled. 

**This is significantly lower than the 10.6 reported in the study and is in-line with the overall average they reported at 2.8**. This suggests that the data they are using may have quality issues and we should likely reject the entire study without clearer details on methodology which are vague and obscure.

If anyone is interested in [5 of the 7 fatal occupant crash summaries](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/s/lzdyg4Hur5) I wrote for the Model Y in 2021. Drunk/buzzed driving and seatbelts seem to be a key contributor. Also all were head-on collisions.

Alright.

The NHTSA FARS data in question can be found here: https://www.nhtsa.gov/file-downloads?p=nhtsa/downloads/FARS/

post,1h15mew,,Nissan Ariya - Review of Car  and Trim Comparisons - Best Value *Used* EV (IMHO),"So I spent 6+ months researching 2021-2023 used EVs as the depreciation hit is huge on them.

The Ariya stood as easily being the best value  IF you can handle the slower charging speed (see below). Part of the reason is that Nissan had a great lease offering on them and many people are now returning these. You can get them now 50% of MSRP.

There are two battery sizes the larger one is designated by the ""+"" after the model.  
There are 4 trims: Platinum > Empower > Evolve > Engage  
There is an AWD version: Eforce

Some combinations are only available together. For example there is ONLY a Platinum+ AWD it doesn't come in any other form.

The + gets you a 289 mile range in FWD and 267 in AWD. That being said, if you are in a warmer climate (I'm in Northern California) you can easily get above 300 miles in both forms driving in ECO mode. The smaller battery gets you 216 miles.

FWD gets you 237HP (0 to 60 in about 7 seconds) and AWD gets you 383HP (0 to 60 under 5 seconds).

All trims are very well appointed to the point of being semi-luxurious. On par or better than entry level luxury-branded EVs (i.e. MB EQB series).

Engage has many standard creature comforts (NAV, 2 x 12 inch screens, heated seats, semi-autonomous driving)  
Evolve adds a few things mainly parking sensors all around and panaromic sunroof, power lift gate  
Empower adds just autonomous driving  
Platinum adds Bose stereo system, standard AWD, Ambient active noise, motion activated gate, Napa leather, ventilated and heated seats.

I guess Nissan got burnt by the Leaf battery episode so all Ariya's have battery heaters and they very conservatively allow them to be charged. This results in maximum 130 Kw charging at fast chargers and 7.2 Kw charging at home which is relatively slow. But the silver lining is that the fast charging maximum rate is held above 50% at faster chargers.

comment,1h1l03m,1h1l03m,,"If you still have time remaining on your lease, you have to pay the gross capitalized cost, minus the principal portion of your payments made, and the cap cost reduction. This is pretty standard for a lease.

If you buy out at the end of the term, you pay the residual value of the vehicle. This is what Tesla determines your vehicle to be worth three years into the future within the mileage limitations of your lease. That value is set ahead of time when you sign your lease and is a line item in the agreement - typically there is no negotiating this number (manufacturers set it at certain percentages off of MSRP; for instance, the residual value of my Kia EV9 is 50% of MSRP).

Some residual values on Teslas can be pretty high. There are posts in the Tesla subs showing residuals as high as 68%. Obviously you can get a used one much cheaper than that.

Depending on market conditions, you can really make out or not. The great thing is you don’t have to buy out - you can just turn it in and buy a used one at now market prices if your residual value doesn’t work out.

***Edit: Realized I should probably define some of these terms!***

**Gross capitalized cost** (GCC): the agreed upon value of the vehicle at the start of the lease. This is not the MSRP - its the negotiated price of the vehicle.

post,1h4063m,,A Second or Third Revisit of Why Warren Buffet May Not Have Fully Understood TSLA When He Said Value is Equivalent to the Whole Car Industry,"Hi investment friends, starting with the point of this analysis: Tesla, is a Wrigley's or a Coca Cola or our era but with a beyond imagining more future potential. 

Warren Buffett's although we love him, he's one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto ""invest in things you understand"" (it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz' most are very much understandable or it's just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as I call his favorites, assets like gum, candy, airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers) but there's still that constant, that he's not infallible. What it means to 'understand' has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before.

As most have said in the tech industry, sir Warren's fundamental which includes that it's highly speculative (also it's not on the record but it implies he's not into Elon Musk's kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but that's another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads Tesla) analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz' it's most likely incomplete. As most have said Tesla is not just a car company, it's not just a products company selling cars. What was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized, an example is EV cars that are practical compared to EVs from generations past, now you have the many Models of Tesla.

That means the company needs to grow 6x to be worth its current valuation.  
Since that will take time and you want return on your investment during that time, it will need to grow much more actually. So say 10x in 15 years. If tesla grows 10x in 15 years that would make it worth its valuation.

Now it MAY actually do that, but it is highly uncertain. Its robotaxis will not be the only ones on the market and they will have to compete both against other robot taxis and against private car ownership and self driving. The home assistance robots may fail entirely. Point is, it is uncertain. So we need to estimate an EV of the range of possible outcomes and then it still needs to be worth its valuation. There is some chance they will go broke, there is some chance they wont grow very much because part of their endeavours prove to be a failure or because some chinese competetor does everything they do but cheaper and yes there is some chance they will sell their robots and robotaxi's to the entire world. Now if that last chance is say 35%, that means in that scenario it wouldn't need to grow 10x but 30x in 15 years.

I hope you are starting to see why it is very hard to justify a P/E100 ratio for any company.

post,1h9i57c,,"I'm bullish on Rivian, and here is why.","Currently holding 65 shares, looking to round that out to 100 next pay period.  I am not a financial advisor, and this is not investment advice. I am simply sharing my thoughts. 

These are the things I will be watching this year, to continue to add to my position, or to see if I should reconsider my bullish sentiment. 

1. Nearing profitability.  Rivian has recently re-affirmed that by Q4 2024 we will be seeing gross profit per vehicle. They are expected to deliver just over 50,000 vehicles for the year. That is a combination of mostly R1S and R1T with some of the Amazon delivery vans. If there guidance is correct, and they either meet or beat q4 '24 earnings, it is a bullish sign.

  
2. $6 Billion loan from Uncle Sam. Now the new administration does create a bit of tension here.  The new ""DOGE"" agency is going to be cutting Gov. spending across the board. There is some concern they will take away this loan that the Biden administration had given to Rivian. While this is certainly a possibility, I do not think it is going to happen. I think it would be a very bad look politically, and would give strength to the argument musk will us his Gov. connections to attack his competitors. Because of that, I think this money is safely staying with Rivian.  If it turns out DOGE is going to back down from this threat, that is another bullish sign.

  
3. VW Rivian joint venture. VW NA is about to change, they are getting a new CEO, Kjell Gruner, who previously was the President and CEO of Porsche Cars of North America and then moved to Rivian to be there ""Chief Commercial Officer & President, Business Growth"".  VW desperatley needs software expertise, and Rivian delivers that in spades. That combined with VWs massive buying and production power, is a strong match. This is a bullish sign right now, and what I think has been pushing to stock upwards. 

VW has been hurting and their reputation is in the pits.",3083,True,1733662070.0,2024-12-08 13:47:50,53,111,TheMensChef,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h9i57c/im_bullish_on_rivian_and_here_is_why/,True,0.63,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1hadsm9,,"We keep hearing about cheap Chinese vehicles. Most of them are utterly useless in the US. When made for US spec, Chinese vehicles aren't that cheap.","Recently, I had the chance to visit a company that does benchmarking for everyone, globally against global vehicles.

European, Chinese, Indian, South-East Asian, and even African models are there. Most of their business is for four wheelers, and especially in new energy vehicles (Chinese definition), not battery electric, plug-in hybrids. PHEVs are described as new energy in China. But they have a wide variety of Chinese battery electric vehicles, and special permits they can drive them on abandoned sections of roads, which they upgraded to feel like your regular highways, and some cars can be driven after a few hassles on highways.

BYD, Xiaomi, Nio, Zeekr, Geely, AION, xPeng, Hozon, Li, Singulato, Changfeng, Jingling - these were the brands that they had on hand.

My thoughts -

Many of them had impressive all electric range. On the CLTC.

In real world scenario,

CLTC<WLTC<EPA

EPA range figures, after the 2024 edition will be something that is the closest you'll get to. WLTC is worse than EPA, because of its Europe focused, where city speeds are significantly slower. European city limits usually top out at 50kmph, which is 31mph. For reference, arterial roads, will have speeds of 40-45 mph regularly, and some wider 3+3 lane arterial roads can have speeds as high as 50-55mph, especially in Texas and larger Western states. In that matter China is much closer to US, wide city crossing arterial roads can be as high as 75kmph.

Some of the smaller, cheaper vehicles wouldn't be allowed in the US, due to sorb (small overlap rigid barrier), front impacts, side impacts, and even rear impacts. The cost to get them to be US legal, would impact their cost, sometimes as much as 20%. So when you hear news about $10k electric car, be aware that just getting it to be road legal would make it $12k instantly.

Second is range figures. CLTC when stated is for Chinese style of driving. Straight, flat highways have speeds as high as 120km/h. Most will have limits of 100km/h.",3835,True,1733762111.0,2024-12-09 17:35:11,230,332,Ok-Pea3414,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1hadsm9/we_keep_hearing_about_cheap_chinese_vehicles_most/,True,0.7,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1hao94n,,The tariffs against Chinese vehicles makes sense after seeing the BYD Sealion,"Autogefuhl posted a review of it that I just noticed: [https://youtu.be/Vsejh-DtyxU?si=XN8lOWILcjAChkYh](https://youtu.be/Vsejh-DtyxU?si=XN8lOWILcjAChkYh)

59K Euro's for the top trip and Tesla still costs a few thousand Euro's more. Then there's the build quality of the Sealion, which blows Tesla out of the water. Then there's the features...heads up display, rotating display, car play and android auto, working wipers, range etc.

Here in Canada, the government is following the US, naturally, and is imposing a 100% tariff on Chinese EV's. Mind you, this is all happening while the very same peoples are shouting about the environment and climate change being \*the\* existential issue of our time.

I don't know how to feel. I understand why NA/EU are afraid of Chinese EV's, and people having jobs that pay well and with dignity is also critical; but I really hate how we keep getting bombarded with exceptionally pricey EV's and even no tax breaks or very little, all while people are struggling to survive. WTF are people supposed to do but stick with gasoline vehicles then? It's not like public transport is any good or timely in winter especially.

This whole environmental/government angle has shot itself in the foot with how this has been handled. 

Sealion top trim is roughly $44,000 CAD without tariffs, with tariffs it is $88,000 CAD. 

Tesla Model Y is roughly $67,000 CAD for the LR without any special paint or FSD, etc.

Tesla Model 3 is roughly $63,000 CAD for the LR without any special paint or FSD, etc.

\^ This, is ridiculous and no amount of protecting our industries to give them time to play catch up, makes it reasonable for consumers.

post,1hcqtr1,,Returning to active stock portfolio management,"I recently decided to return to active stock portfolio management after my first attempt ended somewhat disastrously. To reconcile this experience and entertain others, I want to reflect on the mistakes I made and the new approaches I’ve adopted.

But first, briefly, the story of my initial failure.

When I started managing my portfolio, I quickly learned about the S&P 500 but was convinced I was smart enough to outperform the market. Arrogance was one of the main reasons for my downfall.

In 2019, I flirted with Bitcoin, which initially delivered great returns. Encouraged by the hype, I also invested heavily in PaySafe shortly after its IPO, believing in its potential because “everyone” said it was going to be great. At the same time, I was doing a lot of day trading. Looking back, I realize I wasn’t trading rationally. I’d look at graphs and invest simply because I felt the price would go up. I was taking desirable outcomes for granted.

Although I made a few conservative and reasonable investments, their success couldn’t offset the losses caused by Bitcoin’s decline, PaySafe’s terrible performance, and my risky trading. After 18 months, my portfolio was down 40%.

The arrogance I started with made the loss feel devastating. I abandoned my investment account for several years.

When I returned to it a year ago, I discovered that the growth of my conservative investments, along with Bitcoin’s recovery, had boosted my portfolio to 20% growth from my initial investment. I sold everything and bought into the S&P 500, feeling that I wasn’t capable of picking good stocks and should leave that to the fund. This turned out to be a good action, as the S&P 500 performed very well this year.

Now, I feel I’ve learned from my mistakes and am ready to approach active investing again. 

To avoid repeating the same mistakes, I’ve set specific rules to guide me:

post,1hcxguo,,"Model 3 Performance @ Streets of Willow: Touge Win, Lap Times, and EV Track Insights","I recently brought my Tesla Model 3 Performance out to a track event at Streets of Willow, organized by Corner-Exit.com. The schedule included a touge-style challenge and a traditional open lapping session afterward. The experience gave me a clearer understanding of how the Model 3 holds up when pushed in a competitive setting alongside traditional sports cars.

**Key Points:**

* **Touge Challenge:**
   * Cars involved: Tesla Model 3 Performance (my car), a Miata, and a 350z.
   * Advantage in EV: The standing start benefited the Tesla’s instant torque, consistently delivering 3.1s 0-60 launches simply by pressing the pedal.
   * Outcome: I took the top time of the day for the entire field of 50+ cars and managed to edge out the other cars Mod class, partly due to this strong start, although the Nexen N’Fera Sport R tires took some time to come into their proper operating range.
* **Open Lapping Sessions:**
   * Times: The Miata posted a 1:21.8, the 350z ran consistent 1:22s, and I recorded a best of 1:23.
   * Takeaway: While the Tesla excels at straight-line acceleration, its overall lap pace was slightly behind the top competitors, showing where EV performance stands against well-sorted ICE setups on a tighter track.
* **Side-by-Side Comparisons:**
   * To better understand performance differences, the 350z driver and I ran laps close together to compare corner exit speeds, braking points, and power delivery. It provided useful insights into where the Tesla’s torque advantage helped and where it couldn’t match a traditional RWD platform’s handling balance.

I’ve compiled footage from the event, including on-track video, telemetry overlay, and commentary, to help illustrate how the Tesla performed, what challenges I encountered, and what improvements could be made. If you’re interested in seeing an EV’s capabilities in a mixed field of more conventional sports cars, feel free to check out the video linked below.

post,1heu8rp,,The EV-9 solves our 3 adult seating problem ,"TLDR I’m no longer squished between my children in the back seat when my husband, my mom, my two kids and I go out somewhere.

We had a difficult time finding an electric car that could solve for our 3 adults plus 2 kids (1 car seat, 1 low booster). Whether we took our gas CX5 or Genesis GV60 I would end up sitting between the kids. At one point we bought my sister’s Volvo XC40 and had to sell it a week later because it had a hump in the middle of the back seat floor and was the worst by far.

Before I say anything else: between my sister’s and my family, we’ve owned a Tesla Model X, some sort of Tesla sedan, a Rivian R1S, the Volvo (all them) and the GV60 and EV9 (us). THERE IS NO PERFECT EV for big families/3 adults. Some of the issues I’ve seen/experienced (none new but bear repeating):

1) Model X: Putting aside any personal feelings about Musk, the 3rd row is super uncomfortable. I had to sit back there once and aside from feeling like I was in danger of being crushed the entire time, my 5’2” body was very uncomfortable. That said, after taking the GV60 on a terrifying road trip through SE Texas, I’d be nervous to take a non-Tesla on a road trip through this state again.

2) My sister loves her Rivian. My husband and I don’t love how “tanky” it feels to drive, but also we didn’t experiment with any of the settings. Regardless, the third row there is also exceedingly uncomfortable for a grown person (and again, I’m only 5’2”.) Due to car seat/booster needs/safety/daily use, an occasional adult passenger would likely go back there. the Also duh, it’s really pricey

3) The GV60 isn’t a three row, but it was what we used for over a year. I love that car. I love its features, the way it drives. People online say it’s ugly, but I’ve gotten so many compliments on it, take that internet.",2907,True,1734274699.0,2024-12-15 15:58:19,127,110,Praha3,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1heu8rp/the_ev9_solves_our_3_adult_seating_problem/,True,0.87,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

Kind of odd to mention this specifically (and again with the GV60) when the EV-9 does nothing to solve it.  Of course, the EV-9 (and GV60) should get access to SCs in January, but it just struck me as odd.

I know you can save a lot by charging at home, and you can save even more with TOU rates. However, I’m not sure if it makes sense for me to enable TOU rates. 

We are a household of 2 people (me and my fiancee) and 2 cars (1 EV, 1 ICE). 

One reason I don’t think it’s be good is we work separate shifts. My fiancee begins her work days M-F around 4:00am to get ready for work, and leaves the house around 5:00am ish. She returns home around 6:30pm. She often spends her nights doing laundry, and watching TV. She usually goes to sleep around 9:00 and sometimes I come home to find her asleep on the couch with the tv still on. 

My work days, typically M-Th, begin around 11:30am, and I leave around 1:00pm and I get home around 12:30am. I’ll usually stay up for 1-2 ½ hours after I get home relaxing before I go to bed, I’m usually on my phone so not directly using electricity. On Friday’s I’m usually home, however I do work the occasional overtime shift consisting of anywhere from 6-8 hours of work. If I don’t work on Friday, I usually spend my day off watching tv or playing video games (on Xbox) if that matters. 

On the weekends we are both home usually and spend the weekend watching tv shows, playing video games and doing laundry. 

Our big electrical usage comes from A/C (which we don’t really use during the summer, only if it gets really humid out), our washing machine and dryer, and now the EV charger. We live in an older home, and sometime run an electric space heater in our bedroom before we fall asleep during the winter, usually for 30-60 minutes. We live in southern Wisconsin and our electric (and natural gas) provider is WE Energies. Our most recent bill had us using 879 KWH priced at 0.17154/kwh, for a total of $150.78.

comment,1hfd3u7,1hfd3u7,,"I've got a Tesla model 3 and have experienced the other side of this. I don't know how this compares to other modern cars but it has a sort if L shaped headlight beam, I'm in the UK so might differ in other places. This is for illuminating the side of the road, signs etc but whenever you go around corners will shine directly into the windows of other cars.

post,1hfprfx,,Savings Diversity - General Questions,"So I have a general question about the cash that I'm keeping on hand.

I have about 40K in savings right now. Here is the breakdown:

33K in a HYS (3.8 APY)

6K in a different HYS (6.5 APY but I can only add 2K per month so I have an automatic transfer from the 3.8 account into this one. Every year the money all gets kicked out in August so it's a constant cycle)

$750 initially invested right now (650 in VTI/VOO ETFS - 100 in Tesla Stock)

I have about 13k in retirement as well (70% low risk 30% moderate risk)

Should I have more of my money invested into S&P ETFs that would likely outpace the 3.9 HYS? What do you think my diversity should be between all of these options?

post,1hfqs76,,3 years and 143k km with an EV in extreme cold Canada,"We live in prairie Canada so everything is in $CAD. We also get extreme cold (-30C to -40C or -22F to -40F) regularly. We bought an EV 2 years ago and it seems like everywhere we go, people are really interested in it. I did a 2 year, 109k km review that can be read [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatchewan/comments/18mysor/2_years_and_109k_km_with_an_ev_in_sk/) It goes into the background about why we decided to go the route we did, which EV's we considered, etc. Basically we drive a lot and were spending a ridiculous amount on fuel so wanted to reduce our costs. We have done that.

We decided to purchase a Tesla Model 3 because it was the cheapest AWD EV we could get and the Tesla fast charging (Level 3) infrastructure is vastly superior to anything else. Now, I don't think a new Tesla would be the best option for us. Used EV's are actually available now and prices have dropped a bunch. We would definitely go that route if we were to buy now. Tesla Superchargers are now open to a bunch of different companies and more will be added soon. The Tesla (NACS) charge part is now the standard that most EVs are using or will be using soon.

When charging at home, we use the mobile charger that was included with the vehicle. We just bought a couple adaptors for it. We installed a NEMA 14-50 plug in the garage. We did this ourselves for material cost, which was about $75. At the max 32 amps, it charges at 10% an hour. We park in a heated (5C) garage year round, but that is not a requirement.

For the life of the vehicle, we are averaging 210 Wh/km. Typical home power costs about $0.15/kWh. So on average, I can go about 5 km on 1.05 kW of power. Put another way, to go 100km costs about $3.25 with home charging. This pretty good considering the climate here. We have added solar to our home, so we try to charge as much as possible when the sun is shining, reducing our cost even more when we can.

Unfortunately, Tesla has increased the fast charging costs, again.",5240,True,1734376133.0,2024-12-16 20:08:53,125,30,SkPensFan,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1hfqs76/3_years_and_143k_km_with_an_ev_in_extreme_cold/,True,0.96,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1hfr8dz,,Achieved my first milestone after 3 years!,"After 3 years of investing, I've finally achieved my goal of investing my first $100,000! This was a challenge I gave myself after hearing Warren Buffet say you should strive to invest 100k into the market. *(I know that by now it's inflated to likely be the equivalent of 300k, but that's my next goal.)*

I did this by living with my parents and paying low but fair rent, finding a decent job that pays 75k-80k a year, avoiding fast food where possible, and just being frugal in general. 

**Investment strategy:**

1. investing $10 every business day into both VOO and VOOG. *(roughly $400 a month)*  
2. investing in Tesla when Tesla is low. *(this is 20% of my portfolio. My largest position.)*  
3. keeping my ear to the ground, and capitalizing on things like meta's stock devaluing. *(Though, I totally missed Nvidia sadly.)*  
4. diversifying into other promising tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google. *(less than fruitful, but it's still diversified.)*

I think the riskiest strategy has been in Tesla. In the past, it's been difficult watching the stock go up and down, but I had faith in their business practices and ethics. Now Tesla is popping off, and given Elon's position with Trump, this should give room for Tesla to continue its growth. Sadly, because of that, I can't view Tesla as much as an ethical company as much as I could in the past, but that won't diminish it's ability to grow and I see the stock continuing to rise in the future.

**Looking forward:**

Since Tesla isn't going to be low for some time, one thing I want to invest in going forward is in clean power companies, such as nuclear for AI companies. So I'll continue looking into that for future paychecks to go to. Any recommendations are welcome!

My next goal will be to reach $300,000 invested by the end of 2026. What do you all think? Achievable?",1850,False,1734377264.0,2024-12-16 20:27:44,75,25,zerossoul,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfr8dz/achieved_my_first_milestone_after_3_years/,True,0.85,2024,both,search,False,False,0,
post,1hfs25j,,"Reminder: If You Trade More, Wall Street Makes More Money","I've spent a few years reading Warren Buffett and other value investors. Essentially what I learned is that they make money by other people pushing prices too high or too low. Especially when prices become too low, they swoop in and buy a bunch. Next they sit on it a few years until the price goes to the correct valuation again, or preferably after many years when the company deteriorates.

Time and time again, people have predicted that Buffett's strategy will eventually stop working. We nowadays can learn much more etc etc.

Yet, stock prices are all over the place. Tesla doubled in the last 3 months for example. How is that possible? How can a 1T dollar company double in value in 3 months? They still build the same stuff with roughly the same people. Similar for Bitcoin. Also almost doubled in a few months. If that was inevitable according to some metric, then why was it not priced in?

At the same time, there is a common sentiment online that the world is becoming more and more unequal. More wealth accumulates in the hands of a few people.

So let me say this: if you are currently considering buying into some stock that went up recently, please let me remind you that there is only one party that will always make money from your trade. It's not you. It's your broker/Wall Street. They don't care whether you make money or lose money. Some will slam ""price targets"" on stocks if that makes you trade.

So now there are 2 versions of the same car from the same year, one with HW3 and one with HW4. At the time I remember people on reddit were debating if the car they just saw had HW3 or HW4. Others advising everyone to wait until HW4 start to officially roll. And some were getting there reserved car as HW4 and others as HW3 depending on where you are and which gigafactory made your car. It was a chaos, and it felt super misleading from Tesla.

Don’t get me wrong, I still love my car, I’m not planning to upgrade anytime soon, “maybe I’m a bit upset that my 2 years old car feels obsolete now “ but I barely even use FSD (only when I get a free month lol) but why doesn’t Tesla make it clear what hardware version you’re getting?

post,1hfy0q8,,Ponzi Spotting: a laymen's guide to differentiating investments from Ponzi schemes,"I often see things being called Ponzi schemes on Reddit that are very much not Ponzi schemes. Usually, it always stems from the criticism that a particular investment only goes up in price because someone newer is paying a higher price for it. Hence, it must be a Ponzi.

I’m going to blow your minds a little bit. 

Almost all (legitimate) investments require new investors willing to pay a higher price for older investors to cash out a profit. 

Most investable objects, REGARDLESS of what underlies the object, trade at a price on a market. This means, at the margin, some percentage (usually only a small percentage) of the total available supply of the object is trading hands. The trade is priced typically in your local fiat currency, but this does not necessarily have to be the case. Prices are determined by supply and demand. When an investable object goes up in price on a market, it means there were no sellers of the object at the lower price, and price goes up until the next marginal seller decides they are willing to part with that object at the higher price. 

The use of the term investable object is intentionally left extremely broad. It essentially means anything quantifiable that can be owned and traded. This includes contracts, stocks, bonds, physical objects, digital objects, etc. 

**Example 1.** You bought a 1st edition charizard for 20 dollars when it came out in the 1990’s. Since it was relatively abundant (still being printed by the company) and Pokemon was relatively new at the time, the supply was high and the demand was low. Fast forward 30 years, Pokemon is super popular and there are very few 1st edition charizards remaining (out of print for decades, many were lost or destroyed through the years). You now are able to sell the charizard for 10,000 dollars to a guy that just got into Pokemon card collecting.

>That leaves TSMC and its upcoming investment at 2nm and 16A, which is a challenge for ASML for three reasons. First, there is the aforementioned shift in TSMC’s model; repurposing equipment likely means fewer lithography orders. Second, while ASML may have a monopoly on advanced lithography, TSMC is poised to have monopsony power in terms of being able to actually make money on processes that utilize ASML’s advanced lithography, which may depress prices (this is the third factor that could help TSMC’s margins). The third challenge is that we are past peak lithography.

It’s raining, freezing temperatures, and it’s windy. It’s the worst possible scenario for any car, but especially an EV with an Iron Phosphate battery. I’m a responsible little gremlin and take regular breaks at least every two hours so I planned a stop at the new Skelton Lake services in Leeds as having never done a long journey in this car I was unsure how it would perform in poor weather at motorway speeds, thus I decided to get a top-up.

I connected to an Ionity brand charger and used my “Octopus Electroverse” card to initiate and pay for the charge. For those not in the know, my home energy provider (Octopus Energy) dished out free RFID cards for people on EV tariffs; at a supported charger you simply tap it as you would a debit or credit card and the charge will be billed to your electricity bill. Honestly fantastic and I wish it was universal given my account is constantly in credit. Regardless of what card you use, you simply connect the plug and tap once.

I only added 14.54kWh to the battery as I got a coffee and cinnamon bun in the frankly lovely Skelton Services (North Americans, take note, this is what a motorway stop should be rather than the depressing gas stations with half a Wendys stapled to them I had to endure in Canada and the north eastern US).

post,1hgkgpz,,Added a 2nd EV This Weekend!,"For the past few months, my husband (43M) & I (39F) have done a ton of EV research with the plan to buy or lease a second one in late spring. After the US election results, we decided to move that timeline up to…now. Financially, that actually wound up being a better decision because of end of year deals & incentives.

I currently drive a 2022 MINI Cooper SE. Her name is Winnie Cooper. She gets about 110 miles of range per charge. Our other car is, legally my grandmother-in-law’s, a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee with quite a few miles on it. Cosmetically, it’s in GREAT shape. His grandparents took really good care of it. Mechanically, something needs fixed about every other month now & we decided it was time to get something new.

Neither of us have a commute & we live in the city, so Winnie’s been perfectly adequate for around town driving. We need a larger vehicle for several reasons - my husband’s family lives about 60 miles away & Winnie is not able to do the drive on a single charge. They’re in a more rural area and there is literally one charger near there. It’s a Level 2 and it’s at a casino. The charging is free but the gambling is not! We also have 2 giant dogs & neither fit in Winnie. So even just going to the vet, we need something to haul them in. Add in the occasional CostCo run and it’s just easier to have a larger car for those trips.

post,1hi4190,,"Upgrading our 2013 Leaf battery from 24 to 40kWh at GreenTec Auto (US national chain) - rocky start, fingers crossed...","I towed our old Leaf over to GreenTec today and dropped it off.   Current battery is 24kWh at 37% SOH, new one should be 40kWh with at least 85% SOH on all modules.   Battery was on sale for just under $8k, install is $1k and with tax it's a hair under 9500 total.  (Yes, I know I could get a new Leaf for a similar price, the rest of the car is great and I wanna pass it down to my kid one day)

So far the process hasn't been great honestly but I'm hoping that will change now that they have both the battery and the car in-hand.   

The TL;DR is that I completely understand that delays happen, especially around the holidays - but I think it's pretty lame that I've gotta chase them down to get any sort of info.  

  
Back in November I had some free time so I decided to swing by the shop and pop in to check the place out and hopefully schedule our upgrade.  Arrived to find nobody answering my knocks on the door so I called the main line and the person I spoke to said they're appointment-only as their team is often out doing mobile hybrid installs.  OK, my mistake.    
  
So I placed the order for our battery through the person I was talking to at the time and was told they were a little backed up so it might be a week or two before they call us to schedule.  Understandable, no worries.      That day was Nov 11.  

Didn't hear anything from them, gave it some extra time for the Thanksgiving holiday and Dec 2 I called the main number to get a status update.   Was transferred to the DC shop and left a voicemail.   No response.   Next morning, same thing - call, transfer, voicemail, crickets.  Called again that afternoon and pointed out that taking our deposit and then ignoring us wasn't the best new customer experience and eventually got a call back from someone (shop manager IIRC?) who said they've got 2 other cars ahead of us and we should expect to drop off the car sometime the week before Xmas (this week, 12/16-20).",3171,True,1734644824.0,2024-12-19 22:47:04,13,20,nerdy_hippie,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1hi4190/upgrading_our_2013_leaf_battery_from_24_to_40kwh/,True,0.82,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

It was ignored coz' no one was buying much. It's always tough to see looking forward (it's always looking back of course that one see gems that could be hidden), though I always look at who's creating what, who's the real leader and Canoo's leader seems maybe a few percentages of Elon Musk. 

The Canoo founder has a lot of patents it seems, innovative it seem similar to Elon (but not as big like Elon's pre-Tesla and SpaceX, like PayPal or Zip2) had a successful venture (Solera I think). 

But only time will tell if the pattern will repeat itself with Canoo, it has a great design, innovative, especially their MPDV (I wish that was the one they focused on but had a smaller non-van version with the same). It just needs to launch already their working models (unlike that Nikola truck which even got GM fooled) have amazing design especially the shelf mechanism of their nice looking MPDV. 

If they just did a pre-order which is a genius strategy pioneered by amazing Apple, God-willing they will break through but they also need to upgrade their battery from 200mi to 320mi for good measure. They need to launch now coz' the chinese EVs are coming with tariffs by Pres. Trump or not- it's like 'finished or not finished pass your papers.'

post,1hiq21y,,"Every Monday morning I invest $1,885. Here is how I divvy it up, can y'all provide feedback/opinions on my investing strategy please?","I'm an early 30s single guy with a solid income. I invest $1885.00 every week which amounts to roughly half of my take home pay, and I live off the other half.

I live in a very high cost of living city and I rent an apartment. I've got a very long time horizon so I'm trying to be aggressive.

Here is how I divvy my money:

Stock | Amount Invested | Percentage of investment
:--|:--:|--:
S&P 500 ETF (VOO) | $700 | 37.14%
NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) | $400 | 21.22%
MAG 6 (no Tesla) | $180 ($30 each) | 9.55%
Small Caps (AVUV) | $120 | 6.37%
Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) | $100 | 5.30%
Financial Sector ETFs (XLF and IAI) * | $80 ($40 each) | 4.244%
Semiconductors ETF (SMH) | $80 | 4.244%
Individual Stock Picks I like (15 in total, listed below) ** | $225 ($15 each) | 11.94%
**TOTAL** | $1885 | 100%

*The difference between XLF and IAI is that XLF is mostly financial services such as JP Morgan Visa, Mastercard, Bank of America, Wells Fargo etc..., whereas IAI is mostly brokers and securities dealers such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Schwab, S&P Global etc... There is only a 15% overlap between these two ETFs.

**The 15 companies I like that I invest $15 each into are: Adobe (ADBE), AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Chipotle (CMG), Salesforce (CRM), Door Dash (DASH), Netflix (NFLX), ServiceNow (NOW), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Palantir (PLTR), Shopify (SHOP), Sofi Bank (SOFI), Uber (UBER)

---

I think at first glance, some will say that there is a little redundancy here, such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism, although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually, in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds.

Also if they've given up, they wouldn't try to not get it delisted by opting for a 1-for-20 split. A lot of companies' stocks were around that much (about a dollar or less) for a very long time, around a decade or so like Tesla or NVDA.

If Canoo would only launch already, I know (strong conviction) they will do great (not Tesla big, Elon Musk in a way is an anomaly, his Musk Enterprises hedges the companies within it), God willing.

Yet it feels MUCH bigger inside, and has nearly 50% more cargo space. Most people would say the efficiency hit is worth it.

There’s something to be said for a slightly larger car that is more comfortable for the average person. People like cars they don’t have to scrunch down to get into, that they can comfortably stretch their legs inside.

One concern I have is that I charge my Tesla in our residential building, which only has the basic power outlet. It’s never been a bid deal with the model 3, because we can just top up 50-80km overnight every couple of days, and that’s all we need. 

Would an iX or another luxury SUV be much different? If the batteries are bigger and range not as good, is it not practical to have an EV SUV in my building, even if we don’t drive that much every day?

post,1hniumv,,"Got my heart set on a Model Y, but my family keeps talking about how bad they are.","Context: Am in the U.S.

I've been looking at used Model Y's for a while now, and I've decided I’m gonna get one, particularly one with FSD due to vision issues that impair my ability to drive. (I can still see well enough to drive manually if need be, it’s just the fact that I’m legally (half) blind and have bad peripheral vision makes it difficult, especially in bad weather or at night.)

(Just use public transit or bike! I hear you say. No. I can’t ride a bike due to medical conditions and public transport here in the US where I live is frankly shit. A car is my only way of getting around quickly.)

(Keep in mind: I haven’t actually received or insured the vehicle yet, I’m in the process of going through financials at this point, and I hope to get one sometime within the coming months.)

However, my family (more specifically my father) doesn't like them at all. 

He always brings up ""horror stories"" of Tesla's dying and breaking down all the time, poor reliability, cars needing expensive repairs, slow charging times/not being able to charge anywhere, bad build quality, etc.

I know at least some of it is inaccurate, but him saying all these bad things all the time is putting me on the fence. I'm just curious on how many of his statements hold up, if at all.

EDIT: Home charging is set up already for those wondering, due to my mother owning a Rivian. I’ll most likely use that charger with the included adapter.

EDIT 2: My mother and I are running it (the Tesla) through her insurance, alongside payment and delivery. I’m responsible for regular upkeep and any modifications.

post,1hnmey6,,Counting EVs on the highway for fun (it's not),"Don't read this (or too much **into** this) unless you are as bored as I was. Every conclusion here is a small sample of observable stuff during a trip, so take it with a pinch of road salt.

**TLDR** : The Equinox EV is selling more than I thought, and Nissan EVs apparently can't go on the highway (joke, of course). Read more for my hot takes that will undoubtedly change your life.

I spent too much time doing this for its actual relevance. I'm off work and I do what I please with my own time, thank you very much

The other day I was a passenger on a pretty slow day on the highway with a couple of hours to go. Decided to count every visually-obvious BEV either oncoming or passing us (we were going 100 kph in our Bolt EV, so we didn't really pass anyone ourselves except some vans and the occasional slow semi). Driving on the A20 transcanadian highway in Québec, in cold temp (about -10 Celsius, so I expected to see less of short-ranged EVs). I thought I'd see something interesting during our 2 hours trip, and that it would be a fun (ok, not *very* fun, but I wasn't driving), objective way of figuring out popular brands and models... with some caveats :

* I probably did not recognize or spot every model, especially models that have ICE counterpart (ie : Soul and Kona)
* At some point we were in a traffic jam and some occurences might have been either missed or misindentified because of cars partially hidden.
* I did not include PHEV even if some are easy to recognize (ie : the Prius), because that would be unfair to other PHEVs that are very similar to ICE models
* I get distracted, sometimes. Let's assume it affected every model equally and move on.

Here's the list of EVs I spotted, by brand in alphabetical order (If I forgot a brand or model, it's because I didn't see it anyway) :

**BMW** : 2 total

* 2 unknown SUVs (I don't know their models but they were definitely EVs)

**Cadillac** : z e r o

* None

**Chevrolet (and Hummer)** : 40 total (#1)

post,1hnpnj4,,Audi EV Range Monitor Gauging Problems - can this be fixed?,"Greetings, 

My question for you is - do you know of anyone who has had this problem - is it fixable?

I bought a new Audi 2023 Q5 Sportback in January 2023.  I had had a Tesla Model X for 5 years, so am familiar with EVs, charging, range monitor, battery usage, etc.

I started having problems with the range monitor, although at the time, I didn't know that was the problem.  I took the car to the dealer in Jan 2024, after less than a year of ownership, because I couldn't get it to charge to the regular 227 miles when the Audi app was showing 100%.

Just a few facts: I live in the balmy San Francisco Bay Area, and my car is always in my garage, which almost never dips below 50 degrees.  My driving habits haven't changed.  My use of the heater, AC, seat heater haven't changed.  I live at 150 feet elevation and almost all of my driving is on relatively flat land.  

I have brought my car to the dealer three times to fix this problem; they've had it for a total of 14 days.  Their response to me:  no repairs needed 

Here is some of my recent driving data:

I drove 1.5 miles to the store and back.  Here is what the  range monitor showed during the 3-mile roundtrip:

Range shown   Mileage

   204                20,434

   194                 20,434

   165                  20,435

   167                  20,435

   223                 20,437

   202                 20,437

   225                 20,437



Additionally, here are some examples of when I charged it on different days to 100% 

192 miles of range shown on range monitor

211

227

215

162

168

204

215

220

203



This is not affected by the temperature nor my driving.  These are extremes, and I had this car for a year with out these wild vacillations.

Again, my question for you is - do you know of anyone who has had this problem - is it fixable?

Thank you so much for reading all of this.

I recently had the BMW iX M60 for a week as a loaner. I have driven most of the EVs out there, including another week long road tripper (the Mercedes EQS), currently own a Hyundai IONIQ 6, a BMW X5 and BMW M3. I decided to provide some info about my experience road tripping this iX M60 for a week and 700 miles with my family over the Christmas holiday while my wife’s X5 was in the shop. 

Spoiler: not terribly impressed! 

I did use ChatGPT to format this review a bit nicer and closer to a more traditional automotive review, hope no one is too upset but your reading experience is much improved trust me. 

2024 BMW iX M60: A Mixed Bag of Innovation and Compromise

The BMW iX M60 enters the crowded luxury EV market with the promise of blending BMW’s trademark driving dynamics with cutting-edge electrification. Positioned as a performance-oriented alternative to the likes of the Mercedes EQS SUV and Tesla Model X, the iX M60 seeks to redefine what a premium electric SUV can be. Yet, after a week of real-world testing, including a 700-mile road trip, it’s clear that the iX is both a showcase of BMW’s engineering prowess and a reminder of where the brand’s EV journey still falls short.

Charging Woes: A Pain Point for the Price

For an EV that commands a base price north of $112,000, charging performance is a glaring weakness. The iX M60’s advertised fast-charging capability of up to 195kW seems promising on paper, but in practice, it struggles to maintain consistent speeds. Over the course of our trip, the vehicle averaged an underwhelming 90kW at 350kW-capable stations, often dropping to 135kW or lower within minutes. This resulted in 40-minute waits to charge from 20% to 80%, a frustrating reality in a segment where faster charging curves are becoming the norm.",6656,True,1735352092.0,2024-12-28 03:14:52,0,32,SneakyHobbitses1995,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1hnvez0/a_review_of_the_bmw_ix_m60_after_a_week_long_road/,True,0.44,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1hnwhlf,,Tesla's Genius Autonomous Strategy and Implied Supremacy,"Tesla's autonomous program FSD (Full Self-Driving) will inevitably become the prime competitor in the U.S. to Waymo, and the leader everywhere else where it is legal. I have this conviction because I can look clearly at the actual comparisons of the vehicles statistics rather than their permit level. The reason that it makes sense to ignore the permit level, is that Tesla intentionally declares their autonomous program at Level 2 Autonomy to avoid the increased regulations on testing that Level 3 or Level 4 incur. 

Essentially, what Tesla has seemingly believed from the inception of their FSD program, was that **more Data = better system**. And I agree with them. If we look at any machine learning program or deep learning that has aimed to create a high fidelity system, most of the time the **sheer scale of data has increased output quality immensely**. In deploying their FSD to independent owners who supervise it, they essentially are able to scale their data collection **without** hiring and deploying ""skilled safety testers"" like Waymo has had to in the past to collect data and train their model, giving them a huge leg up in cost efficiency and scalability. 

People don't realize how good Tesla's FSD because of Autopilot's failures. The rollout of Autopilot and the marketing of it has a lot of criticism for good reason, but Full Self-Driving may as well be a different system with how markedly different the crash rates between them are. This is also combined with the fact that **Waymo vehicles have not operated on freeways** while Tesla vehicles have. Waymo only recently began testing on freeways, which is quite insane to me because how can anyone believe that Waymo has achieved technological supremacy when they only started testing on freeways a few months ago?? 

**All of these reasons contribute to my belief that Tesla will achieve Level 5 Autonomy first**.

comment,1hp84q6,1hp84q6,,"Alright, since some people like to be an asshole instead of answering like a normal human being, here’s my answer based on my personal experience. Buying at an all-time high raises eyebrows for some, but if you’re investing in a company with strong fundamentals, who cares? I don’t worry about MSFT’s price, I invest monthly regardless. There’s a well-known quote: “I don’t buy stocks, I buy companies.” Personally, I’m focused on accumulating shares and adding more to the companies and ETFs I believe in. More shares, bigger returns in the long run. If MSFT drops 20%, that’s a 20% discount on future financial freedom.

Now, if you’re out there chasing hot stocks at an all-time high because of FOMO, well, that’s on you. But if the company is solid, don’t sweat it. Prices fluctuate, sure, but eventually, they tend to climb back and hit new highs.

For those still uncertain, stop banging your head against the wall and stick to ETFs. Companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are solid, wide-moat businesses. Unless some major negative news breaks, there’s no reason to panic about the price.

That said, I’d be cautious with Tesla. It’s a volatile stock, highly sensitive to news, and that unpredictability can lead to some headaches.

comment,1hpnnfc,1hpnnfc,,"Aerodynamics will start to noticeably affect your fuel economy at around 50 mph. Above 60 mph, the effect is even more pronounced. Granted that Teslas have very good design to reduce this effect, but you will lose more range than you think once you’re above 60. 

AAA did a study and found that a Toyota Prius, for example, got 58 mpg at 60 mph but only 47.5 mpg at 70 mph. A Ford F150 got 24 mpg going 60 mph, but only 19.4 mpg at 70.

Speed is not the only factor at play here. Acceleration affects range too and even climate control settings will nudge your efficiency down. 

Also, the range estimates are based on a particular style of driving. I’m not sure what algorithms are used in the Tesla software to determine range, but EPA range estimates are based on 20 mph with multiple stops for city driving and 48 mph for highway. This results in numbers that can be up to 30% off real world results. 

You stated that you’re driving 80% of the trip at 80 mph.

post,1hwm6z3,,Have Musk's companies collectively made an overall profit across their lifetimes?,"I was explaining to someone the other day how it was that Sam Altman could be a billionaire despite OpenAI not coming close to profitability yet, by referencing the tech industry's model of leveraging huge VC funding via the promise of future market dominance. Whilst I was doing so the question above popped into my head, and I realised I had no idea whether the richest man in the world, who is regularly hailed as a genius, has actually made a total net profit across his companies. For this question I'm only counting the relatively mature ones, namely Tesla, Space X, Twitter, Starlink, SolarCity and The Boring Company. It doesn't seem fair to include Neuralink or any others than are still very much in R&D phase.

Two of these companies - SpaceX and Starlink - are doing very well currently, and look well set for future growth, Tesla is doing OK but there are warning lights flickering, and as for the others, well....

What I'm really interested though is, at this point in history, two specific questions:  
1) have the companies listed above made a collective profit or loss across their lifetimes to date?

2) how the collective profits (if any) of these companies compares to the investment that they have taken in to date, ie their collective return on investment.  
  
I appreciate these could be seen as unfair questions to ask, as that investment was premised on significant further growth far into the future (even when, as with Tesla, those projections stopped making much sense a long time ago), but nevertheless I still think its worth asking, given that in the here and now Musk himself is using the wealth accrued from these companies to such dramatic effect.

I’m 23, living in Kent UK and feeling a bit lost in life. I’m not sure what direction to take and don’t really have anyone to ask for advice. I want to feel achieved, leave my mark on the world, and of course, earn a living. Here’s a bit about me:
	•	I graduated in 2022 with a degree in Industrial Design but haven’t done much design work since.
	•	My previous jobs include working in an acrylic-making factory, co-owning a coffee trailer, and waitressing, and in lockdown I started a 3D printing and Vinyl business for small accessories and personalised products. 
	•	I currently live at home with my family, which I’m happy with for now. My mum had a stroke just over a year ago, so I’ve been caring for her, and my parents have been financially supporting me (I’m super grateful for them).
	•	I’d love to own a business someday rather than work for someone else, but I don’t know what kind of business that should be. I’ve enjoyed the business ventures I’ve tried so far. 
	•	I enjoy design, but my drawing skills aren’t great. I do love working with tools like Fusion 360 and Adobe Illustrator. I feel like I’m “okay” at a lot of things but not excellent at any one thing.
	•	I love hands-on work like model-making and prototyping which is definitely in some of my hobbies like puzzles, Lego, and Rokr sets.
	•	I’m passionate about mental health. My final university project was a bench concept designed to encourage conversation without the pressure of eye contact—it’s still one of my proudest creations and the model still sits on my shelf. 
	•	I also enjoy cooking, being outdoors, hiking, and geocaching, it’d be great to merge some of my hobbies into a business. 

I’ve been considering starting a graphic design business, but I feel like I’d need to learn a lot more before feeling confident. I’ve done some logos and posters here and there, but I’m worried my creativity isn’t strong enough to stand out.",2943,True,1738964138.0,2025-02-07 22:35:38,0,4,Elsclrkdesign,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1ik6eh5/im_stuck_in_life_and_need_some_guidance_on_what/,True,0.5,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Initially, I believed every DOGE cut was to protect Elon Musk and the other oligarchs, but mostly Elon. It's not about government savings.  

* CFPB to prevent lawsuites against Musk's Tesla, et al.
* FAA for SpaceX
* IRS for Billionaires and tax enforcement
* NIH for NeuroLink
* Treasury for payment funneling

**HOWEVER, at the end of the day, I think Elon has another end goal:** 

DOGE is training various AI models on massive amounts of government data to ultimately ensure an Elon AI model(s) will be embedded permanantly into the US government making pennies off each prompt. Leading to the first 100 person, $200 billion in revenue organization.  

Privatized AI government employees. An organization that will never by publically traded.

So, it makes more sense that those 4 stores ran a backlog of sales through the system from all 33 stores rather than assuming that 29 stores sold zero cars that weekend and one store sold 1,200 in a day.

post,1j8d48n,,DANGER: DO NOT TOW WITH A CYBERTRUCK? - (catastrophic failure test),"Video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubUXNSWGth0, quite the title

Description:  The Tesla Cybertruck is built with a cast aluminum frame <redacted sponsor> This helps the cyber truck be manufactured extremely quickly. However - cast aluminum is not good for towing as we see in this Cybertruck durability test video. The hitch breaks around 10,000 pounds. (4500kg) Which is far too close to the 11,000 pound towing capacity. Yikes. 

Saw the video circulating around reddit with outrage elsewhere, was looking for some discussion. Thousands of valid reasons to hate the cybertruck and the company behind it, but unless I am missing something it seems like the cybertruck did quite good here no? He put pretty much pure tongue load on that hitch, the tongue weight rating on this is 1,100lbs from tesla, and it only failed @ 10,000lbs, nearly 10x. 

Justification given for the test in the video was that with improper loading or an impact trailer weight can/will be converted to tongue weight, but I feel that is user error and under similar circumstances the rivian wouldn't fare particularly well either. I think SAE standard here its 50% GVWR x/y and 150% z, which it would pass fine. 

Could argue that the failure mode isn't ideal as demonstrated in the whistlindiesel video, and the properties of aluminum aren't ideal for a truck & perhaps we will see failure over time, but it seems to me like he proving tesla's engineering right here? (and as an aside, his explanation of fatigue limit was backwards). Same thing with the glue, modern 3M panel bond & similar adhesive hold up just as well & often better than welding, cars are full of structural adhesives. 

I don't really get the point of the video, nor the ""yikes"" response, I feel content like this takes away from the hundreds of real issues with these products.",2241,True,1741650204.0,2025-03-11 00:43:24,0,97,hi_im_bored13,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1j8d48n/danger_do_not_tow_with_a_cybertruck_catastrophic/,True,0.45,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,
comment,1j8d48n,1j8d48n,,"His phrasing was backwards but the idea is correct. 

He further explains later in the video how trailer weight will absolutely determine forces felt through the receiver. 

Regardless of your feelings on the matter, myself, my truck and my 34’ conventional enclosed trailer will remain clear of any heavily loaded cybertrucks.

post,1jaowts,,How many of us would be sad if Nissan went under?,"I know a lot of Reddit loves to clown on Nissan, but at one point they were one of the best in their game. The Y61 Patrol, the 300ZX, the S-chassis Silvias, the R32/33/34 GT-Rs - these were legendary cars, and even their VIP sedans like the Laurel, Cima, Cefiro (especially when the Cefiro was RWD in its first generation,) Cedric, Gloria and the like were great. In the US, the original Pathfinders were 4Runner, Blazer and Discovery competitors, while the Sentra SE-R proved that even compact sedans could be fun - something we see with a lot more of today's compact sedans (like the Elantra N, for example.)

Even into the 2000s, when Nissan was already starting their decline, they put out some bangers - the G35/37 (Skyline) was seen as what the Z buyer got after starting a family - the performance of a sports car with the added practicality of a sedan. The M35/45 (Fuga/Gloria) was a super underrated luxury sedan that offered a compelling alternative to the Lexus GS and a way to get an otherwise-JDM only product in left hand drive. The FX35/45 was a trendsetter in the luxury SUV world - it paved the way for the Porsche Cayenne, Land Rover Range Rover Sport, and other sportier luxury SUVs as well. The 350/370Z were widely celebrated at launch - a sports car for the 21st century, one of the best-handling cars this side of a 911 and a worthy model to carry the iconic badge. And even their regular stuff wasn't half bad - V6 Altimas and Maximas in the USA were sleepers - the V6 Altima had more power than the Camry, Accord or Mazda6, the XTerra was another 4Runner alternative, the Primera was a competitive hatch in Europe, the original X-Trail came from an era when crossovers were still fun and cute and not every other car on the road, and the Elgrand minivan in Japan oozed VIP elegance in that oh-so-JDM way.",3386,True,1741905574.0,2025-03-13 23:39:34,0,32,thats__hot,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1jaowts/how_many_of_us_would_be_sad_if_nissan_went_under/,True,0.43,2025,both,search,False,False,0,

According to pretty much all of Reddit, CO2 emissions are going to kill us all.  Even leaving out the more extreme way of framing this, CO2 emissions already kill a lot of people each year.  So EVs are a way to make an immense difference and fairly quickly.

If you follow space news, you might know that we have a few close calls with big space rocks over the next few years.  And there are probably more we do not even know about.  And we have so many neato ways to wipe ourselves out; Putin threatens us with one of them on a daily basis.  So I would think it is a no-brainer that we need to spread out more to prevent a ""one and done"" scenario.  That is such a clear case of saving humanity, I do not know how to engage with someone who does not see it.  It would be like trying to convince someone that the sky is not, as they keep claiming, a brilliant shade of neon brown. (There's a joke within a joke there, if you can find it :) )

There's Starlink which is probably changing more lives for the better right now than any other single project.

Then there is Neuralink.  Despite the more broken people of Reddit's claims, this project is successful and helping people right now go from being completely jailed within their own bodies to being able to interact with the world again.

post,1jfkoj5,,I legit don't understand the Elon/Tesla hate.,"Hey guys,

I've been a fan of Elon for a very long time. I've read both biographies, watched easily \~80%+ of his interviews (there are a LOT out there now), and I resonate deeply with so much of how he thinks and what he does for the world.

That said, clearly, he's rubbed some people the wrong way.  
At the very least, there's a lot hatred being directed his way.

I'd love to explore this with people and help bridge what seems to be a growing divide.

I think the first step is by beginning to understand the people who do have hatred for Elon & Tesla, why that hatred is there?

I trust that more people than not genuinely want good things for the world, so I think we have that in common, and I'd like to build on that.

post,1jfpo6n,,I’ve been very impressed by BYD while visiting Brazil,"I’ve been in Brazil for 15 days and love this BYD dolphin. When I first saw it, I did not love the styling, but it’s been an absolute joy. I’ve driven Teslas (model 3 and model y) up and down California numerous times. The BYD feels more luxurious and less cheap in almost every way. 


I have not experienced a single phantom breaking while in a BYD. I had 3 in one day the last time I drove a Tesla. On the byd, the driver assistance has just worked. 


The interior is MUCH better. Tesla seats and interiors feel cheap. The stealing wheels wear quickly due to how thin the material is. I thought a Tesla was quiet due to the lack of ICE, but the BYD has much less road noise on wayyy shittier cobblestone roads. The seats are more comfortable and EVERY surface material feels more less cheap and flimsy.


The car is much more intuitive than a Tesla. The Tesla OS is always a pain to figure out where basic shit is. I had to pull over and watch a YouTube video to figure out how to do something on a road, but have found the dolphin to be very intuitive. The screen also rotates from landscape to horizontal which is nice to watch YouTube. Charging has taken 20-40 minutes each time.


On the whole, the BYD felt like a proper luxury car (think lexus) while the Tesla just felt very cheap and gimmicky. If we could get BYDs in CA, I’d buy one when I got back. The Dolphin plus is R$169k which is under $30k usd.


TLDR: the BYD dolphin is surprisingly nice and I want one.


Edit: I’m a California lawyer who is passionate about cars. My business / family fleet is currently:


Rx 350 f sport, Yukon Denali xl, 4Runner, forester xt, mazda 3, Corolla, a 2023 model y, and 2 Tesla model 3s (2019 and 2024).

Screw over enough commonly rich people, and the wheels of legislation start to turn and eventually run over to the super rich.

I'm not trying to argue, I'm genuinely trying to inform you. While it's fairly inconsequential to be attached to tesla, it would probably be beneficial to recognize the emotional labor you're expending for the sake of a brand. I'm not in a cult, I'm just a normal guy. I own things from multiple brands based on my own personal discernment.

comment,1jjg3qn,1jjg3qn,,"You brave soul. I’ll try…

The lefts main argument is that he is an unelected official affecting government policy (ie not confirmed by the senate). These actions are causing government agencies to be shuddered and public funding to be slashed at local communities (ie departments of education, department that funds public libraries, parks and wildlife, etc). 

There are plenty of counter arguments, my first being that there are articles that allow private citizens to give goods and services to government for free (like software and service), which is what Elon is doing, to identify waste and fraud in many agencies. So, essentially they have circumvented Elon being confirmed by the senate. This is good because this allows the government to allow quickly without being bogged down by the swamp of judges, media, and politics. 

I believe if people spent some time listening to other viewpoints and understood the goal of this administration, while also listening to the other side, they would be more inclined to cheer the wins and still be honest enough to point out the short comings (which there have been). 

Podcasts that have been great lately are especially Gavin Newsons new pod, listening to Tim Walz speak, Bernie and AOC rallies, All In podcast especially episodes with Lutnick and Bessent, Chris Cuomo, and Bill Maher.

post,1jrqzht,,Rocket Lab (RKLB): A Promising Space Stock for the Post-Musk Era,"Elon Musk’s ventures have long dominated “space investing” conversations – but with Musk’s recent controversies and the fact that SpaceX isn’t publicly traded, investors are turning toward Rocket Lab as an attractive alternative. Rocket Lab (RKLB) is a \~$10–11B market cap space company that offers something SpaceX doesn’t: public market access to a growing space business, minus the Musk-related volatility. Let’s break down why RKLB might deserve a spot in a forward-looking portfolio:

* Robust Growth Trajectory: Rocket Lab’s financials showcase a company on the rise. 2024 revenues hit $436M (+78% YoY) , and Q4 alone grew 121% YoY. They’ve consistently increased launch count (16 launches in 2024 vs 10 in 2023) and expanded their Space Systems segment (which now brings in \~two-thirds of revenue via satellite manufacturing and components). Gross margins are improving (32% non-GAAP in 2024) , pointing to economies of scale. While the company is not net profitable yet (as it reinvests in growth), Wall Street expects continued top-line expansion and eventual operating leverage as larger projects come online .
* Catalysts on the Horizon: The big one is Neutron, Rocket Lab’s next-gen reusable rocket aimed at the medium-lift market. Management has scheduled the first launch for H2 2025 . This could be a game-changer – Neutron is designed to lift up to 13 tons to LEO , putting Rocket Lab in direct competition with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 for many satellite launch contracts. If successful, Neutron opens a much larger addressable market (national security launches, interplanetary missions, even crewed flights eventually). Investors are watching this closely; any positive development (engine tests, on-time construction) could boost the stock. In the meantime, Rocket Lab isn’t waiting around: they’ve signed new launch deals (e.g.",5349,True,1743812749.0,2025-04-05 02:25:49,1,15,cheese_and_toasted,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jrqzht/rocket_lab_rklb_a_promising_space_stock_for_the/,True,0.56,2025,both,search,False,False,0,

I posted something on another sub that one of members of this community suggested would be better received here. So, I decided to give it shot with this one. I get that this is ""TLDR"" for most people so if you are not into that, let me jump right to the question for you:

Will the negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's stock enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?

post,1ju68ef,,How China’s Restrictions on Rare Earth Mineral Exports would Affect the EV Industry,"China’s restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, notably tightened as of April 4, 2025, are poised to significantly impact the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) industry. Rare earths like neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium are essential for the high-performance magnets in EV motors, while elements like lanthanum are used in batteries. China controls roughly 60-70% of global rare earth mining and nearly 90% of processing, giving it a chokehold on the supply chain that the U.S. EV sector heavily relies on.
The immediate effect is supply disruption. The U.S. imports about 74% of its rare earths from China (down from 80% a decade ago), and with export controls escalating—starting with gallium, germanium, and graphite in 2023 and expanding to other rare earths in 2024 and 2025—manufacturers like Tesla, General Motors, and Ford could face shortages. A single EV motor can require 1-2 kilograms of rare earth magnets, and with U.S. EV sales projected to hit 1.5-2 million units annually by 2030, the demand for these materials is massive. Without a steady supply, production lines could slow or halt, delaying deliveries and driving up costs.
Cost increases are already in motion. Post-restriction price spikes have historical precedent: in 2011, when China cut exports, rare earth prices soared—neodymium hit $67,000 per metric ton. Recent data shows neodymium at $75,097 per metric ton and dysprosium up 4.65% to $250.60 per kilogram as of late 2024, with analysts expecting further climbs in 2025 due to these bans. EVs already use six times more minerals than conventional cars, and with graphite (another restricted mineral) being the largest component in battery anodes (up to 136 pounds per EV), battery prices could jump 18% or more, pushing sticker prices higher and potentially slowing consumer adoption.
Geopolitical leverage amplifies the strain. China’s moves are a response to U.S.",3615,True,1744090345.0,2025-04-08 07:32:25,6,2,kmmeow1,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ju68ef/how_chinas_restrictions_on_rare_earth_mineral/,True,0.58,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1juwpro,,Crude oil an investment with price floor,"With most investments, they have an effective price floor of zero. 
Nvidia, Tesla, GM, BAC any company can go to zero over night but because of the intrinsic self balancing feature of oil price as controlled by OPEC and non-OPEC members. 

Crude oil has a price floor because the producers all have a breakeven price that if it goes under, they all start losing money so they reduce output and bring their price back up. 

For US shale producers in the Permian Basin, that's around $60bbl. For the UAE that's $59bbl. Qatar is $42. 

Right now WTI is at a 52 week low of $62. If it drops another $2 a lot of US producers are gonna start losing money. 

Even with the recession risk that'll drop demand, the suppliers will correspondingly drop supply to keep prices stable. 

As soon as the economy picks back up again, the crude oil price will increase.

My question is, does it make sense to dollar cost average out of the stock as well? For example, let’s say that I want to own 20k usd worth of Tesla.  If Tesla continues to rise so that I could sell a share and still have 20k would it make sense to do that and dollar cost average out?  In the same sense that Tesla goes down so I have less than 20k I would then purchase more shares to get my total value of Tesla stock up to $20,000?

post,1k5htk8,,Tesla reports 20% Q1 drop in auto revenue,"Brutal numbers from Tesla after the bell. 

As we all know, their stock performance is often decoupled from results. Little movement in futures so far, but curious how it’ll move tomorrow. 

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

…

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

post,1k8mm3o,,Sold all my Tesla shares before the crash. Here’s why I still think that was the right call (even at today's price),"A couple of months ago, prior to Tesla correcting by \~40% I no longer believed in the thesis of their stock valuation so I sold my entire holdings. Despite my continued admiration for Tesla’s tech, from an investment standpoint, I remain bearish—and it has little to do with the political horizon. Here’s why:

**Robotaxi: A Limited Revenue Catalyst**

Tesla plans to launch an unsupervised robotaxi service in Austin by mid-2025. However, even Tesla has admitted these vehicles will require human remote monitoring to ensure safety and regulatory compliance—a reality that adds cost and complexity.

The U.S. rideshare and taxi market today generates \~$52 billion annually, projected to grow to \~$61 billion by 2029. Capturing a meaningful slice of that pie won’t be easy:

* Waymo already operates fully autonomous fleets across Phoenix, San Francisco, LA, and Austin, and is expanding into Atlanta, Washington, Miami, and Tokyo.
* Pricing will be critical—and Tesla is playing catch-up technologically.

Even if Tesla somehow captured 25% of the entire U.S. market—a wildly optimistic scenario—it would generate \~$12 billion in revenue and $1–1.5 billion in profit over a decade or more.

More realistically, even under bullish forecasts, Tesla could earn \~$2 billion in revenue and \~$200 million in profit from robotaxis by 2029.

Compare that to Tesla’s current \~$80 billion revenue base.

It would move the needle by only a few percentage points—and that’s assuming everything goes perfectly.

Bottom line: this isn't a market-changing opportunity.

**Optimus: Exciting, But Decades Away From Prime Time**

Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot is expected to be priced around $20,000–$30,000. Elon Musk recently suggested a \~$30,000 target.

At that price, most consumers would expect meaningful labor-saving ROI within 3–5 years. Tasks like:

* Cooking
* Laundry
* Grocery management
* Lawn care and snow removal

Ordinary folks don't own Bitcoin or Tesla.  A recession will likely trigger selloffs across the board though for a variety of reasons:  margin calls, unwinding leveraged positions, building cash to buy cheaper, etc.

>is there a chance that those sales could trigger a panic around those assets? 

Associated with most recessions you see panic across the market.

>Or is the pricing still anchored around what institutional investors are doing?

Institutional investors also panic and/or try to front run market panics.  So there is no anchoring there.

I think there is a lot of potential here if companies can adopt them to save money with more manual work.

My biggest worry with Tesla is the controversy surrounding it. Tesla's name has been completely destroyed internationally. BYD was already beating them by a lot but now its going to be bad.

post,1khk8sf,,"Google is at a 40 pe ratio, excluding the search revenue","Yes, this is another post about how cheap Google is.

Here’s the deal: Google’s net income for 2024 was $100 billion, with 55% of that coming from search.
With a $1.8 trillion market cap, Google would “only” need to have a PE ratio of 40—this is considering revenue only from its fast-growing segments like Cloud, YouTube, Waymo, etc.

To put it in context, here are a few companies with similar businesses and their high PE ratios:

Microsoft: 34
Netflix: 54
Tesla: 152
Palantir: 480
Google (excluding search): 40

This completely excludes the search business, as if it stopped generating any revenue overnight. That obviously won’t happen. Even if we see a slowdown in growth or a decline, search will still generate massive amounts of money, which can be used for significant buybacks—like those seen in the last quarter.

TL;DR: Google is basically a fast-growing company with a PE ratio of 40, plus a “dying” business that’s still going to generate around $50 billion annually for the next five years.

post,1kndhf3,,Is a new classifier needed for electrified CUVs? Here's how they differ in size from their ICE counterparts:,"From my quick look at 10 ICE models and 10 EV (plus Toyota Crown Signia) equivalents, the **electrified** counterparts are (on average) **2.4 inches lower, 2.9 inches longer, and 1.7 inches wider**. I included the Tesla Model Y and did the Mazda CX-5 as its ""ICE counterpart"".

  
These dimensions aren't hugely different on paper, but that's more height and width difference than the current Chevy Trailblazer/Equinox and more in all dimensions than Honda Pilot/Passport. It's a noticeable terms of style and presence. They're obviously more optimized for EV range, while also being in a familiar and friendly CUV shape that buyers are used to and comfortable with.

  
Should we start calling this class of vehicles EUVs or something? It seems like there are 1-2 new ones per year, and they continue to grow in popularity.

Below is the list I used for my comparison.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( \^DJI ) rose about 3.4%. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have now recovered losses from the tariff-induced sell-off at the beginning of April, and are in an uptrend range so far this year.



Recently, the situation has begun to change. Since the beginning of May, large tech stocks have contributed 60% of the S&P 500's gains, led by big gains in Nvidia, Microsoft and Tesla. Shares of both Tesla and Nvidia have risen about 30 percent or more in the past month, while Microsoft's shares are up about 20 percent.



Goldman Sachs chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin raised his year-end target for the Standard & Poor's 500 to 6,100 from 5,900 after China suspended tariffs, and thinks big tech stocks could be in for another rally after a strong first-quarter earnings season.

post,1kq3drf,,"Now that the future has arrived, Musk’s promises are collapsing one by one. Robotaxi,Cybercab and Car sales plummet","Now that the future has arrived,  Musk's lies are also being exposed one by one. Have you seen the latest news? On June 19, only a very small number of so-called Cybercabs will be used on the road, and only by invitation, but NHTSA still thinks this is wrong. Musk has not responded to NHTSA yet. What kind of autonomous driving will the so-called Cybercab be and how will it be regulated? Of course, Musk's good friends in the White House may directly ask NHTSA to give up all questions about Musk.

Musk is unfortunate because all the liars have been exposed before him, and he has to face more stringent investor supervision. For example, the protagonist of ""Bad Blood"", a lady who doesn't blink, investors are fed up with boasting but not delivering, and Musk must deliver. But the problem is that once it is delivered, the lie will be exposed.

Without L4 autonomous driving and Robotaxi comparable to Waymo, everything about him is being sniped. Just like when Cybertruck was released, Tesla fans asked me, ""Look, the slap is so fast and strong, call us daddy. Musk is a god."" Because in the previous year, I have been saying that Cybertruck has no market at all, this is a vertical segment. The main scene of Truck is work, not play. And they think that everything I, a dull ITIL consultant and a third-rate business school auditor, say is ridiculous. But after I shouted daddy to everyone in the chat room and accepted their humiliation. In less than a year, Cybertruck sales collapsed. I want to find them on Twitter and let them prove that I am not wrong. But they all said to me, ""Do facts matter? We made money, hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock market returns. Hold on to your truth and go back to Australia. Loser."" Now the same is true for Cybercab. Musk made it, but no one will pay for it. He can't even catch up with ""WAYMO, the backward smart driving using lidar"". After all, Waymo is L4 autonomous driving, certified by NHTSA. And Musk is L2.

post,1kqs7zz,,Is this why markets have been not making sense?,"A lot of people have been stumped about why markets have not been making sense. Trump announced tarrifs will go down but tariffs still hurt the economy and somehow the market goes up. 1 country strikes a trade deal and market goes up. Tesla reported terrible earnings then stock goes up. Moody's downgrade of US rating, as well as the largest store in the USA says prices will increase because of tariffs and market finishes positive during the first trading day after the news.

Smart investors are looking to make sense of a stock in order to determine a buy or a sell but literally everything seems unpredictable.. The resounding answer from the community seems to be ""the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent."" and all the other common phrases you hear here. But what if it is being rational? 

I've seen a lot of the blame placed on institutional investors trying to manipulate the market or they don't know what they're doing. ""There's a reason 86% of them don't beat the S&P."" But what if we have been placing blame on the wrong group? 

YTD institutions have taken more money out or bet against the market significantly more than they have put in. AKA, if they controlled the stock market like they used to, the market would be nearly as predictable as we are used to. 

What I think is not being accounted for is the exponential increase in retail investors. YTD retail investors have pumped the market with loads of cash and optimism. Retail has put in significantly more positive cash than institutions have negative. 

Maybe we need to think less about how the market has reacted in the past or what institutions think. But take more of a balanced approach, taking into consideration retail investors.

However I'm not sure from where we would draw this retail investment consideration?

post,1kr1vlf,,CATL goes public in Hong Kong Listing - climbs 16% in debut,"CATL is the world’s leading EV battery maker and a symbol of Chinese dominance in green energy manufacturing. It’s already very profitable. A company to watch closely as EV’s grow. 

From Bloomberg: Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. jumped in its Hong Kong trading debut after the Chinese battery giant wrapped up the world’s biggest listing this year by raising HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion) despite being blacklisted by the Pentagon and grinding through geopolitical storms.

Shares of CATL, as the largest maker of electric-vehicle batteries is known, climbed 16% to HK$306.20 on Tuesday. Though Hong Kong shares of Chinese companies typically trade at a discount to those in the mainland, CATL soared above its stock price in Shenzhen, where it rose 1.2%.

For investors, the allure of buying into a blue-chip stock at the forefront of electric-vehicle technology outweighed the risks of getting caught up in the ongoing turbulence in Sino-US relations. The success of the stock offering, which may increase to $5.3 billion if CATL exercises an option to do so, single-handedly doubled Hong Kong’s proceeds from listings this year and could embolden other companies to go public. 

CATL is “a true champion enabling the energy transition, a symbol of China’s success as a global green leader,” said Karine Hirn, a partner at East Capital Group. 

Priced at around 17 times current earnings multiples, CATL’s Hong Kong shares have room to rise 50%, driven by strong earnings and attractive valuations, said Johnson Wan, head of China industrials research at Jefferies in Hong Kong. 

CATL supplies batteries to top-tier customers such as Tesla Inc., Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co. and Mercedes-Benz Group AG. It has a market share of roughly 38% in electric-car batteries, comfortably ahead of its closest challenger, top EV maker BYD Co.’s 17%, according to SNE Research.

“Yes, no doubt about that at all,” Musk said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Qatar Economic Forum in Abu Dhabi.

Musk’s comments come after some investors have questioned his dedication to Tesla.

He has been serving as a key advisor to President Donald Trump in leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which has been a major focus for the tech billionaire in recent months. The stock has had a volatile start to the year, and is down more than 12% year to date.

post,1kr9p3w,,U.S. stocks in modest pullback as brief market optimism may be overdone,"Just finished reading today's stock market quotes, and U.S. stocks are finally showing some signs of cooling off.



The S&P 500 and Nasdaq each fell about 0.4%, ending a six-day winning streak. The main reason for this is that everyone was too optimistic about cooling inflation and a temporary cease-fire between the U.S. and China on a tariff deal. Now it looks like that optimism is a bit untenable.



Home Depot earnings report came out, revenue is not bad but profit did not meet expectations, the stock price fluctuation. I'm not sure I buy the idea that prices won't go up. After all, even Walmart is saying they'll have to raise prices.



Tesla continues to surge, Musk said in Qatar, “unless I die”, or will continue to be CEO, the market ate this again.



Bitcoin is also up, breaking $105,000 on the back of stablecoin legislation that passed a hurdle in the Senate.



A lot of tech stocks hit record highs, like Netflix, Uber, Visa, but it kind of seems like they're overdrafting the future.



Jamie Dimon and a number of Fed officials are cautioning not to get too happy too soon, with a rate cut not due until September and trade uncertainty still lingering. You still have to be cautious about buying stocks now, and there could be a major pullback at the first sign of a market flap.

post,1krcrsh,,Tesla's New Self-Driving Ride-Hailing Service – A Game Changer?,"Hey everyone – just saw some big news. Elon Musk announced that Tesla (TSLA) is launching a self-driving ride-hailing service in Austin, TX. It’ll start with about 10 vehicles and scale up to 1,000 within a month. He also mentioned a goal of having 1 million fully autonomous vehicles in operation by the end of next year.

The service will be geo-fenced for safety and allow Tesla owners to rent out their autonomous cars, similar to Uber or Airbnb’s model.

TSLA stock jumped over 3.5% intraday on the news, while competitors like Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) dipped 1–2%, showing how seriously the market is taking Tesla’s expansion into ride-hailing.

If you believe in the long-term potential of autonomous mobility and tech disruption, this might be a major growth driver for TSLA. Definitely something to keep an eye on.

post,1krh3sj,,"Elon Musk says Tesla, xAI expect to keep buying chips from Nvidia and AMD","Elon Musk said Tuesday that he expects Tesla and xAI will continue buying chips from semiconductor giants Nvidia and AMD, and possibly others.

Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, which now owns X (formerly Twitter) has already installed 200,000 GPUs at its Colossus facility in Memphis, the Tesla CEO told CNBC’s David Faber on Tuesday. XAI is also planning a 1 million GPU facility outside of Memphis, Musk said. 

He did not specify how many chips the company had already ordered and by which date they may be installed.

“A few years ago, I made a very obvious prediction, which is that the limitation on AI will be chips,” he said.

Last year, Musk directed Nvidia to send a large order of GPUs to xAI first, jumping the line ahead of Tesla.

At his autos business, Musk said Tesla’s Dojo supercomputer in Buffalo, New York is already used for training its Autopilot and Optimus robotics systems.

Musk boasted on Tuesday that xAI’s Colossus is the “most powerful training cluster in the world right now” with “over 200,000 GPUs training coherently.” Musk’s choice to build in Memphis, Tennessee, was hailed by city officials as transforming the region into a “high-tech manufacturing hub.”

But local communities there have protested the power- and water-hungry operation, specifically the way that xAI has relied on natural gas-burning turbines to help power the supercomputer.

The turbines emit smog-forming nitrogen oxides (NOx), precursors to ozone formation, which have been associated with higher risk of death from respiratory disease.

As CNBC previously reported, environmental advocates say that xAI has likely “violated the Clean Air Act” and local permitting requirements for “major sources of air pollution” with its use of the turbines.

post,1krowzj,,Elon Musk confirms Tesla's June 2025 plan for robotaxis in Texas,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed that the company will have robotaxis on the streets of Austin, Texas, by the end of June. In an interview with CNBC’s David Faber on Tuesday at the company’s headquarters in Austin, Musk said Tesla aims to bring its robotaxis to Los Angeles and San Francisco following the planned Austin debut. 

Musk said a Tesla robotaxi service will start with about 10 vehicles in Austin, and rapidly expand to thousands of vehicles should the launch go well with no incidents. To start, Tesla has said its robotaxis will be Model Y vehicles equipped with a forthcoming version of FSD, or full self-driving, known as FSD Unsupervised. Musk said Tesla “will geofence” its robotaxis in Austin to start, meaning the company will limit where those Model Y vehicles can drive. But there won’t be a human safety driver in the cars, Musk promised. Tesla employees will be remotely monitoring the fleet, he said.

post,1ksmqw7,,"Peugeot E-3008 - Review after 20,000km (12,500 miles)","**Dear fam,**

I'm living in Germany and picked up my Peugeot E-3008 (with the standard battery – 73.0 kWh net / 77.0 kWh full) back in January. I wanted to share some of my experiences so far after 20,000km. If you have any questions - feel free to ask.

For context, I previously drove mainly BMW and Audi, and I also have about two years of experience with a Tesla Model 3 LR, plus a few months each with a Polestar 2 and VW ID.4 – so those are the benchmarks I’m comparing this car to.

# Overall impression

A high-quality vehicle with an amazing interior and strong pricing, though it has some limitations when it comes to charging in winter.

# 💰 Price & Value

I don’t think many EVs can beat the price/performance ratio of this Peugeot.  
Mine is fully loaded: infotainment, panoramic roof, heated *and* cooled seats front & rear – all for just over €60K in Germany. The hardware quality is on par with VW and Polestar, slightly below Audi, but far above my 2021 Tesla Model 3.

# 🛋️ Interior

I really love it. Everything is super fast – no lag when opening maps or menus. The interface is intuitive, and shortcuts for common functions are easy to access. Took me maybe 5 minutes to get used to, and now I’m a fan. The adaptive cruise control is amazing and the best I have ever had in a car. The side assist is not ideal as the car drives slightly drunk from left to right.

# 🔊 Sound system

I love bass-heavy music – and this sound system is **insanely** loud. Honestly, you can’t even turn it all the way up unless you want your ears to bleed. The bass is punchy; Tesla probably had the stronger subwoofer, but this one comes very close – best I’ve had outside of that.

# ⚡ Charging Speed DC

I usually charge from 5% to 55% on road trips – it goes from \~170 kW down to 100 kW within \~15 minutes. The official 20%-80% in 29 minutes is doable – **in summer, with a warm battery**. Avoid fast-charging in winter with a cold battery – speeds drop significantly, just like with most EVs.",2910,True,1747907419.0,2025-05-22 11:50:19,42,39,OpenCouple1995,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1ksmqw7/peugeot_e3008_review_after_20000km_12500_miles/,True,0.91,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,

It would also help with towing on the model X

- even faster on the plaid trim

Aka I want the specs that Tesla unveiled for the plaid+ in 2021

- more colors, we really need a dark green ( like the Alfa Romeo one, there was also a model 3 wrap that looked stunning)

- self presenting/soft closing doors

- automatic frunk open/close

- elettro-obscurable roof glass, like the taycan.

Here are some stats to weigh in on:

2019 Model 3 performance 
78.8kWh battery 
310 miles (minus degradation)
Hardware 3: FSD okay 
Trade in: $15,300+$1000
Current loan payments: $555.46
29 months left on loan @ 8.44%
Interest: $1562 over next 2.6 years 

2025 Model 3 performance 
82.1kWh battery 
315 miles
Hardware 4: FSD much better & zoom calls
Refresh internal and external
Headlights, dynamic refresh 
Cost:$54,990, transfer FSD
Down payment: $4000
($54,990-15,300-1000-4000‎ = $34,690.00)
Tesla offer 0% interest 60 months
$34,690/60‎ = $578.17

Conclusion:
578.17-556.46‎ = $21.71 more per month
Better FSD, longer range (new battery)
Dynamic Headlights.

post,1ktfc9f,,"The Doha interview confirmed that car sales are still Tesla's anchor, and Musk is trying hard to blur this anchor.The crisis is coming quiet","The Doha interview confirmed that car sales are still Tesla's anchor, and Musk is trying hard to blur this anchor. He also hopes that investors will look to ten years later.

As an investor, it is very important to look forward to a better future, because this is the basic concept of investment. However, this does not mean that we only look at the future and not the fundamentals of a company, that is, the main business. Not to mention what if this so-called future is unreliable? This interview can confirm that Saudi investors are very dissatisfied with the sales of his cars, which is Musk's most hated topic. After all, he has said that he doesn't like the car business anymore, and he wants to make cooler Robotaxi, robots, and FSD. And these are all far away.

I know that many Tesla fans have been insisting on proving to everyone how great FSD is. But you know, although many people have shown that FSD can travel 300KM, even across the east and west of the United States without human intervention once. But on the NHTSA registration list, it is L2 autonomous driving. I even wonder why NHTSA allows FSD to be approved without holding the steering wheel. After all, it is only L2 instead of L3 or L4. Of course, this is not important. What is important is that the foundation of FSD today is not enough to support Robotaxi.

I have also met Tesla fans who told me, ""If FSD really doesn't work, at most we can add a lidar, which is not a difficult task."" When I used the logic of business school to analyze it for them, when lidar is added, the competitors will become WAYMO, and WAYMO has been leading for 5 years in using lidar and getting L4, so Tesla will have to catch up.

Tesla fans said contemptuously, ""So what, does WAYMO have a rocket? Can it take us to Mars?""

In the past, Musk could always say Next Year, but when Next Year has arrived, what should he do? Forever Mars plan?

post,1ktff15,,"Electric trains, buses and cycles are more efficient and practical ways of electrification than electric cars!","Electric trains and buses have existed for century. Massive transit systems like Newyork Subway, London underground, Paris metro, Moscow metro, trams and trolleys have been successfully fully running electricity for nearly a century. 

India has electrified 99% of their railway network. It's 75% for china. 70% for France and Spain. 55% for Russia and Germany.

Then we come to electric bikes. They are selling a lot more than electric cars even in USA where there isn't any proper cycling infrastructure.

https://www.bicycling.com/news/a39838840/ebikes-are-outpacing-electric-car-sales-in-the-us/

Trolley buses have existed for decades in many cities. From Moscow to Mexico city.

Electrification of buses with batteries are also a lot more successful than cars.

https://www.sustainable-bus.com/news/bloomberg-new-energy-finance-long-term-forecast-on-electric-buses-vehicles/


 You can have buses with much smaller batteries and use opportunity charging as buses would wait sometimes in terminal any way. Also it's much easier to implement battery swapping for buses than cars. Also in motion charging with trolley bus wires too is possible.

Then we come to resource consumption for cars vs public transportation. Let's take battery needed for electrification. Shenzen has a 100% electric bus fleet. An electric bus would mostly have 500 kWh battery pack. This can be reduced below 100 kWh by opportunity charging (like pantograph charging or battery swapping). Let's be conservative and assume you need 500 kWh battery per bus. And there is one bus per 500 residents in Shenzen. So it comes down to only 625 Wh/person. If they owned cars they would need atleast 15,000 Wh/person assuming one car with 60 kWh battery per a family of 4. This can go upto 60,000 Wh/person or even higher if there's one car per person.

You can also use trolley buses for very busy bus routes. Which would only need a very small battery.

Then the amount of infrastructure needed.",3871,True,1747993213.0,2025-05-23 11:40:13,135,247,One-Demand6811,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1ktff15/electric_trains_buses_and_cycles_are_more/,True,0.81,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,

As someone who has lost a significant amount of money shorting Tesla, I'd like to share my thoughts.

**Stage 1: Inception**

> TL;DR: Elon and Tesla capitalized on three key movements: the green movement, cultural status, and visionary leadership of the third industrial revolution.

To understand Tesla today, we need to look back 20 years. Tesla should never have succeeded. There has not been a new car company to sell over 9,000 cars (the DeLorean) in over 100 years before Tesla. Tesla's founders aimed to transform the world by developing an electric vehicle to propel the world toward a green future. Looking for new investments with his PayPal winnings, Elon joined the Tesla team. The founders had a vision and direction, but over time, Elon pushed for continually expanding changes and leveraged his funding and chairman status to execute a Coup d'état to become CEO.

To Elon's credit, it worked. The Roadster was a wild success. Elon leveraged this momentum to convince governments to create billions in long-term subsidies, which enabled them to establish a legitimate foundation as both an industrial power and a strong brand among those invested in the green revolution. He also leveraged this momentum to establish a powerful following of loyal customers who shared his mission and to attract top talent seeking a brighter future.

This also created a flywheel of success: Elon leverages his status to market a new revolutionary dream -> people believe him because of his previous success and the desire for it to be true -> personal or government funding is generated that drives this dream -> Elon forces through objections and doubt -> the dream is partially implemented -> Elon's status as a visionary leader is enhanced.",10221,True,1748006096.0,2025-05-23 15:14:56,32,25,Epicism,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ktjam4/tesla_vision_volatility_and_the_illusion_of/,True,0.74,2025,both,search,False,False,0,

Seriously, even many EV-nerds shy away from road trips in Bolts. Possible? Sure. Fun? Ehh...

The EV6, on the other hand, is one of the very best at DC fast charging. If these are your choices, insist on an EV6.

You will need a NACS->CCS adapter to charge either car at most compatible superchargers. Exceptions are if the SuperCharger is one of the few-dozen stations in the US equipped with MagicDocks. Cross-reference the stops in ABRP with the Tesla app (or website) to confirm compatibility. Or if the EV6 is a brand new 2025 model; it has a native NACS port so it can use ""most"" Superchargers without an adapter.

You can DC fast charge at other public chargers like Electrify America, EVGo, Ionna, etc without an adapter. Unless it's that brand new 2025 EV6; then you will probably need a CCS->NACS adapter. Yes, adapters are a way of life with DC fast charging now...

Also, for technical reasons, an EV6 will DC charge faster on many non-Supercharger DC stations.

comment,1ktunpc,1ktunpc,,"You definitely shouldn't trust Tesla to be competitive by the time that could possibly become a common household item. If Musk says they are looking at $20-30k I would expect $40k. 

Amazon already has a home robot on the market for $1000 that they can use to train their programming and scale up in cost and functionality. They already have Alexa and ring in people's helping train the AI to work more effectively. 

 To me that makes them the clear front runner. Even if Tesla offers one for $20k, Amazon might be able to offer something comparable for $10,000, have more integration, and have a much better platform to get it to people at a lower cost. 

I'm also not sold on the viability of a $20,000 robot that does dishes and laundry  for 99% of Americans. Its like.

My husband sent me a screenshot of a charge to our account for a charging station that is 30min from our house (we charge overnight at home and never charge at public stations unless on a long range trip) and when I called electrify America customer service, they just kept repeating that it shows our car charged for 29 min through the app (Mercedes app in this case).

Editing to add this has nothing to do with the login for my ChargePoint app. The charge was made through the Mercedes app for my specific vehicle, which requires multiple verification processes including a one time code sent to the screen on the vehicle. It was not charged to my CC by logging into my ChargePoint. It was charged from my Mercedes app through my specific vehicle to apply the charging credit issued by Mercedes, which is processed through Chargepoint.

post,1ku94ha,,Trying to Learn – How Do You Short Tesla Smarter?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve taken a few shots at shorting TSLA recently—some decent reads, but I keep getting caught by timing issues or stop-losses. One example: a few days ago I set my sell order at $355, but the stock topped out at $354.99 and never triggered. Then it dropped hard, and I missed the trade completely.

I currently hold small positions in Alphabet-C, Apple, Nvidia, gold, and REITs—so I’m mostly flat now and just watching the market.

Looking to learn and improve.

1. What strategies or indicators do you use when shorting Tesla?

2. How do you avoid getting stop-hunted or missing entries by a few cents?

3. Any good risk-management habits I should adopt?

Appreciate any advice. Trying to trade smarter, not just chase price.",741,False,1748085021.0,2025-05-24 13:10:21,0,105,Hmmm_nicebike659,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ku94ha/trying_to_learn_how_do_you_short_tesla_smarter/,True,0.44,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1kum63j,,How bad can it get when crypto goes POOF?,"Right now there is about 3 trillion market cap in crypto, which is making a lot of people feel significantly richer than they are. supposing crypto market cap goes to near zero, I do not think there has ever been a wealth destruction event like that ever in the history of markets. I think it could have significant impacts on the global economy, causing a very real financial crisis.

AI is probably in a bubble as well, there are very obvious stocks at the very least which are beyond reason, such as tesla and Palantir.

These seem to be a staple in the modern portfolio, and could contribute to an even greater loss of the wealth effect.

the wealth effect would further deteriorate as multiple compression occurs across the board in a bear market.

A lot of people will probably pile on here saying that crypto wont go to zero, but factually there is only one use for blockchain technology right now and that would be a CBDC. CBDC would not have anything to do with the current coins which are being treated as ponzi schemes, and would not be related to the likes of tether or USDC. As matter of fact tether and USDC would likely stop existing as liquidity for them would dry up in an event where there is no coins to gamble on outside of them.

Is the next great financial crisis going to play out something like this? and when will it occur? Historically in great bubbles they were nearing an end when political figures were stoking the fire for personal gain. It is not hard to see this playing out right now. A lot of people find comfort that there is greater acceptance of crypto, but in fact it is a sign that the party is nearing its end. History rhymes.

EDIT: I have responded a lot in here, I think that I have clarified a few things with people and would like to change my wording above.

**Key Takeaways**

* Nvidia's scheduled earnings Wednesday highlight the tech financial reports calendar this week, along with quarterly updates from Salesforce, Marvell Technologies, Dell, and HP. Other noteworthy reports expected include retailers Costco, AutoZone, and Dick’s Sporting Goods.
* Friday’s PCE inflation report will provide insight into price pressure in April, while investors will also be following updates to first-quarter GDP, the U.S. trade balance, and consumer confidence.
* Federal Reserve officials set to speak this week include Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller and New York Fed President John Williams, coming as the Fed is scheduled to release the minutes from its May meeting.

Nvidia (NVDA) earnings and a key inflation report highlight this week’s holiday-shortened calendar as investors continue to evaluate the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and economic policies.

Tech companies Salesforce (CRM), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Dell Technologies (DELL), and HP (HPQ) are expected to deliver earnings this week. Market watchers will also be looking for reports from retailers Costco Wholesale (COST), AutoZone (AZO), Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS), and Temu parent PDD Holdings (PDD).

The reports are set to arrive after a down week for stocks, which was punctuated Friday by a revival of trade-related uncertainty. You can recap last week's trading here.

In addition to Friday's personal consumption expenditures inflation report on Friday, investors will also be tuned into first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) updates and the latest data on the U.S. trade balance and retail inventories. Consumer confidence and sentiment surveys also will be in focus.

Several Fed officials are on the speaking calendar, including Federal Reserve Gov.",7347,True,1748178984.0,2025-05-25 15:16:24,67,4,callsonreddit,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kv2as8/what_to_expect_in_the_markets_this_week_may_2730/,True,0.91,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1kvcs9x,,TSLA vs. BYDDY – Which EV Stock Is the Better Bet Right Now?,"Let’s keep it real  Tesla’s got the hype, but BYD is quietly crushing it

Yeah, Tesla’s talking a big game with Full Self-Driving, robotaxis, and household robots. Cool stuff, but it's all *future*. Meanwhile, their core EV business? Slipping. Q1 deliveries were the worst in over two years (337k), and they’re losing global market share. Stock's riding on promises

Then there’s BYD. Not as flashy, but they’re dominating China 34% of the NEV market in 2024, $107B in revenue (more than Tesla!), and some insane charging tech (250 miles in 5 minutes?!). Plus, their cars are affordable. Under $10K for an EV? That’s game-changing

Sure, BYD isn’t as far along with FSD, but they’re investing $14B into making smarter cars. And the stock’s trading at a sane valuation (under 27x earnings). Tesla? Still moon-high

Bottom line: If you’re betting on wild future tech, TSLA might be your pick.

Next are v3 and v4 250kw Superchargers. These can charge non-Teslas if you have an adapter and Tesla's permission. Jeep does not right now.

The final class are v4 supercharger with an embedded adapter. Any EV can use these.

The final group is the only one that you can use.

The charging universe is not only Tesla. EVGo and electrify America have been on the scene for awhile. Lately I've been using Rivian Adventure Network chargers. Start with a tap of a credit card and super fast.

Just look for other chargers too is my advice. Use plugshare.com to search for chargers in the area where you are going.

post,1kw2152,,"Data after 50,000+ miles across a Bolt EUV and a Tesla Model 3","I have a separate meter for my 2023 Tesla Model 3 RWD that I use to track energy use, efficiency, cost (and cost-savings), etc., and compare back to very detailed data I kept on my previous ICE car. 

Given I've now driven >30,000 miles, it felt like a good time to share the data and because I had it, I also shared comparisons to the Bolt EUV. 

|Measure|2023 Tesla Model 3 RWD|2022 Bolt EUV FWD|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Miles**|30,499|19,912|
|**Total kWh**|9,028|6,547|
|**Wh/Mi; Mi/kWh; MPGe**|296; 3.38; 114|329; 3.04; 103|
|**Average Temp**|49F|52F|
|**Savings ; Tax**\*\*\*|$2,076.44; $437.37|$1,454.89; $279.50|

**SAVINGS**  
*\*I benchmarked the fuel costs associated against my prior car, a Toyota Corolla which got 33.17 mpg over the 100,000+ miles I tracked it, and I also benchmarked against current gas prices, which in my area have been roughly $3/gallon but I am using nuanced* [*monthly averages for my state*](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM_EPMRU_PTE_NUS_DPG&f=W)*. I also bake in a $30 oil change per 5,000 miles as ""fuel"".* 

*\*\*I also calculated the portion of my savings that is due to taxes I'm not paying at the pump (0.285+0.184 per gallon) - which is relevant politically given we can expect a $250/year EV surcharge to attempt to ""close that loophole"", which for me, looks to be ""fair"" if it were state + federal, but just being federal and* combine*d with my state's surcharge ($75), it is not.* 

I have insurance, tabs, depreciation, maintenance, as well but wanted to focus on ""fuel"". Those costs are all higher than the Corolla due to the Tesla (and Bolt) being much newer cars (and fully insured instead of minimally insured) and the heightened costs do offset the fuel-savings for now. I'll be curious to see over 100,000+ miles how the total cost to own tightens up and I expect the Tesla to win out.

post,1kwjdmm,,TSLA: Why I'm still bullish despite the EPS nosedive,"Been holding TSLA since 2021 and just watched their recent earnings with mixed feelings. While everyone's freaking out about the 53% EPS drop, I've been trying to make sense of why the stock is still up 37% over the same period. Either I'm missing something or the market is.

My position: 120 shares @ $187 average (up about 81% total)

The Q1 earnings were objectively bad

EPS of $0.27 vs expected $0.41 (missed by 34%)

Factory changeovers for Model Y killed production numbers

Automotive margins down to 19% from previous highs in the mid-20s

Musk sounding increasingly distracted on the call

Yet I'm still holding and even added 15 shares on the post-earnings dip. Here's why:

The energy business is quietly becoming a monster

While everyone obsesses over car deliveries, Tesla's energy storage business hit record gross profit with 26% margins. My brother works in commercial solar, and he says Megapack orders are backlogged for months. The margins here are substantially better than automotive, and it's growing faster.

The robotaxi bet could pay off big

I was skeptical about the robotaxi timeline until I saw the Austin test videos. If they actually launch paid rides next month as planned, it changes everything about the valuation model. Even if it's limited geographically, proving the technology works would be massive.

Optimus robot could be the sleeper hit

The Optimus humanoid robot is another wild card that could transform Tesla's business model. They're planning to have thousands of units in production by year-end, ramping to potentially a million units annually by 2030. Imagine having one of these handling household chores, elder care, or factory work.

post,1kwrt8l,,New 3-row EV comparison,"Below is the summary by Google NotebookLM

* **Kia EV9**
   * **Price:** Starts at $54,900, or basically $55,000, making it the cheapest and best value vehicle in the three-row segment. The as-tested price of the specific model shown was just over $70,000, around $72,000. You can get the Land trim with a large battery pack and dual motor for this price. Leasing is also mentioned as very cheap, around $299 per month with about $2500 down (taxes included in Colorado).
   * **Range:** The video mentions the EPA rated range is put up. The large battery pack is almost 100 kilowatt hours. The range is described as ""not all that much,"" just under 100 kilowatt hours, but considered an ""easy justification"" for the price.
   * **Charging Performance:** Charging performance is noted as being good due to its EGMP platform. The peak charging speed is about 220 kW briefly, but most of the time it's about 200 kW, and it holds this speed deep into the pack, sitting at just about 200 kW up to 80%. This makes it an amazing charging vehicle for road trips. However, it's the only vehicle in the comparison that doesn't natively interface well with the Tesla Supercharger network, getting a maximum of 84 kW currently, though this is expected to increase to 125 kW for model year 2026. It uses an onboard booster for Supercharging and can be buggy.
* **Cadillac Vistic**
   * **Price:** Described as ""quite a bit more money than the Kia,"" starting around $80,000 base, with the as-tested model around $84,000. Higher trims can go up to $100,000.
   * **Range:** Shares the Lyric battery, which GM quotes as 102 kilowatt hours capacity, though it's closer to 105-106 kWh. The battery capacity is only about 10 to 20 kWh more than the smaller Equinox and Optic, which feels like a lot of money for the battery size in a large car.

No Apple, Amazon, or Tesla which are too consumer facing. Have the AI tech behemoths, which are also the true quantum plays. Have insurance companies, contrarian bets, mix of mid cap growth companies which have proven themselves with continuously strong earnings reports, and few crazy growth stories.

**The Rules**: DCA daily, when fear and greed index dumps below 25 then aggressively DCA even lump sum. If a company has more than 2 bad earnings more-so guidance than they're out.

**Good Time To Buy?**: I believe they're all overpriced right now. Will hedge with UVXY calls buying monthlies, selling against the position creating diagonals at various strikes when there's an upcoming binary event which could be negative catalyst.

**Changes This Time**: Am combining timing the market increasing DCA'ing amounts, actively managing based off of ER's/guidance, and hedging against during drawdowns using longer dated uvxy calls.

I think this is the real kicker here. 

While the sales decline worldwide (especially in the US) has *some* to do with Elon's salute and his time at Doge,  I think other factors have contributed much more to it. Tesla's sales have been shrinking for the past two years.

A very limited and aging lineup, 3/5 of which are out of the reach of the average person has played a big role. More people want SUVs over sedans, so Tesla is effectively competing with just one model. I don't think the refresh was significant enough for people to want to upgrade.

I too believe that nobody thinks of them as the technology leader anymore which is why the competition has been able to gain a foothold. 

Their tech is still better than the competition in North America in the sense that everything just works and works seamlessly, lag free, but I don't think that's gonna cut it anymore.

I was really excited about the ID Buzz but I’ve realized it’s a failure in the US. Tried to capture why I think it’s failing - can informed folks please weigh in. 

1. Price. The higher trims hit mid $70K and there are just fewer customers in this segment (irrespective of brand, range etc). 
2. Range. For a car starting mid $60Ks, a range of 230 miles is just not acceptable. It’s off by a 100 miles actually. 
3. No incentives. Since this isn’t made in the U.S. Also no special lease deals in the U.S.  
4. Minivans are just not popular, especially compared to SUVs. Doesn’t matter how novel it looks. 
5. Marketing. Unfortunately, there is almost no effective marketing campaigns to promote the vehicle.

post,1kxu7oq,,First-Time EV Buyer's Guide,"I often help people on the weekly General Questions and Purchasing Advice thread, and have been thinking about doing something like this to compile my answers to common questions. I'm going to structure it like a guide for each part of the buying process, but it's more like a collection of my thoughts. I'd be happy to add to it if anyone has anything else to contribute! This is also US-centric (sorry). 

#The Starting Line
So you want to buy an EV eh? Awesome! The process is, in general, very similar to buying a standard internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, but with a few key additional areas of research. I'm going to assume you generally know the basics of ICE vehicle ownership, and make this guide as specific as possible the electric portion of the vehicle purchasing. 

Let me say this up top though if you are on the fence for an EV. If you can charge at home and have a two-car (or more) household, you 100% should make one of those cars an EV. You'll save money on gas and oil changes, and experience the convenience of leaving home with a full ""tank"" every morning. You can get a used Chevy Bolt or Tesla for less than $10k almost anywhere in the US if you qualify for the $4k tax credit, and they're great vehicles that can completely cover 99% of driving needs (and obviously there's plenty of vehicles at higher prices). If that's all you need to hear, go for it. 

# Assess your situation
As always you should buy a car that suits your needs. Trucks for construction work, vans for families, etc. EVs are no different, but you should ask yourself a few additional questions to determine which, if any, EV is right for you: 

* The first, most important question - do you have a place to charge? The main benefit EV owners cite is that the vehicle can ""refuel"" at home, every night. In contrast, the ""worst"" part of the experience is public charging.",15761,True,1748470421.0,2025-05-29 00:13:41,86,53,chilidoggo,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kxu7oq/firsttime_ev_buyers_guide/,True,0.95,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1kxwjdj,,Tesla investors demand Musk work 40-hour week at EV maker as ‘crisis’ builds,"Elon Musk needs to spend more time at Tesla as his electric vehicle company faces a “crisis,” according to a letter on Wednesday from a group of pension fund leaders who manage investments in the company.

“Tesla’s stock price volatility, declining sales, as well as disconcerting reports regarding the company’s human rights practices, and a plummeting global reputation are cause for serious concern,” the investors wrote in a letter to Robyn Denholm, the company’s board chair. “Moreover, many issues are linked to Mr. Musk’s actions outside of his role as Technoking and Chief Executive Officer at Tesla, including his high-profile role as an architect of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).”

The investors want the Tesla board to require Musk to work a minimum of 40 hours per week at the automaker as a condition of any new compensation plan they may arrange for him. They also want a clear succession plan for management of the EV business, and a policy that would apply to all Tesla directors limiting their outside board commitments at public and private companies.

Early last year, the Delaware Court of Chancery ordered Tesla to rescind Musk’s 2018 CEO pay package, which had been worth around $56 billion, finding that Musk controlled the company, and the board’s compensation committee misled shareholders before seeking their vote to approve the plan.

Musk now says he wants even more shares, amounting to 25% voting control of the company.

Tesla’s brand value and reputation have declined since 2024, due largely to Musk’s incendiary rhetoric and political activities. In addition to pouring nearly $300 million into an effort to get Donald Trump back into the White House, Musk formally endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party ahead of the country’s parliamentary election this year.

At DOGE, Musk has led an initiative by the Trump administration to slash federal agencies.",3951,True,1748476658.0,2025-05-29 01:57:38,313,51,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kxwjdj/tesla_investors_demand_musk_work_40hour_week_at/,True,0.94,2025,both,search,False,False,0,

We are thinking to get another tesla in the family and this time model Y. My brother bought model 3 last year and claimed ev tax credit and was making under 75k adjusted gross income.

comment,1kxxgm4,1kxxgm4,,"Let me get this straight:

* Your dad:
   * Intends to buy a used Tesla, 
   * Qualifies for the used EV tax credit,  
   * Wants to get the used EV tax credit, and
   * Does not qualify to get a loan to buy a Tesla.
* You and your brother:
   * Intend to put your names on the loan so your dad can get the loan and 
   * Do not qualify for the used EV tax credit.

Your question is, ""Will putting your name and your brother's name on the loan and (I presume) any title documents cause any problems with your dad getting the tax credit?"" 

Answer: probably not.  

As far as the IRS is concerned, it seems as though only the person the dealer reports to the IRS as the buyer needs to qualify for the used tax credit.  The IRS doesn't exactly say this, but here are the clues:

In [IRS FS-2024-26, page 4, A11](https://www.irs.gov/pub/taxpros/fs-2024-26.pdf#page=4), the IRS mentioned multiple people getting the *new* EV tax credit:

>The name and taxpayer identification number of the owner claiming the New Clean Vehicle Credit should be listed on the seller’s report. See Topic B, FAQ 9. Accordingly, multiple owners of a new clean vehicle should inform the seller which owner will claim the New Clean Vehicle Credit so that the seller can identify that taxpayer on the seller’s report. **The credit would be allowed only on the tax return of the owner listed in the seller’s report.",3559,True,1748482402.0,2025-05-29 03:33:22,3,0,SirMontego,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kxxgm4/cosign_on_used_ev_credit/mut2xr0/,True,,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,mut2xr0

post,1kyaiiu,,(05/29) Tariffs and Teslas and Takeovers!,"NVDA is the most interesting stock today.

Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

The court stated they lacked a valid national emergency justification and infringed upon congressional powers. We saw a huge move in the market afterhours yesterday, mainly interested to see if we can continue the move. Is the tariff madness over? Absolutely not, but I'm interested in seeing if we keep momentum upwards.

comment,1kxu7oq,1kxu7oq,,"I do think we have to address the budget buyer use case too. The used market for EV is strong and getting stronger, as EV owners turn over to their 2nd (or 3rd) EV purchases. 

Used 1st(ish) generation EVs are getting quite affordable. Obviously check the model or brand specific subreddit for common issues, but a used EV is a great value, even with nominal battery degradation. 

As an example, I was shopping for a new commuter car and I wanted an EV. I wanted a small, efficient EV that didn’t look ridiculous. I also didn’t want to spend $25k - $50k for a new car that would depreciate as soon as I signed the paperwork. 

I didn’t need a lot of range, since it’s going back and forth to work and around town. Automated driving was a low priority, because I actually like to drive, though some enhanced safety features are fine. Similarly, have the ability to use DCFC in a pinch was good, but I didn’t need huge max DC speed. 

After looking at leafs, ford focus EVs, miniEVs, and others, I zeroed in on the e-Golf. The 2017-20 versions have DCFC and a “larger” battery that gets over 125mi in EPA and real-life driving in good weather. Some also have heat pumps for HVAC that help mitigate winter losses, though at the cost of a potential failure point.

post,1kyk96u,,Wall connector: NACS or Universal,"Hey there,
I have a 26 Juniper and 21 Bolt. Obviously, different connectors for charging with NACS and J1772. 

I moved recently and to have a new plug installed outside with my Grizzl-E’s NEMA 14-50 is not recommended without a GCFI breaker. I have decided to sell the Grizzl-E and purchase a Tesla wall connector. 

I regularly charge my Bolt at Superchargers with a A2Z EV CCS1 to NACS connector and also own a A2Z EV NACS to J1772 connector. 

Which way do you think I should go?

1. Tesla Wall Connector with NACS only and then use the A2Z adapter with the Bolt. 
2. Tesla Universal Wall Connector with NACS and J1772. 

Cost difference is $420 vs $650.

post,1kyl4rv,,Question about Tesla Cars,"Hello,

I’d like to start this off by saying that I have this problem where people keep hitting my car. Doesn’t matter if I’m stopped at a red light or just driving in my own lane. Somehow, people keep hitting me. I haven’t been at fault for any of these incidents so far. I’m pretty fed up with this because I’ve had my car for less than one year and it has been hit three times. I don’t even live in a big city. 

So, my question is: will a Tesla alert me if another car makes contact with mine, even if it’s just a really small bump? 

In one of the incidents I had, I was on a busy highway, stopped at a red light. I noticed the person behind me was super close to me but my car didn’t move and I didn’t hear a sound (my window was down) so I drove off. Later I checked and there was a dent in my car where the person hit me.

Do you guys think a Tesla would “help” me with this issue? I just want it to alert me even if the other car barely touched mine.

post,1kyld3i,,New vehicle purchase - check my gas/kWh math please,"TLDR: upgrading from a 35mpg (city) 2nd gen Prius to PHEV or EV, think either one will save us in the long run as gasoline costs increase here in California, but based on my math it is not looking feasible. I need some input if my math needs to account for other factors. 

For context, my wife has a 2007 Prius that's reliable but showing its age. Haven't done much highway driving lately but have been tracking the last few fuel purchases of mostly city driving and it seems to be getting about 35mpg lately. Regular 87 octane is holding at around $4/gallon. So approx 11.4 cents per mile for fuel only (not including maintenance, etc).
Central Valley CA. We are expected to see gas in the $6-8 range within the next 2 years due to refineries shutting down permanently, unless there is some course correction with the political winds.

Our goal in a new vehicle is to upgrade from what we currently have and have a vehicle that is good for long trips. We think PHEV is the ideal candidate. It would allow efficient daily commute use, but still have the engine and tank to take us anywhere on longer trips like we currently use her car or my truck (400-500 mile range) without having to deal with the range anxiety or charging times of a full EV. 

I'm learning to look past the MPGe number and look more closely at the specs, since MPGe is an average formula based on average driver use case scenario. 
Learning to ask: what is the MPG of the gas powertrain that will take us on longer trips, and what is the kWh/100 mile number.

Example a new Kia Sorento or Sportage PHEV have 31/34 miles of EV range respectively, and approx 34-36mpg gas, but a Mazda CX90 has 26 miles of battery range and only gets 26mpg gas. These are just a few PHEV models we have considered. 
Digging deeper, the kWh/100 mile ratings:
Kia Sportage PHEV 40
Kia Sorento PHEV 45
Mazda CX-90 PHEV 58

We do not currently have solar, it is in the future plans, so for now just paying straight PG&E rates on a tiered rate plan.",3710,True,1748550691.0,2025-05-29 22:31:31,3,60,keepcalmandcarryone,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kyld3i/new_vehicle_purchase_check_my_gaskwh_math_please/,True,0.59,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1kylja5,,"⚡ PSA: Can’t Adjust Your Tesla Wall Connector Settings Anymore? Here's How To Fix It (Gen 3, 2025 Method)","**TL;DR:**  
Tesla seems to have quietly killed the web setup process for Wall Connectors. If you're stuck with the “Download the Tesla One App” message at [192.168.92.1](http://192.168.92.1), stop wasting time. Download the *Tesla One* app, select “External Partner,” enter your Wall Connector serial manually, and use Setup Mode (blinking green) to reconfigure your unit.

\--

Alright Reddit — if you’re trying to reconfigure your Gen 3 Tesla Wall Connector (like resetting it or changing the breaker size), and all you’re getting is the “Tesla One App – Partner Access Only” screen at [`http://192.168.92.1`](http://192.168.92.1), here’s what actually worked for me after way too much trial and error. Tesla has changed how commissioning works, and most of the info online is now outdated.

# What You’ll Need:

* Tesla One App (not the regular Tesla app)
* Wall Connector serial number (usually on the back of the unit, behind the cover)
* A Tesla account (yes, even if you don’t own a Tesla)
* Your Wi-Fi password
* A little patience

# Steps to Reset or Recommission:

1. Download the **Tesla One App**
2. Choose **External Partner** when prompted
3. Log in or create a Tesla account
4. Tap: *Installs → Continue → Go to Home*
5. Tap **Begin Install**
6. Choose **Enter Connector Info Manually**
7. Type in your unit’s serial number
8. Put your Wall Connector into setup mode by holding the charging handle button for \~6 seconds until the LED blinks green
9. Tap **Join** when prompted
10. Follow the rest of the prompts:

* Set country
* Adjust breaker size (e.g., 50A sets output to 40A)
* Connect to Wi-Fi

# Quick Note:

I’m not an electrician — just a guy trying not to burn down the garage. My setup was wired to code for a 60A breaker, pulling 48A no problem. But during the county inspection, the inspector flagged it and made us swap to a 50A breaker due to some old local rule about cable length and attic heat.",2283,True,1748551103.0,2025-05-29 22:38:23,29,18,Temporary_Spinach_74,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kylja5/psa_cant_adjust_your_tesla_wall_connector/,True,0.81,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1kyrdrn,,Thinking of buying a used Tesla — need input from long-time owners,"I recently test drove a few Teslas and instantly fell in love. Like many others have said, it completely changes how you view driving.

As much as I’d love to get a brand-new model (especially after experiencing HW4), my current financial situation only allows me to consider something from around 2018–2022 — ideally a 2019 or 2020 model.

So I have a few questions for those of you who own older Teslas:
	1.	Do you regularly use FSD (Full Self-Driving), or is it not really up to par with HW4, making you take over more often?
	2.	How many miles do you have on your car?
	3.	Is the claim that Tesla batteries can last up to 500k miles actually holding up for anyone here?

I know jumping into this might seem impulsive, but the experience genuinely changed my perspective — and the money saved on gas and oil changes is very appealing.

Do you think it’s too early for me to switch now, or should I just wait until I can comfortably afford a new model in 1–2 years?

Appreciate any honest input from experienced owners!",1021,False,1748566862.0,2025-05-30 03:01:02,0,8,L3THO,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kyrdrn/thinking_of_buying_a_used_tesla_need_input_from/,True,0.5,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,
