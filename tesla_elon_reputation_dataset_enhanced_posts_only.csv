post,9p819m,,Tesla Model X 1000 mile road-trip report,"I thought I‚Äôd write a review of a Tesla Model X for the sub from the perspective of a V8 loving petrolhead. There‚Äôs a lot of hate on here, and even more misinformation, so I thought I‚Äôd give the car a chance. 

I‚Äôve just spent 5 days with a 75D and done over 1000 miles. The car was a 2016 with Gen 1 Autonomous tech, 68,000 miles on the clock, and a 200 mile range battery. 

My last big drive was in a 3.0D Range Rover Velar, and the road-trip car before that was a Merc C63 AMG V8 Bi-turbo. I‚Äôve owned 15+ cars, many over 400bhp, and driven dozens more in Europe, UAE and the US. 

The car was booked through Turo. This was for a road-trip from Vegas to San Diego and back, so some days I was doing around 350 miles. Other days I started in the city center of SD and then drove to attractions in and outside the city. I covered all kinds of roads, but the vast majority were freeway and city driving. 

Originally I‚Äôd booked a BMW i8 to do the trip, but the car was apparently totaled two days before my booking, so the Model X was a last-minute alternative. I‚Äôm aware of how unreliable Turo bookings can be, so I had my eyes on a Tesla as a replacement in case of issues. 

---

**First the bad.** 

This car has a massive blind spot. Within 10 minutes of being in the car I was blasted with horn as I nearly wiped out some poor fucker in a SUV. It seems this blind spot exists when in Autopilot too, as it sometimes happened when the car was autonomously changing lanes. 

There‚Äôs a wonderful driver‚Äôs display that shows the car in relation to the lanes, the cars, trucks, and bikes around it. But the icons of passing cars only appear once they are a car-length in front of the Tesla. With the blind spot issue, it would be super duper useful if this showed cars beside the Model X! 

Anyway, I quickly came to respect the danger, and learned to not trust the mirrors or autopilot.",11257,True,1539858681.0,2018-10-18 12:31:21,6660,1560,[deleted],cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/9p819m/tesla_model_x_1000_mile_roadtrip_report/,True,0.91,2018,tesla,top,False,False,0,

> Elon Musk tweeted a complaint about Tesla‚Äôs share price that wiped $14bn off the company‚Äôs stock market value on Friday morning.

	Tesla did not immediately confirm whether Mr Musk‚Äôs tweet had been given legal clearance, and did not respond to a question about whether the company currently has a general counsel. Tesla lost three general counsels last year, one of them quitting after only two months.


	The Tesla boss, who has 33m followers on Twitter, issued his curt verdict on his company‚Äôs shares early in the morning in California on Friday, writing: ‚ÄúTesla stock price is too high imo.‚Äù

Within moments the Tesla share price started sinking, dropping 10 per cent over the course of an hour before recovering slightly. The sharp move comes in what has been a hugely volatile period for Tesla‚Äôs shares. They slumped more than 60 per cent after coronavirus hit, but then rebounded by 120 per cent.

People are comparing them to pets.com, but I don‚Äôt think even that company was this blatant at ripping investors off. Their ‚Äúquarterly report‚Äù might as well have been a fat middle finger to both their investors and the SEC.

Oh btw the company is worth around $15B... and some analysts are saying it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbuying opportunity‚Äù given today‚Äôs dip.

**Edit**: for more context on the Pets.com comparison:

Pets.com had annual revenue of $619k for first year, and reached a market cap of $400M at its highest. Crazy bubble right?

Well Nikola has annual revenue of less than $100k (maybe a bit more depends on how many more solar panels the CEO is gonna order for his houses lmao), but reached market cap of $30B at its highest.

It‚Äôs literally 500 times more overvalued than the most infamous bubble stock during the dotcom crisis.

**Edit 2**: For the people who argue how revenue doesn't matter because they are the next Tesla.

For comparison. Tesla was founded in 2003 and 5 years later the original Tesla Roadster was on sale. They didn't go IPO until 2 years after that. Elon Musk also had a decent track record, being a co-founder and CEO of this small startup called PayPal.

Meanwhile Nikola Motors was founded in 2004, by a businessman with no real education whose resume is ""fluffy"" at best, and their six years of ""industry leading product development"" has yielded some fantastic CG renderings. 

Can Nikola be the next Tesla? Never say never, especially in the year 2020. But my bet is that Trevor Milton is closer to Elizabeth Holmes than Elon Musk.

**Edit 3** Ahahahaha apparently Trevor gave out more update of their factory construction (remember production is supposed to start in 2021) at yesterday's quarterly call...and drum roll......

post,ipp3e9,,Don't be fooled. This IS The Market Crash: My DD.,"I've been researching this a LOT lately because I didn't want to get caught in it. Looking at trends and past data. I believe, strongly, that we're in the middle of the market crash. I used my knowledge and was able to fully exit my entire $500k portfolio on Tuesday, maintaining all my gains. I've even taken a sizeable position in SPY puts ($50k worth of Dec $260). I got my close friends out (well the ones who listened) on Friday at the first sign of positive movement.

First of all, a little history lesson on the [Minksy Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsky_moment#/media/File:Stylized_Minsky_Cycle.PNG). It's basically a theory for how market bubbles happen. It occurs in 5 steps. I will outline what they are in basic and how the current market looks in relation.

1. **Displacement**: This is the beginning of a new paradigm where the market changes in a big way. For this, that was the Coronavirus. This took place between February to April.
2. **Boom**: Increase in spending begins and major gains start to be made. Media attention and market involvement begin to increase. Currently, we've seen a HUGE increase in retail traders (who are extremely volatile) and massive media attention toward the stock market as it relates to corona news as well as stimulus and recovery speed gains. This took place between April and July.
3. **Euphoria**: People stop caring about any sort of reasonable investment strategy and just start throwing money at stuff. Tesla is a fantastic example of this, but many other stocks in the tech sector are guilty of this. July was the beginning of this phase as Tesla saw insane growth within a few week period and other companies followed suit very quickly. This continued into late August with Apple and Tesla going to stupid prices after their splits, and all the other big tech names reaching wild valuations.
4. **Profit Taking**: Smart money starts withdrawing funds from the market as they prepare for the crash.",13162,True,1599685339.0,2020-09-09 23:02:19,7748,1650,[deleted],stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ipp3e9/dont_be_fooled_this_is_the_market_crash_my_dd/,True,0.88,2020,tesla,top,False,False,0,
post,j59ovh,,So Tesla's quality control is embarrassingly bad. Our brand new model Y's roof just fell off,"My dad bought a brand new model Y today, and he brought me along to pick it up just in case he needed help with any tech problems. Everything was going fine and we were driving back home when we started to hear a ton of wind. I thought maybe a window was open but a minute later the entire glass roof just blew off. After a brief panic we turned around and drove the new Tesla convertible back to the dealership.

When we got back we called highway patrol to tell them that there was a car roof somewhere on the 580, but somebody might have gotten into an accident, I‚Äôm not sure. The manager at the dealership said that either the seal for the roof was faulty, or the factory just ... forgot to seal the roof on? I can‚Äôt imagine how something as big as the roof not being attached could make it past quality control. If this is a recurring problem a lot of people could get hurt. Has this ever happened before?

&#x200B;

Edit: The manager offered to get the car serviced for free, but we declined and are probably going to get an entirely new car. Whether we're still getting a Tesla is up to my dad but probably not.

post,kpeffw,,Reasons We May Not Be in a Bubble,"I'm seeing a lot of posts comparing this to the 2000 dot-com bubble. Here's a breakdown of why we're likely not anywhere close to 2000 levels of craziness.

**First:**  During the dot-com era, the Nasdaq Composite's price-to-earnings valuation ran up as high as 200. By comparison, the index's P/E today is a relatively tame 28, only modestly higher from 23 at the end of 2019. 

**Second:** Interest rates were a very attractive 6% which provided a strong alternative to stocks. No such outlet exists today unless you trust bitcoin, or want to invest in paper gold.

**Third:** Much of the value gains we're seeing in the market can be tied directly to the fact that people who invest are making similar or better money this year, and spending significantly less causing them to save more and invest more:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html)

**Fourth:** The rest of the growth can largely be attributed to increased liquidity from all of the money printing. Stocks tend to mirror an increase in the money supply with their value making them a great hedge against inflation. The valuations of the 2000s weren't backstopped by QE or increased savings, making them much shakier.

**Fifth:** The money printing will likely go on for a while. People mistakenly assume we're printing against our 22T dollar economy when we're really printing against the 80-100T global economy for which are the reserve currency. A weak dollar benefits the global economy, and benefits us because we are the trading floor for the global economy.

This is a long but very illuminating read on why QE is necessary and actually helpful:

post,l3z5jq,,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

post,lcftzc,,10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.

post,lm2mry,,"BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, is starting to ""dabble"" in Bitcoin","https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/blackrock-has-started-to-dabble-in-bitcoin-says-rick-rieder.html

BlackRock‚Äôs Rick Rieder told CNBC on Wednesday the world‚Äôs largest asset manager has begun entering the bitcoin space.

The remarks from Rieder, who is BlackRock‚Äôs chief investment officer of global fixed income, came on the same day bitcoin broke above $51,000 for the first time.

‚ÄúToday the volatility of it is extraordinary, but listen, people are looking for storehouses of value,‚Äù Rieder said on ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù ‚ÄúPeople are looking for places that could appreciate under the assumption that inflation moves higher and that debts are building, so we‚Äôve started to dabble a bit into it.‚Äù

In January, BlackRock added bitcoin futures as an potential investment for two of its funds, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The funds are BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities and BlackRock Global Allocation Fund.

A number of other financial institutions, such as BNY Mellon and Mastercard, have made entrances into the crypto space in recent days. BNY Mellon, the nation‚Äôs oldest bank, will launch a digital assets unit later this year, while Mastercard intends to support certain cryptocurrencies on its formal network.

Electric vehicle maker Tesla also announced last week it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin using cash on its balance sheet and intends to begin accepting the digital coin as payment for its products.

The price of bitcoin has risen more than 70% this year, adding to a major rally that began in the fall. ‚ÄúMy sense is the technology has evolved and the regulation has evolved to the point where a number of people find it should be part of the portfolio, so that‚Äôs what‚Äôs driving the price up,‚Äù Rieder said.

Despite bitcoin‚Äôs growing respectability as an asset class, Rieder said Wednesday that how much exposure an investor should have ‚Äúdepends on what the rest of your portfolio looks like.",2314,True,1613590487.0,2021-02-17 20:34:47,3644,1453,PZinger6,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lm2mry/blackrock_the_worlds_largest_money_manager_is/,True,0.97,2021,tesla,top,False,True,0,
post,lqfhuz,,Technology stocks are crashing ‚Äì what now,"A friend just messaged me saying that his portfolio lost 10% of its value recently and that this was complete doomsday. Judging by the futures, the NQ is down 6.8% from its highs (a 1.8% gap down this morning alone). I get that, it's frustrating.

It is also noteworthy that the sell-off hurts technology stocks in particular. But mind that they were also the largest beneficiary in recent months:

* Nasdaq 100 is 53% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* S&P 500 is 31% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* DJIA is 19% above its weekly 200 EMA.

Which one is going to be hurt first and foremost once a correction is underway? Of course it's going to be the most stretched industry sector. Information technology is 28% of the S&P 500, and 20% of the DJIA.

If you buy stocks, you've got to have conviction in them. You've got to know what you are buying. Am I going to dump all my holdings just because they're ""overvalued"". Of course not. I'm going to hang in there with stocks going down 30% and then come back up 80%. Even if that takes another 3 years. It's the nature of the market and it is great at weeding out the less convinced.

Volatility is the price you pay for your returns.

If you held Apple all these years, you are sitting on a fortune now. Same goes for Amazon and many other megabrands of today. Amazon went top to bottom 60% several times in its history. You've got to have conviction in what you're buying to hold onto such kind of volatility. I also go to the grocery store to pick my favorite marmalade brand. If there's a 30% discount I'll pile up. But you cannot ever pile up if you don't have conviction in your holdings in the first place.

So here's what I would do. Go through your portfolio name by name. Ask yourself why it's there in the first place. Start with ""I own XYZ because..."".

post,lt7oop,,JPMorgan advises clients to expose 1% of their portfolio to Bitcoin,"In a recent note to clients, strategists from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) suggested a one percent portfolio allocation to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

As reported by Bloomberg, JPM strategists Joyce Chang and Amy Ho opined that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against fluctuations from traditional assets like bonds, stocks, and commodities. However, they advised clients to allocate a small percentage due to the risk of major downturns in Bitcoin‚Äôs value.

After setting a new all-time high above $58,000, the value of the digital asset slumped to less than $45,000 and has been struggling to recover ever since.

Chang and Ho told investors:

>*In a multi-asset portfolio, investors can likely add up to 1% of their allocation to cryptocurrencies in order to achieve any efficiency gain in the overall risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio.*

Bitcoin has welcomed major investments from the likes of Paul Tudor Jones, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and MicroStrategy. The endorsement from JPM comes at a time when institutional players are rushing to accumulate the digital asset. As per Bloomberg‚Äôs report, America‚Äôs oldest bank BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has also announced plans to enable Bitcoin transactions for its clients.

The strategists were quick to add that cryptocurrencies should be viewed as an investment vehicle and opposed to being funding currencies like the USD or EUR. This appears to be contrary to earlier statements from other JPM analysts that called cryptocurrencies the ‚Äúpoorest hedge for major drawdowns in equities.‚Äù

https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/softbank-says-unaware-of-sec-probe-into-securities-trading

On Wednesday, short seller research site PlainSite posted a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter revealing that the agency is investigating SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications company and investing giant notorious for financing various unprofitable ‚Äútechnology‚Äù companies like WeWork, Uber, Compass, and Oyo.

Aaron Greenspan, founder of the Think Computer Foundation that runs Plainsite, filed a FOIA request in December 2020 for ""any investigative materials [from January 1, 2018 to the present] pertaining to the various SoftBank companies controlled by Masayoshi Son, specifically relating to SoftBank's trading of stocks and derivatives on those stocks.""

This request was filed in response to the revelation last fall that SoftBank was the ""Nasdaq whale.‚Äù SoftBank was responsible for stoking a huge rally in tech stocks, the Financial Times reported, because around August it began buying billions of dollars worth of call options in a shift for the company, fueling a rally that pushed up the share prices of tech companies it held billions of dollars of equity in.

Thanks in large part to a rally sparked by SoftBank‚Äôs high-risk market plays, firms like Tesla and Apple were up 74 and 21 percent, respectively, in the month of August alone. Executed through a small desk of traders and chief executive Masayoshi Son himself, the trading unit‚Äïnamed SB Northstar‚Äïand its bets won the company some $4 billion in gains at the beginning of September, before quickly melting away into nearly $3 billion in losses by the end of the month.

In a January letter responding to Greenspan‚Äôs initial request, and months after the reporting on Softbank became public, the SEC said that its search did not turn up any relevant records.",3308,True,1616645951.0,2021-03-25 05:19:11,3379,340,rrdonoo,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mcpqqp/the_sec_confirms_it_is_investigating_softbank_for/,True,0.99,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,

post,n6dh3d,,I sold every share I own today.,"I got into the market last year post Covid around May or June. Since then it has been an absolute rollercoaster trying to pick stocks. I was up 100% on multiple stocks including Tesla, Carvana, Square, Fiverr. I didn't sell because you're supposed to hold for the long term I heard, only for those stocks and others over many months to drop 30% - 80% or more. I bought some new stocks in February only for them to then drop 30% or more in a matter of months. I have spent months this year and last inside on beautiful days going cross eyed staring at charts trying to figure out what stock to buy, what to sell, why this stock is going up, why this stock is going down. As we speak I'm sitting inside on a beautiful day writing this. I have admitted to myself I don't understand stocks. I don't understand businesses. I have reached a point where I stopped caring about losing money. That's a dangerous road I'm sure. With the amount of stocks I've bought and sold, I don't know if I'm up or down.

Evidence I don't understand stocks is that today Twitter is worth less than it was in 2013 when it IPO'd. One of the most popular social media apps in the entire world I would have assumed would be worth something. Apparently not. It may seem I'm impatient or have a short term horizon for the market, but if I bought Twitter in 2013, I would have wasted 8 years of my life holding it.

PLTR backed by Peter Thiel and signing multi-million dollar contracts week after week, well the bottom just fell out. While it will probably go back up, I don't understand when and why it would. If a company with that much growth potential can't go up, what chance does anything else have.

10 months ago I bought DKNG at $25 and sold a few months later for about $50. Today it's worth a little more than was 10 months ago. I'm glad I got out when I did.

$101 million (23%) of that came from selling Bitcoin for profit.

The other interesting part is that it would have been an earnings miss without the trading.

Did one make the other happen?

Considering the recent news about not allowing Bitcoin anymore, it's certainly a move worth mentioning.

Joe Biden has signed an executive order that bans American entities from investing in dozens of Chinese companies with alleged ties to defense or surveillance technology sectors.

In a move that his administration says will expand the scope of a legally flawed Trump-era order, the US treasury will enforce and update on a ‚Äúrolling basis‚Äù the new ban list of about 59 companies.

It also bars buying or selling publicly traded securities in target companies, and replaces an earlier list from the defense department, senior administration officials told reporters.

The order prevents US investment from supporting the Chinese military-industrial complex, as well as military, intelligence, and security research and development programs, Biden said in the order.

‚ÄúIn addition, I find that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside [China] and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constitute unusual and extraordinary threats,‚Äù Biden said.

A White House fact sheet on the order said the policy would take effect for those companies listed on 2 August.

Major Chinese firms included on the previous defense department list were also placed on the updated list, including Aviation Industry Corp of China (AVIC), China Mobile Communications Group, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC).

SMIC is key to China‚Äôs national drive to boost its domestic chip sector.

What benefit is there to having such a low number of employees? Lower costs yes but with the money they control and need to invest surely it would make sense for them to have more than just 13 employees doing this?

Or is it because it's easier for them to conceal fraud when there's only a handful of people being exposed to it and most of them have a large interest in keeping the fraud going.

Net net, I‚Äôm up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I‚Äôd lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. 

These are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.

**Understand the Trading Environment**

One mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.

**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can‚Äôt stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. 

In between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that‚Äôs more likely to pull back.  It‚Äôs also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).

post,qmjr7o,,"Tesla sells 1% of cars globally, yet is priced more than the companies combined that sell the other 99%","The valuation on Tesla is now beyond the absurd.  

Whilst European EV sales explode to presently 19% of all car sales this year, Tesla does not even make the top five EV sellers by company at a lowly 7%. (VW 25%; Stellantis 13%; Daimler 10%; BMW 10%; Hyundia-Kia 9%).

Tesla, unlike in the US, is simply being outsold by the vast array of alternative BEV models on sale particularly.  VW group alone offers the e-up, ID3 and ID4 (ID5 not yet on sale); Audi e-tron, e-tron Sportback e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT; Cupra Born; and Skoda Enyaq

In China Tesla has been pushed into 3rd place this year by BYD which has seen EV sales grow from 53K Q1; 98K.Q2; 183K Q3.  Tesla meanwhile has seen China quarterly sales for 2021 flattish at 69K, 62K and 75K.  China will likely sell 3 million EV's this year, half the worlds volume and Tesla sales are flat for the year.  Tesla might sell a lowly 9%.

Tesla dominates the US markets of course, where few EV models are on sale.  EV sales might be 3% of automotive sales.

Whilst investors will assert these stats do not.matter and Tesla's valuation is all about  tech, batteries and robo-taxis, it still does not sell any car related tech beyond its own cars.  Take up of FSD is a lowly 11%.  It still buys it's battery cells.  By its own statements it has a level 2/3 driver assist whilst companies like Waymo are already starting to offer level 4/5 robo-taxis in cities like San Fran (a free trial program has commenced).

With Tesla slipping badly in the two biggest and mature EV markets globally, it's EV mkt share has fallen from near 18% highs in 2019 to 14.7% YTD in 2021.  With Europe and China likely to see 20% EV sales, the Tesla domination of global car mkts story is looking utterly flawed, yet its market capitalisation is now than the entire companies combined that sell 99% of cars and are adding EV's faster.

This is a post about a complete lack of customer service. 

I preordered a Model 3 LR three months ago. I was given a delivery window of Mid November to mid December. I got a message last week saying it was my turn to pick up my car. Sweet. They give me a choice of three days on their website to pick up the car. November 24, 25, 26. I find it a bit odd that thanksgiving they are open but I'm working on the 24th and the 26th and on such short notice I can't get out of work. So I put down delivery for the 25th. After all other stores are open on thanksgiving and the site blacked out other dates. 

I get messages from Tesla that I need to get my car insurance and pay the down payment or I won't be able to get the car. No problem. 

I pay the down payment via their app and get the insurance. I upload the proof to their app. All good. 

Then yesterday on 11/22/2021 I get a phone call at 3 pm saying that I can no longer pick up the car on 11/25 because they aren't actually open. 

Uh ok. So you tell me this after I put down the down payment and pay for the insurance. I'm a little pissed at this point but I get it. Let me pick it up another day then. And why didn't you tell me sooner?

They would only let me pick the 24th or 26th. That's it. I asked them can I pick up the car on December 2nd because I have work and can't reschedule or get someone to cover me on such short notice. Their response is ""no, we can't hold the car that long. We will give your car to someone else and you can wait another 3-4 weeks for another car to come in.""

The heck? They made the mistake. Took my money. Made me buy insurance for a car that I don't actually have and then they try to bully me into a specific delivery date on short notice? That's not fair. 

To make matters worse I try to post my story to r/teslamotors and it gets automatically deleted. I appealed it to a mod and he says ""This is not high quality content.",2484,True,1637698457.0,2021-11-23 21:14:17,13605,1579,[deleted],electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/r0m3yh/i_regret_buying_a_tesla_and_i_havent_driven_a/,True,0.93,2021,both,top,False,False,0,

post,rxqpdy,,How long can a Tesla survive stranded on a freeway in the winter? I did the math to find out.,"After reading the Washington Post article about electric cars being unsuitable when stranded on a freeway in the winter, I decided to do an experiment to find out the truth.

**The Scenario**

* My Model X was fully preconditioned prior to the start of the test
* The battery was charged to 80% prior to the start of the test
* Temperatures here in Michigan today were very uniform.  20 degrees all day.
* After preconditioning, the Model X was parked in my driveway for the test period
* Seat heaters, and steering wheel heaters were activated.  
* Cabin temp set to 70 degrees.  HVAC on Auto mode.
* Camp Mode was started, and the car was left in the driveway for the test period
* Vehicle doors will remain closed during the test period.  Mobile App used to acquire data every hour.
* Test duration:  5 hours

**The Raw Data**

* 79% - 207 miles - 11:45am - **Test Start**
* 76% - 201 miles - 12:53pm
* 74% - 196 miles  - 1:46pm
* 69% - 181 miles - 3:48pm
* 67% - 175 miles - 4:45pm - **Test End**

**The Results**

* Model X used an average of 2.4% of battery per hour throughout the test period
* Range went from 207 miles, to 175 miles at the end of the test.
* 5 hours of Camp mode utilized‚Ä¶
   * 32 miles of range
   * 12 % of range
* 24 hours of Camp Mode would require (extrapolated)‚Ä¶
   * 153 miles of range
   * 58% of range

This data conclusively proves that a Model X can easily keep all passengers in complete comfort during a 24 hour duration event while stranded on the freeway in the winter, using less than half of the maximum battery capacity.  All the while, the passengers have access to Netflix, video games, and plenty of online entertainment.

&#x200B;

Next step - I might re-run this same test tomorrow with my Model S.

**EDIT:**  It's going to be a bit colder on Friday, but I'm thinking about running the test again on the Model X with a 50 degree interior temperature, and running the original test (70 degree interior) on my Model S.",2034,True,1641507810.0,2022-01-06 23:23:30,1182,343,TheGadgetGuy1,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/rxqpdy/how_long_can_a_tesla_survive_stranded_on_a/,True,0.97,2022,tesla,top,False,False,0,

post,t44pro,,Ukraine supplies 70% of the world's neon. Chip makers are on edge.,"Again, the world's major chip and semiconductor companies are watching the conflict closely as the Russian invasion of Ukraine will likely hamper the supply of neon.

Neon is used in lithography to make microchips.

Currently it appears the larger chip manufacturers have plenty in reserve but are worried that if the conflict escalates or is prolonged then again, the industry will suffer as a whole.

I‚Äôve really enjoyed driving it. But the gap is quickly closing, and some of the design decisions and manufacturing makes me scratch my head.

The ‚Äúashamed‚Äù part, however, stems from the leader of the organization. He has become so polarizing that I can‚Äôt even have a conversation with people I meet regarding my Tesla without his name coming up. It makes me feel like people are looking at me as if I share his views because I own one. I wish he would just fade into obscurity with his billions and call it a win.

post,194ajsm,,My Tesla with a drivable 2000 to 4000 solar array,"I've been a long time reader, but not poster. For the last two years I've been working on a 2000 watt to 4000 watt solar system for my Model Y -- Today I can charge anywhere in the world!

I can reliably get 20 miles to 60 miles per day. I can expand these solar panels with ease, and contract them when I want to start driving.

I've also decided to put all the 3D printed parts required to build this online at [dartsolar.com](https://dartsolar.com) \-- if you want me to build you one, or if you want to get the free 3D parts and the blueprints for this build enter your email in the green box on the link.

The reason I can pack so many solar panels is because I am using telescoping carbon fiber tubes as my mechanism of expansion and contraction, as opposed to mechanical sliders. This allows me to pack 4000 watts of solar on a Tesla, without going over the max roof weight capacity of 165 lbs.

Overall it has been a fun project so far and I am designing Beta2. Beta1 is 11 inches high and is made out of wood. Beta2 will be fully made of carbon fiber and will be 6 inches high. Right now I researching the DC-to-DC charging and hot wiring.

Thank you all for your inspiration by sharing and discussing all things Tesla, **and of course ask me anything in the comments** and I'll reply shortly.

post,1b5o2uy,,Tesla hate is real,"After driving ICE cars that belonged to my parents or relying on public transport for the past years I decided after finishing my studies and getting a job I decided to buy my first own car. After taking into account costs + fun drive + luxury I decided an electric car would be the right option. Settled for a Tesla Model Y and am super happy. 
I obviously told my friends and family and damn  never expected such a negative reaction. 

I know there was a negative stigma around them but  literally from work, friends and family everybody was just criticizing my decision.
Instead of being happy for me or at least only mildly cricising due not having an electric car before I got comments like what a bad decision, never would buy electric, car will be worth 0 in 3 years, laughing about it being stupid, never able to take a long trip, charging on roadrips for hours with no range, etc. 

I couldn‚Äôt even argue with them and present my facts everybody just straight up was condescending and didn‚Äôt change their opinion. Yesterday another friend found out and said: ‚ÄûA Tesla/electric car driver will not be allowed to step into my car‚Äú lol

I don‚Äôt expect a reply but I know you will see this. Jeff will likely see it first and it‚Äôll make its way to one of you.  It sucks and it hurts. I do love this company but I messed up and I get it.  I enjoyed the ride and would gladly do it again.

Some ideas based on customer feedback 

DMV Test Mode- DMVs around the country are failing young drivers primary due to our exceptional one pedal driving. You could piggy back the brake burnish command with a different UI.  This would force the driver to use the pedal and then the instructors would have less to grip about. 

Drivers Ed Mode- create a program that teaches young drivers the rules of the road through a series of challenges.  In this mode the vehicle will set up routes based on the users progress through the training these routes would become more advanced. Make it into a ‚Äúsimulator‚Äù of sorts and they could even practice the basics while parked.  

So folks, let‚Äôs have it.  I‚Äôm still held to some NDAs but my experiences are mine.  I‚Äôll still gladly help you when and where I can. Hell I still believe in the brand, some adventures just have untimely endings.

post,1eimxw9,,"I tracked the price of 3000 used Teslas, here is what I found","I tracked the price of used cars listed on the Tesla website for the last 4 months. In total, I tracked \~3000 cars. I focused on cars listed in the San Francisco Bay Area. I used a linear regression model to determine what factors influence the price.

**Some insights:**

* Model Y and Model 3 cars are listed for 5 days on average before being removed/sold. Model X and S take a little longer, with an average of 7 days.
* Tesla automatically lowers the price if a car does not sell. On average the price decreased by $200 per day.
* 68% of all cars have basic Autopilot, 29% have FSD, 3% come with Enhanced Autopilot.
* 99% of eligible used cars include the Acceleration Boost option.

***Pricing factor estimates by model:***

**Model 3**

*Price reducing factors*

* $97 per 1000 miles driven
* $127 for each extra month in age
* $860 when previously repaired

*Model variants:*

* $3500 for Long range ($9000 new)
* $2300 performance version (new $7000)

*Premium options:*

* $1400 for EAP
* $2600 for FSD (new $8000)
* $90 for the white interior (new $1000)

Black ($221) and gray ($150) have a better resale value, compared to red (-$142), white (-$93) and blue (-$56).

No difference was found between 18 and 19 inch wheels ($1000 new)

**Model Y**

*Price reducing factors*

* $133 per 1000 miles driven
* $239 for each extra month in age
* $1600 when previously repaired

*Model variants:*

* $5500 for AWD ($3000 new)
* $3100 performance version (new $7000)

*Premium options:*

* $1900 for EAP

post,1f7a9i7,,Stranger blown away by FSD,"So I was activating a charger in a strip mall parking lot when a gentleman approached and started asking the usual EV questions.  ""Is it free to charge, how far does it go, how many chargers are there"". Years ago, these interactions were somewhat common, but as more and more people know about EVs,  it's not anymore. So it was a pleasant surprise, and I happily answered. 

Then he asked 'is this one of those self driving ones?'.

'yep, drove me here'

'no... It didn't actually?'

'yep' ... The look on his face was pessimistic so... 'if you have a few moments, hop on and see for yourself'. 12.3.6 is good, but it certainly has issues, but whatever, let's see what this random guy thinks...

He excitedly agrees, and we get in and I enter a random waypoint and let FSD pull out of the parking stall and off we go. I proactively mentioned it can be a bit silly in parking lots, and it certainly was very slow and cautious... But the guy was too blown away to care. As FSD turned onto public roads, and as it navigated the world around it, the amazement in this guy's eyes and voice grew by the moment. 

It was maybe a 10 minute drive, in mostly residential roads, but it was perfect. I didn't have to intervene once. Stops, yields, pedestrians and bikes, a car blocking the path while it turned around, fitting through narrow gaps due to parked cars and an oncoming big truck, slowing for speed bumps... And when it returned us to the parking lot, I selected a parking stall and it parked itself. 

The guy was losing his mind. He couldn't believe the car just drove him around. He was so awe-struck, so excited. He thanked me and then noticed his buddy, who was waiting for him... As he walked off with his friend, this 30ish year old guy was talking about his experience like a giddy school boy.

Sometimes it's nice to get an outsiders perspective on FSD. Sure, it wasn't the hardest route, but it was a random, real world route... And to this guy, it was magical.",2118,True,1725292645.0,2024-09-02 17:57:25,873,159,footbag,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1f7a9i7/stranger_blown_away_by_fsd/,True,0.93,2024,tesla,top,False,False,0,

post,1frg26x,,Rented a Model 3. I get why rental companies are dumping Teslas.,"Preface: I own a Model Y and I love it. Best car I've ever owned.

Had to go to Albuquerque for a short 2-day business trip. Rented a compact car from Budget. Guy asked how far I'd be driving, I said almost none, staying in airport area. He asked if he can give me a Tesla, I said sure. He told me it was a Y, but it was actually a RWD 3 with the LFP pack.

After getting in the car, ALL the settings were jacked up. Screen on Light rather than auto, headlights on rather than auto, climate manual not auto. Random safety features turned off. Autopilot set to TACC-only (although I get that). Sentry on. Bunch of other ones I forget, but I had to fix almost every setting. Luckily battery was at 98% so thats good. Unlike Hertz, Budget does not allow app connectivity, just the card.

I drove away and attended a meeting for a few hours. Came back out to the A/C humming away, I had missed the cabin overheat protection setting, it drained 10% of the battery in the hot New Mexico sun. Luckily I only used 20% of the battery my whole trip because I stayed pretty local. Car was also sort of janky: really bad wind noise/gap in driver window somewhere, and suspension felt a little rattle-y compared to my Y. Car had 21k miles. However I was impressed with the power of the RWD model. It's totally adequate, if not impressive.

Anyway, the ONLY reason I was able to navigate all this is because I own a Tesla and I know all this stuff. I cannot imagine any non-Telsa-owner being able to figure all this out and being happy with the experience. And I didn't even have to figure out how/where to charge it, that would be a whole other ball of wax for a new person. Beyond depreciation, I bet they've gotten tons of user complaints on these.

So that's my rant. Thanks for reading.",1777,False,1727535321.0,2024-09-28 16:55:21,1874,358,brunofone,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1frg26x/rented_a_model_3_i_get_why_rental_companies_are/,True,0.93,2024,tesla,top,False,False,0,

post,1gs3w77,,My Tesla with an expanding solar roof -- generates 4.5kwh per day,"Hello Reddit, this is an update of the last year worth of work on a personal project of mine -- placing an expandable solar array on my Tesla. And like all the past builds, the blueprints will be online for anyone to access. The last prototype Beta2 had lots of great feedback, and I am excited to share RC1 (Release Candidate 1). Officially the community is called [DartSolar](https://dartsolar.com) now, if you search online you can find our Reddit post from last year and all our blueprints.

https://preview.redd.it/wmzwpush541e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=08c6381084c14dc179fdd4d80426618f37c37d78

https://i.redd.it/ctxmyr9m341e1.gif

This is a 1kw solar array, composed of 6 smaller custom solar panels. These smaller solar panels are more serviceable, easier to replace, and makes it cheaper to fix. The roof rack uses custom made telescopic tubes make of aluminum (mostly), and some one segment made of stainless steel that I'm planning to replace with carbon fiber. However, when I release the blueprints I'll have the aluminum and carbon fiber specifications. You can get the blueprints of Beta2, and get these blueprints [here](https://dartsolar.com).

https://i.redd.it/aua77z4g441e1.gif

The entire design had to be aerodynamic af. I wanted no more than 2% aerodynamic drag loss. So I tested different designs on a 10-mile stretch where I would drive with the DartSolar on and off. The current model is about 1-inch tall, we created a custom made roof rack support to further decrease the height. Because the whole thing is flat we've observed 1% drag loss when driving at 30 mph, and about 2% when driving at 60 mph. In my daily commute I rarely go over 60 mph.

https://i.redd.it/77di9blfx31e1.gif

The solar panels are locked when driving by magnetic locks. That way they are very easy to open, but also the panels will not open when you're driving. In the blueprints I'll also add a mechanical lock to absolutely ensure the panels stay in place.",6071,True,1731697328.0,2024-11-15 20:02:08,888,225,somid3,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1gs3w77/my_tesla_with_an_expanding_solar_roof_generates/,True,0.94,2024,tesla,top,False,False,0,

post,1ie1jty,,Finally did it. Out with the Tesla.,"
Hey Everyone,

I have been a Tesla model y driver the last three years. My lease was up and due to recent developments with Elon and the staleness of having a Tesla (including a model 3 before) for the last 5 years; it was time for a change. 

Last night I made the jump and signed a lease of a 2024 Equinox EV 2RS all black. My lease isn‚Äôt up for a month and I just went to look and test drive anyway. I drove it and was blown away. It feels remarkably similar to my Dual Motor model Y but the interior quality was better. Loved every bit of it. It even has super cruise. The only option it‚Äôs lacking that I wish it had is the panoramic sunroof. 

I feel like I got a great deal (I negotiated pretty hard). 24 month lease with $315 per month lease with $0 down, 10,000 miles. All in all, spending $120 less per month than my Tesla. Very happy!

Trudeau elected to go ahead with retaliatory tariffs even though Trump‚Äôs order includes a mechanism to escalate the rates if Canada retaliates against the U.S.

post,1j7l0bv,,TSLA being investigated by Transport Canada for cooking their books in Canada to snag EV rebates without selling cars.,"The article notes that **four Tesla dealerships claimed to have sold 8,653¬†Teslas in 3 days.** Assuming each dealership opens from 9AM-5PM, that's **90 cars sold per hour per dealership**. Worth noting that Canada's EV rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how Tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did...

Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M.

I guess that's one way to maintain revenue while sales drop 90%!

Note: investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation of official wrongdoing yet.

Edit: Since this post got more attention then I expected. Yes I posted this Sunday and TSLA is currently down 13% today. However I do not think this is causing the drop, and rather it‚Äôs an overall market pull back from trade wars and from Europe sales declines. The article was published Friday morning and Tesla was up 3% by end of Friday.

I've been a fan of Elon for a very long time. I've read both biographies, watched easily \~80%+ of his interviews (there are a LOT out there now), and I resonate deeply with so much of how he thinks and what he does for the world.

That said, clearly, he's rubbed some people the wrong way.  
At the very least, there's a lot hatred being directed his way.

I'd love to explore this with people and help bridge what seems to be a growing divide.

I think the first step is by beginning to understand the people who do have hatred for Elon & Tesla, why that hatred is there?

I trust that more people than not genuinely want good things for the world, so I think we have that in common, and I'd like to build on that.

post,1jibfwl,,How to Balance a Fork Starship like Elon!,"Balancing silverware like Elon Musk, as seen in viral videos from events like the Mar-a-Lago dinner on March 15, 2025, involves understanding basic physics principles such as center of mass, weight distribution, and friction. While the exact method Musk used in those clips (e.g., balancing a fork and spoons on his finger or constructing a ""fork starship"") varies depending on the scenario, here‚Äôs a general guide to help you replicate a similar silverware-balancing trick:Steps to Balance Silverware

1. Choose Your Silverware: Start with a fork and a spoon, as these are common utensils Musk has been seen using. A fork‚Äôs tines and a spoon‚Äôs bowl provide useful points for balancing or interlocking.
2. Understand Center of Mass: The key to balancing is finding the point where the weight of the silverware is evenly distributed. For a single utensil, this is usually near the middle of its length. When combining multiple pieces, you‚Äôll adjust this based on how they connect.
3. Basic Finger Balancing (Single Utensil):
   * Hold a fork or spoon lightly between your thumb and index finger.
   * Slide your grip along its length until it balances horizontally without tipping. This is the simplest trick, akin to balancing a pencil, and might resemble Musk‚Äôs finger-balancing act seen in some clips.
4. Stacking or Interlocking (Multiple Pieces):
   * Fork and Spoon Method: Hook the tines of a fork into the handle of a spoon (or vice versa) so they form a stable connection. Adjust their angles until the combined structure balances on your finger or a surface. Friction between the pieces helps hold them together.
   * Counterbalance Technique: Position one utensil (e.g., a spoon) to extend in one direction and another (e.g., a fork) in the opposite direction. For example, rest the spoon‚Äôs bowl on a table edge and angle the fork‚Äôs tines downward to counterweight it, tweaking until it holds steady.

#Trump‚Äôs Aggression Sours Europe on US Cloud Giants

###Companies in the EU are starting to look for ways to ditch Amazon, Google, and Microsoft cloud services amid fears of rising security risks from the US. But cutting ties won‚Äôt be easy.

> The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti‚ÄìElon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.

> There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers.

post,1jizskm,,Can someone explain Elon Musk‚Äôs Claim on empathy?,"I'm not a fan of Elon, but I have a genuine question for those who might have some insight. Elon Musk recently said that ""the biggest weakness of the West was empathy."" I don‚Äôt want to strawman him‚ÄîI genuinely want to understand what he meant.

Surely, he can‚Äôt be referring to the fundamental human trait of empathy‚Äîthe very thing that, alongside intelligence, likely gave us the biggest evolutionary advantage over other species and helped us become the dominant force on this planet. Even conservative evolutionary biologists wouldn‚Äôt deny that. Empathy allowed us to build large, cooperative societies, which had a clear advantage over smaller, fragmented groups. If the majority of humans didn‚Äôt have empathy and we had all always resembled a person with ASPD, I‚Äôm sure we would still be living in caves. There's maybe a point that it could be advantageous if our leaders were psychopaths, I wouldn't like that but I can see the logic behind...

If you were to remove empathy completely, what would you replace it with to maintain a functioning civilization? The only alternative I can think of is something like the Borg in *Star Trek*‚Äîpure collectivism hive mind without emotional connection nor personal freedom.

So why the endless hate here? It‚Äôs the media‚Äîespecially the leftist outlets like CNN and NYT‚Äîpushing this fake ‚Äúsalute‚Äù narrative to torch his rep. They‚Äôre obsessed with painting him as some alt-right villain, cherry-picking X drama (yeah, hate speech‚Äôs up 50% since he took over, per Berkeley) while ignoring the bigger picture. Why? Musk‚Äôs running Trump‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency, cutting through the fraud and waste that‚Äôs been lining their cronies‚Äô pockets for years.

""Canada has frozen $43 million in payments to Tesla pending a line-by-line investigation into its last-minute surge in EV rebate claims made on the final weekend of the government program.

The American EV maker run by U.S. presidential adviser Elon Musk will also be excluded from all future EV rebate programs as long as tariffs are in place, former transport minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement.

The stop-payment order appears to have been made before the current election was called Sunday, though Freeland only confirmed it Tuesday, while on the campaign trail for her University‚ÄîRosedale seat.

‚ÄúAs soon as I became Transport Minister, I asked the department to stop all payments for Tesla vehicles in order to fully examine each claim individually and determine whether all are eligible and valid. No payments will be made until we are confident that the claims are valid,‚Äù she said in a statement texted to the Star.

‚ÄúI also directed my department to change the eligibility criteria for future iZEV programs to ensure that Tesla vehicles will not be eligible for incentive programs so long as the illegitimate and illegal U.S. tariffs are imposed against Canada.‚Äù""

post,1jq4hf3,,US Senate passed bill by slim margin in a 51-48 vote to block Trump's tariffs on imports from Canada,"4 Republicans cross the floor to vote with Democrats to pass a bill that would remove import tariffs on Canadian goods.

This still needs to pass the house (which has republican majority), and even if it passes the house, president can still veto. At which point it goes back to the senate and 2/3 need to vote to overturn the veto.

Low chance, but indication that dissent is happening within party lines given the economic downturn of tariff policy.

Interesting to see how many more house reps and senators break from party lines after today's ""liberation"" tariffs have time to impact markets and consumer prices

post,1jqyy5b,,US Equities lost 90%-and took 25 years to recover.,"Everyone is saying ""dip dip dip"" as if we are experiencing an overreaction to a small segment bubble. 

95 years ago the US levied the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, worldwide tariffs that were designed to encourage domestic production and punish ""cheating countries"". This kicked off a trade war that had no small part in causing a world-wide depression. 

The US has not levied global tariffs of this degree since then. Until yesterday.

What happened to US equities?  After a roaring bull run during which wealth was printed and the every-day man flung money in the market it crashed. But not overnight. In fits and starts the DJI lost 90% of its value over a 3 year period. 

It took *25* years for it to return to an ATH. 

Trump has fired 10s of thousands of federal employees. He's spiking unemployment. He's taxing imports to the tune of 50-100%. Other countries will do the same to us. Our companies will start having mass layoffs, crushing economic activity and investment. Domestic production will not return, everyone one will be out of money to buy stuff anyways. The SH tariffs did nothing to encourage domestic manufacturing, it just made everyone poorer. 

Maybe our monetary policy will prevent a Great Depression and we escape with ""only"" 8-10 percent unemployment, mild stagflation and the market takes 3-5 years to recover after a 50% fall.
 
I'd love to hear the thesis of *why* the market will recover or be higher in the next 12-24 months when we have a historical model staring us in the face.

There was no Tariff ‚Äúexception‚Äù announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff ‚Äúbucket.‚Äù The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER! The Golden Age of America, which includes the upcoming Tax and Regulation Cuts, a substantial amount of which was just approved by the House and Senate, will mean more and better paying Jobs, making products in our Nation, and treating other Countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us. The bottom line is that our Country will be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

This is why you don't believe any news over the weekend unless Trump or the White House covers on it. Tariffs are back on now!

post,1k1p0mo,,"Tesla speeds up odometers to avoid warranty repairs, US lawsuit claims","[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-speeds-odometers-avoid-warranty-213536596.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-speeds-odometers-avoid-warranty-213536596.html)

(Reuters) - Tesla faces a proposed class action claiming it speeds up odometers on its electric vehicles so they fall out of warranty faster, saving Elon Musk's company from having to pay for repairs.

The plaintiff Nyree Hinton alleged that Tesla odometer readings reflect energy consumption, driver behavior and ""predictive algorithms"" rather than actual mileage driven.

He said the odometer on the 2020 Model Y he bought in December 2022 with 36,772 miles on the clock ran at least 15% fast, based on his other vehicles and driving history, and for a while said he drove 72 miles a day when at most he drove 20.

Hinton, a Los Angeles resident, said this caused his 50,000-mile basic warranty to expire well ahead of schedule, leaving him with a $10,000 suspension repair bill that he thought Tesla should cover.

""By tying warranty limits and lease mileage caps to inflated 'odometer' readings, Tesla increases repair revenue, reduces warranty obligations, and compels consumers to purchase extended warranties prematurely,"" the complaint said.

Tesla and its lawyer did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment, but have denied all material allegations in the lawsuit. The Austin, Texas-based company does not have a media relations office.

Hinton is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for Tesla drivers in California, potentially encompassing more than 1 million vehicles, court papers show.

Tesla moved his lawsuit this month to Los Angeles federal court from a state court in that city.

The automaker has also faced litigation accusing it of inflating vehicle driving ranges.

In March 2024, a federal judge in Oakland, California said drivers in that case must pursue their claims in individual arbitrations, not a class action.

The case is Hinton v Tesla Inc et al, U.S.",2045,True,1744927363.0,2025-04-18 00:02:43,8734,329,callsonreddit,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k1p0mo/tesla_speeds_up_odometers_to_avoid_warranty/,True,0.98,2025,both,top,False,False,0,

post,1k5g9yj,,Tesla reports disappointing quarterly results as automotive revenue plunges 20%,"Tesla¬†reported a miss on the top and bottom lines in its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday as automotive revenue plunged 20% from a year earlier.

Here are the key numbers compared with LSEG expectations.

* **Earnings per share**: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated
* **Revenue**: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

It‚Äôs been a brutal start to the year for Tesla, with CEO¬†Elon Musk¬†spending much of his time in¬†President Donald Trump‚Äôs White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. The president‚Äôs sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment,¬†automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells.

Tesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday.

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will ‚Äúrevisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.‚Äù

post,1kbesxa,,I talked with a Chinese factory owner to see what‚Äôs happening on the ground. TL;DR: China has mobilized tons of resources to exporters but there‚Äôs some signs of pain,"I‚Äôm an American in China but have been seeing very little foreign reporting about what‚Äôs happening in China, which is weird to me because it seems pretty important to get a clear picture of the trade war. So here‚Äôs what I learned from him.

**Gov support**

-The local government is helping and giving him low interest rate loans / short term financial support. This type of thing is very common throughout China right now - lots of local govs are mobilizing to support exporters thru the tariff war. Li Qiang, central gov minister, says central government help is probably coming too 

-Guangzhou, and I assume others too, has also organized tons of seminars since Liberation Day with buyers from Europe, Latin America, and Asia. A big source of replacement demand for his factory has been from these

-He‚Äôs getting lots of buyers from TikTok shops overseas. It seems like TikTok is helping a lot to mitigate the demand impact 

-The news story of Walmart, Target, Costco, etc. resuming some orders is true, he confirmed it. But the amounts are **very, very** small

**Pain**

-He‚Äôs already re-evaluating employees and firing some soon. He said most exporters in Guangzhou are cutting some employees, but extremely US dependent exporters have furloughed most of their workforces until mid May

**Some good news for the U.S?**

-Before Liberation Day he was building a factory in the US and has now fully committed to it. But it‚Äôs having issues since the raw materials are sourced from China and they‚Äôre getting hit with tariffs

[The full interview is here](https://www.yaphete.com/p/live-from-the-trade-war-2-chinas), I didn‚Äôt write everything here.

post,1kq07vd,,"Who here is daily-driving 20+ year-old cars, and has it worked out?","My parents are in a bit of a financial hole and to help them out, I gave them my paid-off 2020 model year car with 40k miles.  They sold their most valuable car (they had two) to stay afloat. 

Some will argue I should‚Äôve let them consolidate down to one of their own while I kept mine, but part of the reason they are in bad financial shape is because they bought things to keep up with the joneses without budgeting for maintenance. And since they‚Äôre providing the roof over my head, I kinda have to give into their demands until I live on my own again. 

Since I‚Äôm mechanically-inclined and they aren‚Äôt, they gave me their old Mercedes ML320 to drive around while I job hunt. This car has lots of deferred maintenance but it is drivable. 

Now I‚Äôm thinking when I do start working again, maybe I should just go all-in and refurbish this car as much as I can to prevent tying up cash into a car payment again. It seems to be what a lot of my friends and old colleagues are doing. 



Edit: woah, this is an incredible amount of input. Glad to hear of everyone‚Äôs experiences.

post,1kqq4o9,,EV‚Äôs have been taking off in my city and I finally figured out why,"I live in a pretty rural area of western Pennsylvania and after paying a bit of attention to the specific cars around me, I got a good idea of how many EV‚Äôs were in my city. Outside of my own I had only ever really seen a couple Tesla‚Äôs but they weren‚Äôt popular. Less than 10, probably closer to 5 throughout the city. 

Over the past year there were a couple more that popped up including an EV9, and a Nissan Ariya. I‚Äôve seen a couple chevy‚Äôs, both Blazers and equinox, and even a mustang. But the last couple months they‚Äôve exploded. In My neighborhood there are 4 prologues out of nowhere. They‚Äôre easy to identify since I work from home and my desk is by the window near the stop sign. I always hear them as they come to a stop (the prologues are actually pretty loud with their hums) and they‚Äôre three different colors and the fourth has a bunch of decals. I‚Äôve also seen some new blazers around. 

I stopped in at a local shop and was talking to the owner like normal and she mentioned getting a Blazer. Last person I would‚Äôve thought, and 70+ year old lady on the verge of retirement. I asked what made her switch and she explained. She took her ICE in to get it serviced and the dealer made a new policy. Any loaner vehicle that wasn‚Äôt kept overnight required to be an EV. She said it was the safest and most comfortable she‚Äôs ever been in a car. She said she got her car back and that‚Äôs really when she felt how much she missed the car. She went back 2 weeks later to buy what she test drove. And the family that owns the dealership she goes to also owns the Honda dealership. 

That‚Äôs the biggest obstacle. Getting people to drive one, not necessarily buy them. Obviously the end goal is to buy and get more on the road, but instead of just talk talk talk, focus on just getting people to drive one. She wasn‚Äôt encouraged to buy it, just given it for a day. And that‚Äôs likely what happened with a lot of the prologues. GM and Honda are massive brands and have a lot of brand loyalty.",2261,True,1747696292.0,2025-05-20 01:11:32,1796,516,Buckles01,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kqq4o9/evs_have_been_taking_off_in_my_city_and_i_finally/,True,0.98,2025,tesla,top,False,False,0,

post,1kqw8br,,Hyundai N Festival N2 Cup Massive Crash and Drama,"It looks like not a lot of the English-speaking community has picked this up, so I wanted to do a quick write up.

So, for the headline crash: during the Hyundai N Festival N2 Cup Masters championship, a massive 4-car crash happened at an estimated 110km/h: https://youtu.be/7LcXpZj4IY8?t=16818 (timestamped; 4:40:22 if it doesn't work)

Note car 017 is the first to crash; you can see them spinning out shortly after cutting to the drone view. 

Unfortunately, while nobody was killed, there are rumors that one racer has suffered 3 fractured bones.

Now for some context behind the drama:

**The Hyundai N Festival**

This is an annual event sponsored by Hyundai (and a few other companies like Kumho tire) and operated by ""Playground"" (just a separate LLC sponsored by Hyundai) where they have sponsor booths, food trucks, showcasing cars, etc. The highlight of the festival are the spec race series.

There are three classes: eN1, N1, and N2. [eN1 is run with moderately modified Ioniq 5N chassis with a rollcage, suspension, brakes, widebody, and mild aero.](https://www.hyundai-n.com/en/experience/n-festival/about-korea?tab=en1#img-area). [N1 is similarly modified, but with Elantra N instead](https://www.hyundai-n.com/en/experience/n-festival/about-korea?tab=n1#img-area)


**N2 Cup Woes**


N2 is the problem child. N2 is a mostly stock Elantra N with a bucket seat, half-rollcage, steering wheel, brake pads, and a spec semislick tire. 

No suspension modification of any kind, nor brake modifications are allowed. The point is that Hyundai is marketing a mostly-stock Elantra N can be driven in a wheel to wheel race and still be okay--if you're active in the US track scene, in fact it mostly is... on a track day.

Since the series began, the N2 cup was shrouded in some hot water. Almost every year, there was an incident where tires were debeading off of the wheels.",6404,True,1747715207.0,2025-05-20 06:26:47,164,20,hatsune_aru,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1kqw8br/hyundai_n_festival_n2_cup_massive_crash_and_drama/,True,0.98,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1ktchqb,,The Lamborghini of Nauru's Police Chief?,"Seeking information regarding a Lamborghini reportedly located on the island nation of Nauru near Australia.

During a period of economic prosperity on Nauru, a story emerged about a police chief (or official) who acquired a Lamborghini. This individual was reportedly too large to comfortably operate the vehicle.

Request: Does anyone have factual information regarding this specific Lamborghini? This includes details such as the model year, any known history, or its current status. Photographic evidence would also be of interest.

I was able to find a BBC article mentioning it from 2008 mentioning it, but that was all I was able to find. Does anyone know which model it was, or what ended up happening to it? This would have been late 70's early 80's most likely. So possibly a Countach or Jalpa.

He also hopes that investors will look to ten years later.

As an investor, it is very important to look forward to a better future, because this is the basic concept of investment. However, this does not mean that we only look at the future and not the fundamentals of a company, that is, the main business. Not to mention what if this so-called future is unreliable? This interview can confirm that Saudi investors are very dissatisfied with the sales of his cars, which is Musk's most hated topic. After all, he has said that he doesn't like the car business anymore, and he wants to make cooler Robotaxi, robots, and FSD. And these are all far away.

I know that many Tesla fans have been insisting on proving to everyone how great FSD is. But you know, although many people have shown that FSD can travel 300KM, even across the east and west of the United States without human intervention once. But on the NHTSA registration list, it is L2 autonomous driving. I even wonder why NHTSA allows FSD to be approved without holding the steering wheel. After all, it is only L2 instead of L3 or L4. Of course, this is not important. What is important is that the foundation of FSD today is not enough to support Robotaxi.

I have also met Tesla fans who told me, ""If FSD really doesn't work, at most we can add a lidar, which is not a difficult task."" When I used the logic of business school to analyze it for them, when lidar is added, the competitors will become WAYMO, and WAYMO has been leading for 5 years in using lidar and getting L4, so Tesla will have to catch up.

Tesla fans said contemptuously, ""So what, does WAYMO have a rocket? Can it take us to Mars?""

In the past, Musk could always say Next Year, but when Next Year has arrived, what should he do? Forever Mars plan?

post,1ktff15,,"Electric trains, buses and cycles are more efficient and practical ways of electrification than electric cars!","Electric trains and buses have existed for century. Massive transit systems like Newyork Subway, London underground, Paris metro, Moscow metro, trams and trolleys have been successfully fully running electricity for nearly a century. 

India has electrified 99% of their railway network. It's 75% for china. 70% for France and Spain. 55% for Russia and Germany.

Then we come to electric bikes. They are selling a lot more than electric cars even in USA where there isn't any proper cycling infrastructure.

https://www.bicycling.com/news/a39838840/ebikes-are-outpacing-electric-car-sales-in-the-us/

Trolley buses have existed for decades in many cities. From Moscow to Mexico city.

Electrification of buses with batteries are also a lot more successful than cars.

https://www.sustainable-bus.com/news/bloomberg-new-energy-finance-long-term-forecast-on-electric-buses-vehicles/


 You can have buses with much smaller batteries and use opportunity charging as buses would wait sometimes in terminal any way. Also it's much easier to implement battery swapping for buses than cars. Also in motion charging with trolley bus wires too is possible.

Then we come to resource consumption for cars vs public transportation. Let's take battery needed for electrification. Shenzen has a 100% electric bus fleet. An electric bus would mostly have 500 kWh battery pack. This can be reduced below 100 kWh by opportunity charging (like pantograph charging or battery swapping). Let's be conservative and assume you need 500 kWh battery per bus. And there is one bus per 500 residents in Shenzen. So it comes down to only 625 Wh/person. If they owned cars they would need atleast 15,000 Wh/person assuming one car with 60 kWh battery per a family of 4. This can go upto 60,000 Wh/person or even higher if there's one car per person.

You can also use trolley buses for very busy bus routes. Which would only need a very small battery.

As someone who has lost a significant amount of money shorting Tesla, I'd like to share my thoughts.

**Stage 1: Inception**

> TL;DR: Elon and Tesla capitalized on three key movements: the green movement, cultural status, and visionary leadership of the third industrial revolution.

To understand Tesla today, we need to look back 20 years. Tesla should never have succeeded. There has not been a new car company to sell over 9,000 cars (the DeLorean) in over 100 years before Tesla. Tesla's founders aimed to transform the world by developing an electric vehicle to propel the world toward a green future. Looking for new investments with his PayPal winnings, Elon joined the Tesla team. The founders had a vision and direction, but over time, Elon pushed for continually expanding changes and leveraged his funding and chairman status to execute a Coup d'√©tat to become CEO.

To Elon's credit, it worked. The Roadster was a wild success. Elon leveraged this momentum to convince governments to create billions in long-term subsidies, which enabled them to establish a legitimate foundation as both an industrial power and a strong brand among those invested in the green revolution. He also leveraged this momentum to establish a powerful following of loyal customers who shared his mission and to attract top talent seeking a brighter future.

This also created a flywheel of success: Elon leverages his status to market a new revolutionary dream -> people believe him because of his previous success and the desire for it to be true -> personal or government funding is generated that drives this dream -> Elon forces through objections and doubt -> the dream is partially implemented -> Elon's status as a visionary leader is enhanced.",10221,True,1748006096.0,2025-05-23 15:14:56,30,25,Epicism,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ktjam4/tesla_vision_volatility_and_the_illusion_of/,True,0.73,2025,both,hot,False,False,0,

Oracle will spend around $40bn on Nvidia‚Äôs high-performance computer chips to power OpenAI‚Äôs new giant US data centre, as tech groups race to build the vast infrastructure needed to underpin artificial intelligence models.

The site in Abilene, Texas, has been billed as the first US Stargate project, the $500bn data centre scheme spearheaded by OpenAI and SoftBank, and will provide 1.2 gigawatts of power when it is completed next year, making it one of the largest in the world.

Oracle will purchase around 400,000 of Nvidia‚Äôs GB200 chips ‚Äî its latest ‚Äúsuperchip‚Äù for training and running AI systems ‚Äî and lease the computing power to OpenAI, according to several people familiar with the matter.

The site‚Äôs owners, Crusoe and US investment firm Blue Owl Capital, have raised $15bn in debt and equity to finance the Abilene project, which will encompass eight buildings and first broke ground in June last year.

The data centre is expected to be fully operational by mid-2026. Oracle has agreed to lease the site for 15 years. Stargate, which incorporated earlier this year, has not invested in the site.

JPMorgan has provided the bulk of the debt financing across two loans totalling $9.6bn, according to people close to the matter, including a $7.1bn loan announced this week. Crusoe and Blue Owl have separately invested around $5bn in cash.

Once completed, its scale will rival plans by Elon Musk to expand his ‚ÄúColossus‚Äù data centre in Memphis, Tennessee, to house around 1mn Nvidia chips.

BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) -Nvidia will launch a new artificial intelligence chipset for China at a significantly lower price than its recently restricted H20 model and plans to start mass production as early as June, sources familiar with the matter said.

The GPU or graphics processing unit will be part of Nvidia's latest generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors and is expected to be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, well below the $10,000-$12,000 the H20 sold for, according to two of the sources.

The lower price reflects its weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements.

It will be based on Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a server-class graphics processor and will use conventional GDDR7 memory instead of more advanced high bandwidth memory, the two sources said.

post,1kufw75,,But Wait‚ÄîNavitas (NVTS) Has Already Doubled! Should I Wait for a Dip?,"
1.Massive Market Opportunity:The Ga N semiconductor market is expected to grow at over 20% CAGR, potentially reaching multi-billion-dollar scale by 2028. Navitas is well-positioned to capture a significant slice of this pie.

2. Undervalued vs peers.Compared to larger semiconductor players, Navitas trades at a fraction of the valuation despite superior growth potential in AI power ICs. This creates a classic asymmetric risk-reward setup.

Bottom line:If Navitas executes flawlessly and rides the AI infrastructure wave, a 10 x return isn‚Äôt just possible‚Äîit‚Äôs probable. So longterm theres no point trying to catch the dip

post,1kum63j,,How bad can it get when crypto goes POOF?,"Right now there is about 3 trillion market cap in crypto, which is making a lot of people feel significantly richer than they are. supposing crypto market cap goes to near zero, I do not think there has ever been a wealth destruction event like that ever in the history of markets. I think it could have significant impacts on the global economy, causing a very real financial crisis.

AI is probably in a bubble as well, there are very obvious stocks at the very least which are beyond reason, such as tesla and Palantir.

These seem to be a staple in the modern portfolio, and could contribute to an even greater loss of the wealth effect.

the wealth effect would further deteriorate as multiple compression occurs across the board in a bear market.

A lot of people will probably pile on here saying that crypto wont go to zero, but factually there is only one use for blockchain technology right now and that would be a CBDC. CBDC would not have anything to do with the current coins which are being treated as ponzi schemes, and would not be related to the likes of tether or USDC. As matter of fact tether and USDC would likely stop existing as liquidity for them would dry up in an event where there is no coins to gamble on outside of them.

Is the next great financial crisis going to play out something like this? and when will it occur? Historically in great bubbles they were nearing an end when political figures were stoking the fire for personal gain. It is not hard to see this playing out right now. A lot of people find comfort that there is greater acceptance of crypto, but in fact it is a sign that the party is nearing its end. History rhymes.

EDIT: I have responded a lot in here, I think that I have clarified a few things with people and would like to change my wording above.

**Key Takeaways**

* Nvidia's scheduled earnings Wednesday highlight the tech financial reports calendar this week, along with quarterly updates from Salesforce, Marvell Technologies, Dell, and HP. Other noteworthy reports expected include retailers Costco, AutoZone, and Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods.
* Friday‚Äôs PCE inflation report will provide insight into price pressure in April, while investors will also be following updates to first-quarter GDP, the U.S. trade balance, and consumer confidence.
* Federal Reserve officials set to speak this week include Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller and New York Fed President John Williams, coming as the Fed is scheduled to release the minutes from its May meeting.

Nvidia (NVDA) earnings and a key inflation report highlight this week‚Äôs¬†holiday-shortened calendar¬†as investors continue to evaluate the impact of¬†President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs¬†and¬†economic policies.

Tech companies Salesforce (CRM), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Dell Technologies (DELL), and HP (HPQ) are expected to deliver earnings this week. Market watchers will also be looking for reports from retailers Costco Wholesale (COST), AutoZone (AZO), Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods (DKS), and Temu parent PDD Holdings (PDD).

The reports are set to arrive after a down week for stocks, which was punctuated Friday by a revival of trade-related uncertainty. You can recap¬†last week's trading here.

In addition to Friday's¬†personal consumption expenditures¬†inflation report on Friday, investors will also be tuned into first-quarter¬†gross domestic product (GDP)¬†updates and the latest data on the U.S. trade balance and retail inventories. Consumer confidence and sentiment surveys also will be in focus.

I noticed there is a new feature: Start FSD from Park.  I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs new.  I was at our local Tractor Supply when I decided to try it out.  Clicked on the button, pressed on the brake and we got started.  My MY navigated through the parking lot and instead of turning left as it always does, it turned right (south) onto Rt 10.  Not one to argue I let her do her thing.  I found myself driving scenic local roads instead of jumping right onto Rt 30 bypass which is the usual our MY goes.  It was winding and a lot of fun.  Couple of Amish buggies as usual, no problem going around them. Here‚Äôs the major surprise.  Unlike a few days ago, the MY not only correctly identified our driveway, it smoothly without stopping turned into our 300+ foot long winding driveway and brought the vehicle to our front parking area right next to the front door!  Usually there is a few places where there‚Äôs confusion when approaching our home, often it tried to pull in to our neighbor‚Äôs driveway if left to its own devices.  Previously, even when I tried to get her to go up our driveway under FSD it would often mistake a gravel parking area and turn into it half of the time.

I'm biased, but I see new C3 footage, I post. TFLclassics has a very base spec early C3, which is an interesting car to look at. It only has a 327ci V8 rated at 300hp gross, mated to a 3-speed manual, which probably gives it acceleration figures comparable to the later gas crisis cars. That being said, definitely still a fun car to cruise around in, and the input points are very positive in these old C3s. Throttle response, shift-feel, steering, braking, etc. actually feel really good in good condition cars. It reminds me of my reaction the first time I used the brakes on my '80. It felt so positive, like it was happy to stop you at any speed... up until the low traction of the crappy BFG radial T/As locked up.

Then there‚Äôs BYD. Not as flashy, but they‚Äôre dominating China 34% of the NEV market in 2024, $107B in revenue (more than Tesla!), and some insane charging tech (250 miles in 5 minutes?!). Plus, their cars are affordable. Under $10K for an EV? That‚Äôs game-changing

Sure, BYD isn‚Äôt as far along with FSD, but they‚Äôre investing $14B into making smarter cars. And the stock‚Äôs trading at a sane valuation (under 27x earnings). Tesla? Still moon-high

It seems like some podcasts or episodes are only playing through my left speakers on my model 3 2023.

I think it may be down to encoding from the podcast producers or something like that, but would love your take.

Given I've now driven >30,000 miles, it felt like a good time to share the data and because I had it, I also shared comparisons to the Bolt EUV.¬†

|Measure|2023 Tesla Model 3 RWD|2022 Bolt EUV FWD|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Miles**|30,499|19,912|
|**Total kWh**|9,028|6,547|
|**Wh/Mi; Mi/kWh; MPGe**|296; 3.38; 114|329; 3.04; 103|
|**Average Temp**|49F|52F|
|**Savings ; Tax**\*\*\*|$2,076.44; $437.37|$1,454.89; $279.50|

**SAVINGS**  
*\*I benchmarked the fuel costs associated against my prior car, a Toyota Corolla which got 33.17 mpg over the 100,000+ miles I tracked it, and I also benchmarked against current gas prices, which in my area have been roughly $3/gallon but I am using nuanced* [*monthly averages for my state*](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM_EPMRU_PTE_NUS_DPG&f=W)*. I also bake in a $30 oil change per 5,000 miles as ""fuel"".*¬†

*\*\*I also calculated the portion of my savings that is due to taxes I'm not paying at the pump (0.285+0.184 per gallon) - which is relevant politically given we can expect a $250/year EV surcharge to attempt to ""close that loophole"", which for me, looks to be ""fair"" if it were state + federal, but just being federal and* combine*d with my state's surcharge ($75), it is not.*¬†

I have insurance, tabs, depreciation, maintenance, as well but wanted to focus on ""fuel"". Those costs are all higher than the Corolla due to the Tesla (and Bolt) being much newer cars (and fully insured instead of minimally insured) and the heightened costs do offset the fuel-savings for now. I'll be curious to see over 100,000+ miles how the total cost to own tightens up and I expect the Tesla to win out.

post,1kwjdmm,,TSLA: Why I'm still bullish despite the EPS nosedive,"Been holding TSLA since 2021 and just watched their recent earnings with mixed feelings. While everyone's freaking out about the 53% EPS drop, I've been trying to make sense of why the stock is still up 37% over the same period. Either I'm missing something or the market is.

My position: 120 shares @ $187 average (up about 81% total)

The Q1 earnings were objectively bad

EPS of $0.27 vs expected $0.41 (missed by 34%)

Factory changeovers for Model Y killed production numbers

Automotive margins down to 19% from previous highs in the mid-20s

Musk sounding increasingly distracted on the call

Yet I'm still holding and even added 15 shares on the post-earnings dip. Here's why:

The energy business is quietly becoming a monster

While everyone obsesses over car deliveries, Tesla's energy storage business hit record gross profit with 26% margins. My brother works in commercial solar, and he says Megapack orders are backlogged for months. The margins here are substantially better than automotive, and it's growing faster.

The robotaxi bet could pay off big

I was skeptical about the robotaxi timeline until I saw the Austin test videos. If they actually launch paid rides next month as planned, it changes everything about the valuation model. Even if it's limited geographically, proving the technology works would be massive.

Optimus robot could be the sleeper hit

The Optimus humanoid robot is another wild card that could transform Tesla's business model.

post,1kwrt8l,,New 3-row EV comparison,"Below is the summary by Google NotebookLM

* **Kia EV9**
   * **Price:** Starts at $54,900, or basically $55,000, making it the cheapest and best value vehicle in the three-row segment. The as-tested price of the specific model shown was just over $70,000, around $72,000. You can get the Land trim with a large battery pack and dual motor for this price. Leasing is also mentioned as very cheap, around $299 per month with about $2500 down (taxes included in Colorado).
   * **Range:** The video mentions the EPA rated range is put up. The large battery pack is almost 100 kilowatt hours. The range is described as ""not all that much,"" just under 100 kilowatt hours, but considered an ""easy justification"" for the price.
   * **Charging Performance:** Charging performance is noted as being good due to its EGMP platform. The peak charging speed is about 220 kW briefly, but most of the time it's about 200 kW, and it holds this speed deep into the pack, sitting at just about 200 kW up to 80%. This makes it an amazing charging vehicle for road trips. However, it's the only vehicle in the comparison that doesn't natively interface well with the Tesla Supercharger network, getting a maximum of 84 kW currently, though this is expected to increase to 125 kW for model year 2026. It uses an onboard booster for Supercharging and can be buggy.
* **Cadillac Vistic**
   * **Price:** Described as ""quite a bit more money than the Kia,"" starting around $80,000 base, with the as-tested model around $84,000. Higher trims can go up to $100,000.
   * **Range:** Shares the Lyric battery, which GM quotes as 102 kilowatt hours capacity, though it's closer to 105-106 kWh. The battery capacity is only about 10 to 20 kWh more than the smaller Equinox and Optic, which feels like a lot of money for the battery size in a large car.

No Apple, Amazon, or Tesla which are too consumer facing. Have the AI tech behemoths, which are also the true quantum plays. Have insurance companies, contrarian bets, mix of mid cap growth companies which have proven themselves with continuously strong earnings reports, and few crazy growth stories.

**The Rules**: DCA daily, when fear and greed index dumps below 25 then aggressively DCA even lump sum. If a company has more than 2 bad earnings more-so guidance than they're out.

**Good Time To Buy?**: I believe they're all overpriced right now. Will hedge with UVXY calls buying monthlies, selling against the position creating diagonals at various strikes when there's an upcoming binary event which could be negative catalyst.

**Changes This Time**: Am combining timing the market increasing DCA'ing amounts, actively managing based off of ER's/guidance, and hedging against during drawdowns using longer dated uvxy calls.

Hi everyone,

I noticed yesterday that my passenger headrest in my 2021 Model Y. From my research, this appears to be a common issue.

I sent in a service request and received an invoice for $205. Looking on third-party sites, I can find OEM headrests for ~$50 and can easily replace it myself. However, this OEM number is 1623801-00-A. The OEM part for the headrest that Tesla quoted me was 1623798-91-C.

Again doing research, I cannot find much difference between these OEM parts. Both appear to fit my 2021 MY. It appears the Tesla quoted OEM would include abilities for ‚Äúspecial features‚Äù? I am not sure what special features would be included in my headrest. 

Would anyone be able to guide me in the right direction here?",729,False,1748375823.0,2025-05-27 21:57:03,1,7,ImmediateMajor4337,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwx3a7,False,0.6,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kx07eb,,FSD AI halucinating / lying just like regular AI?," I have an exit I prefer to use that is one prior to the direct exit due to that street having lots of pot holes and construction. I have tried and can not permanently edit the route.  When I am on the freeway maybe 10 miles out I will edit the route and select the other route with the exit prior.  Often when I hit accept the map refreshes and then reverts to the original exit so that I have to click the change again.

Since the last update it will accept the change right away and reflect it on the map and also in the turn by turn direction.  The car will start moving to the exit lane and then pass the exit and take the one it wanted in the first place. This morning it passed the exit again and then turned on the signal and wanted to take the emergency lane on the overpass thinking it could still get off.

It will also do this when I get home.  I re-route, it accepts and confirms and I can see the change on the map then it will wait too long to merge and take the next street anyways (the street it initally said it would take)

  
I get the feeling they system will do what I want after asking a few times just to shut me up (such as putting on the signal multiple times before it decides to change lanes) and then just does what it originally wanted anyways.

Now I do notice that I have the cameras active 90% of the drive and once I get to this part of the freeway I have been loosing my cabin camera monitoring and get the streeting wheel nag.

post,1kx0z93,,Exploring FSD is fun!,"Carrying in on my exploration of the latest FSD release, we got a call from Applebee‚Äôs.  My wife left her phone at the restaurant.  I immediately volunteered to retrieve the pink princess phone. My motives weren‚Äôt pure of course, I just wanted an excuse to try out FSD again.  I‚Äôm sure my OCD ‚Äòdrove‚Äô me to this.  From the garage I launched FSD with the parking option.  Maggie (my model Y‚Äôs name ‚Äòcause her license plate starts with MGY) obediently backed up, did a 3 corner turn and moved onto the road.  She navigated the entire 4 miles on local roads without fuss including a bridge out (common here in Pennsylvania) and not only got me into Applebees parking lot but pulled straight in to a parking spot.  That flustered me because I thought for sure she‚Äôd back in.  Oh well.  I retrieved the errant iPhone and started the voyage back home with FSD from the parking spot.  As I approached a critical intersection that normally goes straight she indicated a turn.  I thought ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not right‚Äù and overrode and went straight.  Shortly after that I got stuck in a 1/2 mile backup on a two lane road.  After 10 minutes of listening to Audible I decided to turn around and try another path home.  As soon as I made the U-turn I turned over driving to Maggie.  Soon I was back on track (I waved to others stuck in the jam whilst driving to make their own getaway) and Maggie did her magic.  I was back on track enjoying the Audible book (Bobiverse book 3).  From that point on she got me home through a couple more nasties and, yay, she turned into our driveway right up to the house.  Not quite pulling into the garage but close enough.  Damn, I‚Äôm REALLY loving this!  Let me know if I‚Äôm being way over the top with this experience or if you want me to post more like this.

Has anyone else who has upgraded to a 2026 Model Y while keeping their older Model Y experienced this?

Over the past several months, I've had an intermittent issue where I'll be using FSD and the car will start alarming and saying to take over immediately followed by ""Autopilot aborted due to system error"". It then takes 5 or so minutes for it to come back online. At first, I brushed it off as a bug in the software, but it became more frequent and recently went as far as braking to a stop and putting itself in park in the middle of a highway.

  
What's odd is that after it does its reboot, there are no lingering user facing errors or notifications to get the vehicle serviced. In service mode the main alert showing up is APS\_w159\_apbCritical which states ""*Autopilot Processor Secondary (APS) detects that the Autopilot Processor Backup (APB) is not functioning as expected, making Autopilot (AP) features unavailable.""* 

  
I've already made a service appointment, but the Tesla service technician seemed to be dismissive of there being a real problem and scheduled me pretty far out. My concern is that this seems to keep happening on multiple software versions and does not seem to be a common error other drivers are reporting. The most info I can find seems to revolve around the 2024 holiday update bricking model 3s built in the same month mine was, but I had no issue with the update and my car does not completely loose FSD/AP after rebooting like other cars did.

  
If anyone can give any anecdotal experience with a similar issue and/or advice on handling the service appointment, I'd greatly appreciate it!",1723,False,1748395389.0,2025-05-28 03:23:09,1,3,Isotopicgoose,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kx4kb9/model_3_hw4_fsd_software_crashes_and_ap_critical/,True,0.6,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kxf90a,,Suggestion: enable/disable accessory power via App/API,"I love that we can now enable/disable accessory power through the vehicle. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like this is possible via the [vehicle commands API](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/vehicle-commands#charge-max-range) or through the Tesla App itself. My use case: I have a battery-powered (independent of the vehicle HV/LV batteries) Dashcam that charges via the onboard 12V when I'm driving the car. 



Unfortunately, during long absences between driving / very short drives, I'm not able to charge the battery enough to get a reliable 12 - 14 hours of standby recording. I could leave the setting on permanently but this is wasteful and results in significantly higher idle-power usage. 



Ideally, I'd like a setting where I could have 12V power for 1-2 hours (enough to charge the battery, and then shutoff). Rivian has a feature like this and I've found it super helpful. It would also be cool to enable this as an API command and then use Tessie to trigger automations.



Why do I use an external dashcam? The optical quality of Blackvue dashcams is superior to Tesla's cameras and this has allowed me to capture license plate details where Tesla's built-in cameras have failed. I also like the fact that the front lens features a 136 degree wide horizontal capture angle, which allows me to get more of the road. I use a battery so that the dashcam can record even when the vehicle is off.",1428,False,1748433637.0,2025-05-28 14:00:37,5,4,JamMydar,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kxf90a/suggestion_enabledisable_accessory_power_via/,True,1.0,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kxrc5b,,"Leno's Law [35 year smog exemption in CA] has passed a major hurdle, but lost some of its teeth.","Around a month ago the 35 year smog exemption was placed in suspense while the appropriations committee spent more time on it. On Friday it successfully made it out of the appropriations committee, and should (hopefully) get a full vote by the CA senate.

But in the appropriations committee they made some modifications that make it somewhat less useful. The important part of the current amended text now reads:

***(c)¬† For purposes of subdivision (a), a collector motor vehicle, as defined in Section 259 of the Vehicle Code, is exempt from those portions of the test required by subdivision (f) of Section 44012 if the collector motor vehicle meets all of the following criteria:***

* ***(1)¬†Submission of proof that the motor vehicle is insured as a collector motor vehicle, as shall be required by regulation of the bureau.***
* ***(2)¬†The motor vehicle is at least 35 model years old.***
* ***(3)¬†The motor vehicle complies with the exhaust emissions standards for that motor vehicle‚Äôs class and model year as prescribed by the department, and the motor vehicle passes a functional inspection of the fuel cap and a visual inspection for liquid fuel leaks.***

Both (1) and (3) represent a significant modification from the previous text. It looks like you'll have to submit some paperwork to do.

(3) Makes it unclear to me what actual benefit this bill will have if it gets passed. This gives the department (DMV) significant leeway to prescribe emissions standards that could really moot the whole point of the bill. We may not have a good idea what those will be until this is actually implemented, but I'm not overwhelmingly hopeful given the history of this kind of thing.

(Reuters) -Tesla is poised to begin its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin on June 12, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The date has been discussed internally and could still change, the report added.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Earlier this month, CEO Elon Musk said the EV maker is set to begin a test of its long-promised robotaxi service on schedule in Austin, Texas, by the end of June.

A successful robotaxi trial is crucial for Tesla as Musk has shifted the company's focus away from building a new, cheaper EV platform to launching the robotaxi service and its Optimus humanoid robots. Much of Tesla's valuation hangs on that bet.

Tesla sales have fallen worldwide with rising competition and as Musk faces a backlash for his political views and his role as an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump.

post,1kxu7oq,,First-Time EV Buyer's Guide,"I often help people on the weekly General Questions and Purchasing Advice thread, and have been thinking about doing something like this to compile my answers to common questions. I'm going to structure it like a guide for each part of the buying process, but it's more like a collection of my thoughts. I'd be happy to add to it if anyone has anything else to contribute! This is also US-centric (sorry). 

#The Starting Line
So you want to buy an EV eh? Awesome! The process is, in general, very similar to buying a standard internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, but with a few key additional areas of research. I'm going to assume you generally know the basics of ICE vehicle ownership, and make this guide as specific as possible the electric portion of the vehicle purchasing. 

Let me say this up top though if you are on the fence for an EV. If you can charge at home and have a two-car (or more) household, you 100% should make one of those cars an EV. You'll save money on gas and oil changes, and experience the convenience of leaving home with a full ""tank"" every morning. You can get a used Chevy Bolt or Tesla for less than $10k almost anywhere in the US if you qualify for the $4k tax credit, and they're great vehicles that can completely cover 99% of driving needs (and obviously there's plenty of vehicles at higher prices). If that's all you need to hear, go for it. 

# Assess your situation
As always you should buy a car that suits your needs. Trucks for construction work, vans for families, etc. EVs are no different, but you should ask yourself a few additional questions to determine which, if any, EV is right for you: 

* The first, most important question - do you have a place to charge? The main benefit EV owners cite is that the vehicle can ""refuel"" at home, every night. In contrast, the ""worst"" part of the experience is public charging.",15761,True,1748470421.0,2025-05-29 00:13:41,85,53,chilidoggo,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kxu7oq/firsttime_ev_buyers_guide/,True,0.96,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kxwjdj,,Tesla investors demand Musk work 40-hour week at EV maker as ‚Äòcrisis‚Äô builds,"Elon Musk¬†needs to spend more time at¬†Tesla¬†as his electric vehicle company faces a ‚Äúcrisis,‚Äù according to a letter on Wednesday from a group of pension fund leaders who manage investments in the company.

‚ÄúTesla‚Äôs stock price volatility, declining sales, as well as disconcerting reports regarding the company‚Äôs human rights practices, and a plummeting global reputation are cause for serious concern,‚Äù the investors wrote in a letter to Robyn Denholm, the company‚Äôs board chair. ‚ÄúMoreover, many issues are linked to Mr. Musk‚Äôs actions outside of his role as Technoking and Chief Executive Officer at Tesla, including his high-profile role as an architect of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).‚Äù

The investors want the Tesla board to require Musk to work a minimum of 40 hours per week at the automaker as a condition of any new compensation plan they may arrange for him. They also want a clear succession plan for management of the EV business, and a policy that would apply to all Tesla directors limiting their outside board commitments at public and private companies.

Early last year, the Delaware Court of Chancery ordered¬†Tesla¬†to rescind Musk‚Äôs 2018 CEO pay package, which had been worth around $56 billion, finding that Musk controlled the company, and the board‚Äôs compensation committee misled shareholders before seeking their vote to approve the plan.

Musk now says he wants even more shares, amounting to 25%¬†voting control¬†of the company.

Tesla‚Äôs¬†brand¬†value and reputation have declined since 2024, due largely to¬†Musk‚Äôs incendiary rhetoric and political activities. In addition to pouring nearly $300 million into an effort to get¬†Donald Trump¬†back into the White House, Musk formally endorsed Germany‚Äôs far-right AfD party ahead of the country‚Äôs parliamentary election this year.

At DOGE, Musk has led an initiative by the Trump administration to slash federal agencies.",3951,True,1748476658.0,2025-05-29 01:57:38,316,51,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kxwjdj/tesla_investors_demand_musk_work_40hour_week_at/,True,0.94,2025,both,hot,False,False,0,

post,1ky8r5u,,NY Times: Export Controls Are Endangering the Fragile U.S.-China Truce,"Just two-and-a-half weeks after agreeing to suspend tariffs, both countries are using export controls to disrupt each other‚Äôs key industries.

After stepping back this month from an escalating and dangerous war of tariffs, the United States and China are now threatening to undermine their uneasy truce.

On May 12, the countries announced after weekend meetings in Geneva that they would suspend most of their recently imposed tariffs. Since then, however, both governments have shown that they are still prepared to wield controls over critical exports as weapons against one another, with moves that are potentially even more damaging to trade and global supply chains.

China has restricted its exports of rare earth magnets, which are crucial for cars, semiconductors, aircraft and many other applications. Close to 90 percent of the world‚Äôs rare earth metals, including magnets, are produced in China.

And the United States on May 13 banned the latest semiconductors from Huawei, a Chinese electronics giant. Then on Wednesday, President Trump suspended the shipment of American semiconductors and some aerospace equipment needed for China‚Äôs commercial aircraft, the C919, a signature project in China‚Äôs push toward economic self-reliance.

The increasing use of export controls by both countries amounts to supply chain warfare, interrupting the flow of key components that the other country must have to operate huge industries that employ large numbers of workers.

Last week, Ford Motor temporarily closed a factory in Chicago that makes Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles after one of its suppliers ran out of the magnets. In most new cars, the magnets are used in dozens of electric motors that operate brake and steering systems, fuel injectors and even power seats.

post,1kyk96u,,Wall connector: NACS or Universal,"Hey there,
I have a 26 Juniper and 21 Bolt. Obviously, different connectors for charging with NACS and J1772. 

I moved recently and to have a new plug installed outside with my Grizzl-E‚Äôs NEMA 14-50 is not recommended without a GCFI breaker. I have decided to sell the Grizzl-E and purchase a Tesla wall connector. 

I regularly charge my Bolt at Superchargers with a A2Z EV CCS1 to NACS connector and also own a A2Z EV NACS to J1772 connector. 

Which way do you think I should go?

1. Tesla Wall Connector with NACS only and then use the A2Z adapter with the Bolt. 
2. Tesla Universal Wall Connector with NACS and J1772.

post,1kyl4rv,,Question about Tesla Cars,"Hello,

I‚Äôd like to start this off by saying that I have this problem where people keep hitting my car. Doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm stopped at a red light or just driving in my own lane. Somehow, people keep hitting me. I haven‚Äôt been at fault for any of these incidents so far. I‚Äôm pretty fed up with this because I‚Äôve had my car for less than one year and it has been hit three times. I don‚Äôt even live in a big city. 

So, my question is: will a Tesla alert me if another car makes contact with mine, even if it‚Äôs just a really small bump? 

In one of the incidents I had, I was on a busy highway, stopped at a red light. I noticed the person behind me was super close to me but my car didn‚Äôt move and I didn‚Äôt hear a sound (my window was down) so I drove off. Later I checked and there was a dent in my car where the person hit me.

post,1kyld3i,,New vehicle purchase - check my gas/kWh math please,"TLDR: upgrading from a 35mpg (city) 2nd gen Prius to PHEV or EV, think either one will save us in the long run as gasoline costs increase here in California, but based on my math it is not looking feasible. I need some input if my math needs to account for other factors. 

For context, my wife has a 2007 Prius that's reliable but showing its age. Haven't done much highway driving lately but have been tracking the last few fuel purchases of mostly city driving and it seems to be getting about 35mpg lately. Regular 87 octane is holding at around $4/gallon. So approx 11.4 cents per mile for fuel only (not including maintenance, etc).
Central Valley CA. We are expected to see gas in the $6-8 range within the next 2 years due to refineries shutting down permanently, unless there is some course correction with the political winds.

Our goal in a new vehicle is to upgrade from what we currently have and have a vehicle that is good for long trips. We think PHEV is the ideal candidate. It would allow efficient daily commute use, but still have the engine and tank to take us anywhere on longer trips like we currently use her car or my truck (400-500 mile range) without having to deal with the range anxiety or charging times of a full EV. 

I'm learning to look past the MPGe number and look more closely at the specs, since MPGe is an average formula based on average driver use case scenario. 
Learning to ask: what is the MPG of the gas powertrain that will take us on longer trips, and what is the kWh/100 mile number.

Example a new Kia Sorento or Sportage PHEV have 31/34 miles of EV range respectively, and approx 34-36mpg gas, but a Mazda CX90 has 26 miles of battery range and only gets 26mpg gas. These are just a few PHEV models we have considered. 
Digging deeper, the kWh/100 mile ratings:
Kia Sportage PHEV 40
Kia Sorento PHEV 45
Mazda CX-90 PHEV 58

We do not currently have solar, it is in the future plans, so for now just paying straight PG&E rates on a tiered rate plan.",3710,True,1748550691.0,2025-05-29 22:31:31,4,58,keepcalmandcarryone,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kyld3i/new_vehicle_purchase_check_my_gaskwh_math_please/,True,0.64,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

If you're stuck with the ‚ÄúDownload the Tesla One App‚Äù message at [192.168.92.1](http://192.168.92.1), stop wasting time. Download the *Tesla One* app, select ‚ÄúExternal Partner,‚Äù enter your Wall Connector serial manually, and use Setup Mode (blinking green) to reconfigure your unit.

\--

Alright Reddit ‚Äî if you‚Äôre trying to reconfigure your Gen 3 Tesla Wall Connector (like resetting it or changing the breaker size), and all you‚Äôre getting is the ‚ÄúTesla One App ‚Äì Partner Access Only‚Äù screen at [`http://192.168.92.1`](http://192.168.92.1), here‚Äôs what actually worked for me after way too much trial and error. Tesla has changed how commissioning works, and most of the info online is now outdated.

# What You‚Äôll Need:

* Tesla One App (not the regular Tesla app)
* Wall Connector serial number (usually on the back of the unit, behind the cover)
* A Tesla account (yes, even if you don‚Äôt own a Tesla)
* Your Wi-Fi password
* A little patience

# Steps to Reset or Recommission:

1. Download the **Tesla One App**
2. Choose **External Partner** when prompted
3. Log in or create a Tesla account
4. Tap: *Installs ‚Üí Continue ‚Üí Go to Home*
5. Tap **Begin Install**
6. Choose **Enter Connector Info Manually**
7. Type in your unit‚Äôs serial number
8. Put your Wall Connector into setup mode by holding the charging handle button for \~6 seconds until the LED blinks green
9. Tap **Join** when prompted
10. Follow the rest of the prompts:

* Set country
* Adjust breaker size (e.g., 50A sets output to 40A)
* Connect to Wi-Fi
