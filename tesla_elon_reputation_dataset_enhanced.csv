comment,6erjqi,6erjqi,,"No, I don't. And quite frankly, I'm getting pretty tired of hearing that narrative.

First of all, let me say that I am pretty happy with my personal life. Me and my wife frequently go to the movies, hike the mountains, hang at the beach, visit museums and whatnot. I love to cook, play videogames, work out regularly, have many friends and occasionally get to drink copious amounts of beer. So although working at SpaceX can get rough from time to time, it's hardly fair to say that my life outside work sucks.

Nevertheless, working at SpaceX (and supposedly the same can be said for Tesla) can be extremely hard, challenging and stressful. Expectations are high, days are often long and I probably could get paid more elsewhere. So yeah, sure; I think it's fair to say that my job has affected my personal life quite a bit, and many of the horror stories you've heard are probably true, at least to some extent. But I truly detest the idea that Elon is some sort of slave-master, exploiting young souls under dangerous and unhealthy working conditions at sub-par wages, all so he can line his pockets with profits. That is just pure bullshit.

Naturally, working at SpaceX will not be for everyone.

comment,7e2ze2,7e2ze2,,"Bugatti hasn’t even attempted top speed in their car yet. The 261 is just what they limit the car to right now for their customers.

Everyone knows it will be 280mph+, the question is can they find new tires that let them reach 300.

If you read Motor Trend’s review of the Chiron, they said a $180k Turbo S would accelerate as fast in 0-60, but the Chiron feels to accelerate faster from 60-180mph than it does 0-60, that’s where most of the power delivery is.

It’s odd that Tesla only bragged about 0-60 and 0-100mph numbers, for most hyper cars that aim for 250mph+ top speed, they brag about 0-124, 60-150, or 0-200mph time, that’s where the differences lie. 

Actually they mostly brag about lap times around the Nurburgring, since that’s a better indicator of the overall performance of a vehicle.  

One big concern with EV in this context is that due to the nature of EV, a powerful car would require a big battery pack, and current battery technology means it will be a very heavy battery pack. Weight is public enemy number one as far as motor sport engineering is concerned, so the Roadster's track performance is still a big question mark at this point. I personally think if they solve the battery cooling issue, it should be very respectable, but very, very unlikely to be record setting considering some of the [bat shit insane stuff](https://jalopnik.com/the-1000-horsepower-mercedes-amg-project-one-this-is-1803141648) that's coming out right around the same time.",1975,True,1511124011.0,2017-11-19 21:40:11,2666,0,cookingboy,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7e2ze2/tesla_vs_bugatti/dq24dq8/,True,,2017,tesla,top,False,False,0,dq24dq8

Tesla still need to deliver on their promises but until then, this is still in the *potential* category of game-changers. 

I don’t wanna sound like a nay-sayer because I’m far from that, but i also don’t want to fall in the trap of being a blind fan. 

Edit: 

There's been a few replies to this comment and another comment about my ""cautiously optimistic"" statement. I'll try to reply to those comments as well but I wanted to add an edit here to get ahead of the ""you're wrong"" replies. 

My comment here is not meant to say that Tesla will not fulfill their promise, nor am I trying to argue that Tesla is not currently in a good situation. I'm just addressing the comment that the Semi will put Tesla in a good situation. I believe the Semi **can** put Tesla in a good situation but as of right now, it can't do much other than fuel the hype. There are no Tesla's on the road transporting goods, or even Tesla semis in production, it's simply a POC right now and trying to shake up the industry. 

So again, I'll reiterate what my comment was originally trying to say. The Semi *can* be a big deal, the Semi *can* become a game-changer, the Semi *can* put Tesla in a good situation, but as of December 19 2017, the Tesla Semi is simply just another proof of concept similar to the [Nikola Corp](https://nikolamotor.com/one) electric semi.",1402,False,1513693981.0,2017-12-19 15:33:01,606,0,Ragnar_Targaryen,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7ktg18/ups_preorders_125_tesla_electric_trucks/drh09ma/,True,,2017,tesla,top,False,False,0,drh09ma

comment,81xi87,81xi87,,"Your comment had me wondering, how expensive is it really? Obviously the Tesla's are luxury priced, but then again isn't Europe the place where people get taxi'ed in Mercedes? Can the alledged lower running costs of a Tesla Model S make up the cost difference? I dug around and found this

According to [this source](https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/Netherlands/diesel_prices/), the average diesel price in the Netherlands for the past few months has been 1,27 euros per liter, that's $5.9/gallon. Gasoline is even worse, 1.55 euros per liter or $7.22/gallon, but for the sake of the argument let's go with diesel.

According to [this source](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/8/8c/Electricity_prices%2C_first_half_of_year%2C_2015-2017.png), the average **household** price of a kWh of energy in the Netherlands in the 1st semester of last year was 0.156 euros per kWh, non-household is considerably lower, but let's go with worst case scenario.

The first Model S seen in the picture has a 85 kWh battery, according [to this source](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=32557) to be good enough for 265 miles, or 426 km. But let's go with 400 km to round it down, that's 4.7 km per kWh

Now let's find a comparable car to match the Tesla against.

It's not that the car has extra battery cells, is that they limit the charge capacity of each cell to improve durability.

All your Li-ion battery devices do the same as to increase the number of cycles the battery will last.

Really the easiest thing is another equity raise, their marketcap is still over $44B and they could raise another $2B+ to deal with this problem and buy some extra runway for less than 5% dilution.  Of course Elon has been resisting that too, insisting last CC that the company would be able to self finance everything except for maybe a small debt raise in China for their Chinese factory.  I doubt that'll happen given the problems with their logistics network, autopilot/FSD and continued need for growth capex though.

Their deliver/production report seemed to be trying to justify another capital raise pretty heavily so I think we should expect to hear about one in the Q3 ER or CC.

post,9p819m,,Tesla Model X 1000 mile road-trip report,"I thought I’d write a review of a Tesla Model X for the sub from the perspective of a V8 loving petrolhead. There’s a lot of hate on here, and even more misinformation, so I thought I’d give the car a chance. 

I’ve just spent 5 days with a 75D and done over 1000 miles. The car was a 2016 with Gen 1 Autonomous tech, 68,000 miles on the clock, and a 200 mile range battery. 

My last big drive was in a 3.0D Range Rover Velar, and the road-trip car before that was a Merc C63 AMG V8 Bi-turbo. I’ve owned 15+ cars, many over 400bhp, and driven dozens more in Europe, UAE and the US. 

The car was booked through Turo. This was for a road-trip from Vegas to San Diego and back, so some days I was doing around 350 miles. Other days I started in the city center of SD and then drove to attractions in and outside the city. I covered all kinds of roads, but the vast majority were freeway and city driving. 

Originally I’d booked a BMW i8 to do the trip, but the car was apparently totaled two days before my booking, so the Model X was a last-minute alternative. I’m aware of how unreliable Turo bookings can be, so I had my eyes on a Tesla as a replacement in case of issues. 

---

**First the bad.** 

This car has a massive blind spot. Within 10 minutes of being in the car I was blasted with horn as I nearly wiped out some poor fucker in a SUV. It seems this blind spot exists when in Autopilot too, as it sometimes happened when the car was autonomously changing lanes. 

There’s a wonderful driver’s display that shows the car in relation to the lanes, the cars, trucks, and bikes around it. But the icons of passing cars only appear once they are a car-length in front of the Tesla. With the blind spot issue, it would be super duper useful if this showed cars beside the Model X! 

Anyway, I quickly came to respect the danger, and learned to not trust the mirrors or autopilot.",11257,True,1539858681.0,2018-10-18 12:31:21,6660,1560,[deleted],cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/9p819m/tesla_model_x_1000_mile_roadtrip_report/,True,0.91,2018,tesla,top,False,False,0,

comment,9tudw8,9tudw8,,"The loan was very important, but there was another important event that kept Tesla from bankruptcy. It was a Tesla financing round on Christmas Eve, 2008. Tesla board member, Steve Jurvetson called it ""the most extraordinary act of entrepreneurial zeal and commitment I've ever seen.""

&#x200B;

The financing round was falling apart because the entire global economy appeared to be on brink of collapse, and investors were extremely skittish about investing in a car startup that was on the verge of bankruptcy. At the last hour, Elon essentially said, ""screw it, I'll personally finance the entire round."" Elon was willing to go net negative on his net worth to save Tesla. This changed the mood in the room and the round closed.

Seems I didn't describe the situation clearly and some are getting fussy and making incorrect assumptions.

comment,ag6r2f,ag6r2f,,"> Many of our members including me e-mailed Tesla about this and all we got was 'You are an unsupported market so we won't even update your timezone.' 

I think it's too bad that you are not getting the support you want. However, I think the answer to why this is happening is hidden in this reply right here. It may well be that Tesla (or their advisers) have come to the conclusion that if they start creating solutions for the Turkish market, the will have ""entered that market"", and therefore be obliged to provide additional support to Turkish Tesla owners, follow specific Turkish regulations etc. 

In other words, fixing a small issue in relation to Turkey might bring other consequences with it for the company. Not saying I agree with that stance, and of course I think it'd be really good if Tesla entered all markets to help move everyone to a sustainable mode of transport, but it may be the explanation.

For absolutely sure. For the record, steering out of the way like that should not be a human's gut reaction because if you steer into oncoming traffic (particularly a highway) it could lead to a significantly worse crash, and on top of that you would be 100% liable for any crash/damage that occurred as a result of that maneuver. If the autopilot was able to reliably determine there was no oncoming car and steer out of the way to avoid the front end collision, that is a really good outcome!

When the cops arrived I just told the cop(s) that I had a video when he needed it and was let go (the cops didn't want us to stay for fear of another accident).  When the police called me I had this clip ready (I only noticed the White Model 3 getting hit when I pulled the video).  Cop told me the Durango driver claimed he was swerving to avoid a speeding car behind him when the accident occurred and none of the other drivers knew what happened. Luckily I was able to prove he was a liar and I am a formal witness to the accident with my footage attached to the report.  

The Cop did ask how I was able to provide all the footage so I told him its standard on Teslas.

Update/additional information since I am seeing the same questions. 

Filming capabilities: What I showed is a standard option* on all Model 3s. You have to set up the ability to record using a formatted USB drive (FAT32) and a folder on the drive called TeslaCam. YouTube has many tutorials on setting it up. Other Tesla did not have dash cam set up. He had 7,500 miles on his car (2k more than mine) hadn’t looked into dash-cam yet.

Apparently he hired an EU Rocket Scientist named Jim Cantrell to teach him rocketry. Cantrell said Elon was the smartest scientist he had ever met and could repeat sections of the book verbatim. Which says a lot coming from a guy that spends his life surrounded by scientists. 

>(Interviewer) You have worked with Tesla and SpaceX founder, Elon Musk, in the past. I think it’s difficult for the public to perceive a figure like Elon Musk. Hype or Genius?

>(Cantrell) Elon is the real deal. Transformational people come from ordinary walks of life. He is certainly a transformational person. He represents that nomadic part of our species that is enormously powerful. He’s unlike anyone I’ve ever known. He’s by far the smartest guy I’ve ever known. He’s also the most motivated and ambitious person I’ve ever met. His desire, as he puts it, to make humanity a multi-planetary species is deeply ingrained, and he will either do it or die trying.

Ford invented the modern assembly line, but Toyota truly modernized it. They basically wrote the book on modern manufacturing. The Toyota Production System and Kaizen manufacturing and management philosophies are taught in universities all over the world. The grain mill and packaging plant I work in referenced it during expansion projects.

A near bankrupt Porsche in the early 90's hired a bunch of former Toyota engineers to redesign their plants which currently involved engineers climbing ladders to search shelves and sifting through part bins while working on a single car. One year after implementing Toyota's manufacturing practices, Porsche had reduced the build time to 72 hours per car from 120, and saw manufacturing mistakes and errors drop 50%.

comment,d25ver,d25ver,,"Person with a Disability here (powerchair user)-

The trick with making a wheelchair accessible Tesla would been 2 main engineering challenges to overcome: first being head room, most vehicles conversations accomplish this either raising the roof or dropping the floor. Dropping the floor tends to be the preferred method since the other tends to look like shit, doesn't make the vehicle more likely to flip, and makes the other engineering challenge easier. The second challenge is getting the chair in. Most lowered floor vehicles use a bi fold ramp or an in floor ramp that slides out automatically (mine has this). The downside of this is the floor is slightly higher, not much though. The lowered floor makes the slope easier and also have a ""kneel"" option to make it even easier (mine does this but it's off since I don't need it, because powerchair, and it's one less thing to break). Raised roof vehicles have to a lift in some form which is it's own complexity. 

The other issues are easy to figure out. You'd need a door, [Braun's Ford Explorer conversation does this well](https://www.themobilityresource.com/uploaded/blog/images/Braunability-MXV-secondary.jpg). You'd also need a floor system with a track to lock in accessories (chair straps, EZ Locks, seat belt holders, passenger seats).  That's easy. You'll also want to make the controls each to adapt for those with hand control setups. 

If Telsa can lower the floor in a Model X, then I think it'd work.",1976,True,1568148404.0,2019-09-10 22:46:44,23,0,Fp_Guy,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/d25ver/tesla_summon_is_a_gimmickk_thx_bi/ezuah4j/,True,,2019,tesla,top,False,False,0,ezuah4j

comment,e1os5v,e1os5v,,"Sad to see this sub ragging on Neil here...

The fact is that Neil has a point, the Ford is a RWD that is a lot heavier over the front axel. The Cybertruck is an AWD that has even distribution of weight. Cybertruck would not have won in such a large margin if the bed of the F-150 was loaded with stuff, therefore giving more traction to the rear wheels.

In a more recent tweet he acknowledges the fact that, fully laden, Cyber truck wins out due to torque.

People here are pretending that Neil knows nothing about basic physics. He has a doctorate degree in astrophysics for crying out loud. Sometimes he says some cringe things, sure, but that doesn't give the right to disregard someones viewpoint who is likely a lot smarter than the average human.

They had a slight twitter kerfuffle, that's it.

One minute of this guys time is worth more than 100 iPhones. His phone will work for sure no matter what or else there are 4 more ready to go with his data synced to them over cellular data.  Theres no price you can put on that level of reliability as a standard feature and it absolutely makes sense that people's who time and data are worth more than mine or your net worth will use the most expensive and reliable hardware, software, and services. It would be irresponsible not to.

But that's rich people. What about poor techies? The most techie people I know are often the least elitist and the ones that were elitist were almost exclusively assholes in other aspects of their personality as well.  Flagship devices have gotten to the point that they are mostly limited by the capabilities of the user and the differences between apple and android are almost arbitrary outside of specific preference and perhaps a slight hardware advantage to apple for reliability and replacement cost and advantage to android for software openeness and versatility.

Yeah, so it's ***production*** that matters, not deliveries/sales.

Here's the historic Tesla production numbers table [I posted over at /r/teslainvestorsclub as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/fg6uwh/elon_congratulations_tesla_team_on_making_our/fk3fey2/):

    year | Tesla vehicle production
       -- | --
    -2011 | ~2,500 (early Roadster)
     2012 |   3,100
     2013 |  23,187
     2014 |  35,000
     2015 |  51,095
     2016 |  83,922
     2017 | 101,027
     2018 | 254,530
     2019 | 365,232
   **total**  | **919,593** vehicles
     March 9 | 1,000,000-919,593 = 80,407
     **Q1'2020 full** | **110,400** (est.)


There's another 3 weeks left in March, and with Fremont production at 7k/week and GF3 production at 3k/week there will probably/possibly be another ~30k vehicles made in this quarter - this is the basis of the 110,400 estimate in the final line.",2201,True,1583831320.0,2020-03-10 10:08:40,129,0,__Tesla__,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/fg6smp/elon_congratulations_tesla_team_on_making_our/fk3fqt5/,True,,2020,both,top,False,False,0,fk3fqt5

post,gbmxxr,,Musk tweet knocks $14bn off Tesla market value,"Article: https://www.ft.com/content/90eca82e-498e-4145-91a7-6b19cfe49170

> Elon Musk tweeted a complaint about Tesla’s share price that wiped $14bn off the company’s stock market value on Friday morning.

	Tesla did not immediately confirm whether Mr Musk’s tweet had been given legal clearance, and did not respond to a question about whether the company currently has a general counsel. Tesla lost three general counsels last year, one of them quitting after only two months.


	The Tesla boss, who has 33m followers on Twitter, issued his curt verdict on his company’s shares early in the morning in California on Friday, writing: “Tesla stock price is too high imo.”

Within moments the Tesla share price started sinking, dropping 10 per cent over the course of an hour before recovering slightly. The sharp move comes in what has been a hugely volatile period for Tesla’s shares. They slumped more than 60 per cent after coronavirus hit, but then rebounded by 120 per cent.

post,i4k78c,,"Entirety of Nikola’s $36,000 quarterly revenue was from solar panel installation for the executive chairman.","https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/05/nikolas-entire-quarterly-revenue-of-36000-was-from-solar-installation-for-the-executive-chairman.html

People are comparing them to pets.com, but I don’t think even that company was this blatant at ripping investors off. Their “quarterly report” might as well have been a fat middle finger to both their investors and the SEC.

Oh btw the company is worth around $15B... and some analysts are saying it’s a “buying opportunity” given today’s dip.

**Edit**: for more context on the Pets.com comparison:

Pets.com had annual revenue of $619k for first year, and reached a market cap of $400M at its highest. Crazy bubble right?

Well Nikola has annual revenue of less than $100k (maybe a bit more depends on how many more solar panels the CEO is gonna order for his houses lmao), but reached market cap of $30B at its highest.

It’s literally 500 times more overvalued than the most infamous bubble stock during the dotcom crisis.

**Edit 2**: For the people who argue how revenue doesn't matter because they are the next Tesla.

For comparison. Tesla was founded in 2003 and 5 years later the original Tesla Roadster was on sale. They didn't go IPO until 2 years after that. Elon Musk also had a decent track record, being a co-founder and CEO of this small startup called PayPal.

Meanwhile Nikola Motors was founded in 2004, by a businessman with no real education whose resume is ""fluffy"" at best, and their six years of ""industry leading product development"" has yielded some fantastic CG renderings. 

Can Nikola be the next Tesla? Never say never, especially in the year 2020. But my bet is that Trevor Milton is closer to Elizabeth Holmes than Elon Musk.

**Edit 3** Ahahahaha apparently Trevor gave out more update of their factory construction (remember production is supposed to start in 2021) at yesterday's quarterly call...and drum roll......

post,ipp3e9,,Don't be fooled. This IS The Market Crash: My DD.,"I've been researching this a LOT lately because I didn't want to get caught in it. Looking at trends and past data. I believe, strongly, that we're in the middle of the market crash. I used my knowledge and was able to fully exit my entire $500k portfolio on Tuesday, maintaining all my gains. I've even taken a sizeable position in SPY puts ($50k worth of Dec $260). I got my close friends out (well the ones who listened) on Friday at the first sign of positive movement.

First of all, a little history lesson on the [Minksy Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsky_moment#/media/File:Stylized_Minsky_Cycle.PNG). It's basically a theory for how market bubbles happen. It occurs in 5 steps. I will outline what they are in basic and how the current market looks in relation.

1. **Displacement**: This is the beginning of a new paradigm where the market changes in a big way. For this, that was the Coronavirus. This took place between February to April.
2. **Boom**: Increase in spending begins and major gains start to be made. Media attention and market involvement begin to increase. Currently, we've seen a HUGE increase in retail traders (who are extremely volatile) and massive media attention toward the stock market as it relates to corona news as well as stimulus and recovery speed gains. This took place between April and July.
3. **Euphoria**: People stop caring about any sort of reasonable investment strategy and just start throwing money at stuff. Tesla is a fantastic example of this, but many other stocks in the tech sector are guilty of this. July was the beginning of this phase as Tesla saw insane growth within a few week period and other companies followed suit very quickly. This continued into late August with Apple and Tesla going to stupid prices after their splits, and all the other big tech names reaching wild valuations.
4. **Profit Taking**: Smart money starts withdrawing funds from the market as they prepare for the crash.",13162,True,1599685339.0,2020-09-09 23:02:19,7748,1650,[deleted],stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ipp3e9/dont_be_fooled_this_is_the_market_crash_my_dd/,True,0.88,2020,tesla,top,False,False,0,
comment,ipp3e9,ipp3e9,,"I think your framework is correct, but your analysis is wrong. Here are some inconsistencies I noticed in your theory:

When you say:

>**Catalysts**: These are are things required to trigger a bubble collapse. Almost every bubble has had some notable catalyst(s) to trigger the rapid decline. As mentioned in Profit Taking, **we've had three catalysts occur so far that triggered panic selling. New Tesla shares, secondary Tesla offloading, and Softbank.** They are the big one and who I will focus on for a minute.

Why do you think Tesla stock split + dilution is a catalyst for the market crash? I don't think that makes sense. As for Softbank, they bought calls in mainly the FAANG stocks, they didn't buy Calls on the whole market. Could Tech stocks crashing back to say, April levels, bring us back to SPY under 300? Sure. But re-test and breach the March lows? No way, not with the amount of liquidity sloshing around out there with 0% Interest Rates.

&#x200B;

>Market cap to GDP was 2:1 at peak. The dotcom crash was 1.4 and the recession was 1.1. Currently 1.77:1.

The Wilshire Index (AKA the ""Buffet Indicator"") is outdated and no longer relevant in my opinion. It's supposed to be a measure of US domiciled publicly traded companies Market Cap vs the GDP of the US.

It's very interesting that the bull and bear traps look exactly the same and they exist very close to each other on the spectrums (the bear trap basically leads right into the bull trap, post blow-off.). That's totally where my issue lies in my own argument. I wasn't sure if this was another violent shake-off leading into the last phase or if it was the crash itself. I'm still not entirely convinced it's not the crash though. Like you said, there needs to be confirmation one way or another.

It really doesn't take much to start a bubble crashing. One thing can cause others to compound on each other. Catalysts don't all have to be covid level to trigger a collapse. Looking into the dotcom bust, the catalyst was money managers urging their clients to rebalance their portfolios. That looks awfully similar to Tesla's second largest stockholder doing the same. Nothing is ever the same twice, and it's totally ridiculous to count Tesla as the main driver of this, but at the same time, they represent the emotional sentiment of this market as a whole.

post,j59ovh,,So Tesla's quality control is embarrassingly bad. Our brand new model Y's roof just fell off,"My dad bought a brand new model Y today, and he brought me along to pick it up just in case he needed help with any tech problems. Everything was going fine and we were driving back home when we started to hear a ton of wind. I thought maybe a window was open but a minute later the entire glass roof just blew off. After a brief panic we turned around and drove the new Tesla convertible back to the dealership.

When we got back we called highway patrol to tell them that there was a car roof somewhere on the 580, but somebody might have gotten into an accident, I’m not sure. The manager at the dealership said that either the seal for the roof was faulty, or the factory just ... forgot to seal the roof on? I can’t imagine how something as big as the roof not being attached could make it past quality control. If this is a recurring problem a lot of people could get hurt. Has this ever happened before?

&#x200B;

Edit: The manager offered to get the car serviced for free, but we declined and are probably going to get an entirely new car. Whether we're still getting a Tesla is up to my dad but probably not.

post,kpeffw,,Reasons We May Not Be in a Bubble,"I'm seeing a lot of posts comparing this to the 2000 dot-com bubble. Here's a breakdown of why we're likely not anywhere close to 2000 levels of craziness.

**First:**  During the dot-com era, the Nasdaq Composite's price-to-earnings valuation ran up as high as 200. By comparison, the index's P/E today is a relatively tame 28, only modestly higher from 23 at the end of 2019. 

**Second:** Interest rates were a very attractive 6% which provided a strong alternative to stocks. No such outlet exists today unless you trust bitcoin, or want to invest in paper gold.

**Third:** Much of the value gains we're seeing in the market can be tied directly to the fact that people who invest are making similar or better money this year, and spending significantly less causing them to save more and invest more:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html)

**Fourth:** The rest of the growth can largely be attributed to increased liquidity from all of the money printing. Stocks tend to mirror an increase in the money supply with their value making them a great hedge against inflation. The valuations of the 2000s weren't backstopped by QE or increased savings, making them much shakier.

**Fifth:** The money printing will likely go on for a while. People mistakenly assume we're printing against our 22T dollar economy when we're really printing against the 80-100T global economy for which are the reserve currency. A weak dollar benefits the global economy, and benefits us because we are the trading floor for the global economy.

This is a long but very illuminating read on why QE is necessary and actually helpful:

comment,kpeffw,kpeffw,,"Perhaps we are indeed due for a dramatic correction. I think the difference for this ""bubble"" is in the quality/quantity of the underlying companies behind the securities.

In the dotcom bubble, there was a plethora of companies for every problem -- and they all promised to be the end-all, be-all.

Today, there are only a few companies for every problem -- and the reason the companies are worth so much is because there is no doubt that they deserve the faith bestowed upon then.

If I believe in online retail as an industry worth investing in, wouldn't a wise investment be Amazon? Would you say I'm being unwise to put money in Facebook if I want to invest in social media and marketing? Sure, there are other players that cover bases that the biggest companies don't do well enough -- but they are niche cases.

Even Tesla, which is arguably overvalued, is a company with great promise. If I had to put my eggs in the basket of a company that I believe will solve our transportation needs for the foreseeable future, it's them. Really, the main thing that's going to cause their valuation to pop is if they prove themselves to be unworthy of our faith.

Perhaps a good analogy would be: *In the 90s, we had a million Nikolas. Today, it’s a million Tesla shareholders.*

comment,kpeffw,kpeffw,,"The investment thesis *isn’t* that we will all be driving EVs tomorrow, or in 5 years.

The investment thesis is that Tesla will be on the forefront of the EVs that we are driving. They will hold patents and intellectual property that will influence the entire auto industry in terms of decades.

Their battery technology will reinvent the way we think about every electronic device. Their solar innovations, everything we thought about power generation.

Think about it: Plenty of companies are trying to make a good EV. Plenty are trying to develop autonomous vehicles. Tesla isn’t trying to get us all in an EV in 5 years — they *fully anticipate* that our cars will drop us off for work, and then go transport other people before picking us up at the end of the day.

I really think that Musk is the Steve Jobs of transportation. If there’s a better way to do things entirely, he can see it, and he heads straight for it. He doesn’t chip away at incremental improvements to an unsatisfactory model; he makes the incremental improvements necessary to achieve the ideal solution.

Now, Tesla has plenty of wood to chop to get there. But is an investor’s faith misguided? Is there another company that is a wiser choice?

post,l3z5jq,,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

comment,l7fw2f,l7fw2f,,"First of all, I'll note that I'm not an expert in this, but here's my understanding. I'm sure someone will correct me quickly enough if I'm wrong (the fastest way to find something out on the internet: say it wrong, and someone will rapidly scream at you how much of an idiot you are)

Unfortunately there's no nice easy ""story time"" analogy like short selling to help explain it super simply. But Puts and Calls are fairly easy concepts anyway, with ways to over-complicate them. The simple version, in both cases, is you're paying a premium/fee now, in order to be able to buy (call) or sell (put) at a fixed price in future.

You pay the fee either way, and it's non-refundable. In return, you are given an ""option"" (choice) of whether you want to execute your put/call in future. That's where the name ""Option"" comes from - you're buying an option to buy/sell at a fixed price in future.

For example I might think TSLA is going to rise in price in the next year, but I want to limit my losses to 20% of my current holding in case I'm wrong. I can buy a Put Option on TSLA at, say, 90% of the current price, and pay a fee of about 10% of the current price. Then in a year, I have an option to sell my TSLA shares at 90% of the current price. I'm down my fee and the 10% loss, but if the price has dropped to 50% in a year, I've massively reduced my risk. The downside being that if the price goes up 20% in a year, I'm only actually up 10% because I've paid a fee for my Option.",2531,True,1611893728.0,2021-01-29 05:15:28,142,0,audigex,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/l7fw2f/elon_burn_ouch/gl6ydp8/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,gl6ydp8

post,l7qlfh,,Gamestop Big Picture: The Short Singularity Pt 3 - WTF edition," *Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low (average \~$67--I have to admit, the drop today was too tasty so my cost basis went up from yesterday)/share with my later buys averaged in), and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.  In this post I will go a little further and speculate more than I'd normally do in a post due to the questions I've been getting, so fair warning, some of it might be very wrong.

Today was a study in the power of fear, courage, and the levers you can pull when you wield billions of dollars...

Woops, excuse me. I'm sorry hedge fund guys... I meant trillions of dollars--I just briefly forget you control not just your own but a lot of other peoples' money too for a moment there.

Also, for people still trading this on market-based rationale (as I am), it was a good day to measure the conviction behind your thesis.  I like to think I have conviction, but in case you are somehow not yet familiar with the legend of DFV, you need to see these posts (fair warning, nsfw, and some may be offended/triggered by the crude language).",36029,True,1611920767.0,2021-01-29 12:46:07,7133,1662,jn_ku,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/,True,0.98,2021,both,top,False,False,0,
comment,l7qlfh,l7qlfh,,"Yeah... So I've found a pretty massive wrench in everyone's thesis.

The short interest results that were posted 1/27 were actually settled 1/15. There has been enough volatility in the past 2 weeks for shorts to easily close out without anyone noticing. If that's true, it would make sense for them (or anyone) to short again while above 300, especially if they knew the original 61 million shorts were already cleared.

People also keep saying ""Days to Cover is still 2.5!"" Yeah, that doesn't mean anything in a volatile market like this. Days to Cover, aka Short Interest, is a function of (Shares Shorted) / (Avg Volume). Avg volume is over the past 30 days. The first 15 of the past 30 days saw much lower volume. Current Short Ratio is closer to 0.5-1. If they could cover their entire positions in 1 day (causing a spike obviously), who's to say they didn't clear over a 10 day period (causing the spikes we saw), then, knowing they lost $4 billion (if cleared around the $62 price range, which I suspect), why not take out new short positions around $300? The price can't go up any more if there's no short squeeze coming.

Just my 2 cents. I get downvoted for this on WSB, so it's apparent no one wants to objectively discuss this very real possibility.

Gamestop on the other hand, anyone with half a brain and an internet account knows doesn't have much of a business model anymore (certainly not something to justify current valuation levels) so sooner or later people (even the amateurs) are going to realize that its in a price bubble unrelated to its fundamentals.

Normally this belongs in the daily advice thread, but because of recent events and concerns over Robinhood’s ability to serve customer(I been telling y’all for years) we can have a thread in it


So here we are: recommend and discuss brokers, fees, features, mobile apps, whatever.  In general I think everyone is best served by Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard.  TD is another major player but for those unaware they are in the process of being acquired by schwab.  All three of those actually have phone numbers where you can call and speak to a person about your account.

For the younger crowd; a phone call is similar to voice to text, but instantaneous. 

Also, feel free to chat apps or whatever too,

post,lcftzc,,10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.",9257,True,1612445969.0,2021-02-04 14:39:29,4138,498,pmchem,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lcftzc/10_interesting_and_useful_etfs_with_less_than_1b/,True,0.98,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,

I was thinking about this in relation to the [beta invite](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/27/spacex-starlink-service-priced-at-99-a-month-public-beta-test-begins.html) I got.   Any other company would have had it go through a marketing department, get corporate colors applied, and be A/B tested through like 12 rounds of revisions. 

It was obvious that someone at SpaceX was just like, ""This is funny send it out!""  

And you know what?  It worked well.  All those designs and revisions and everything else would have slowed down the process, and cost money and not actually added any value. 

If you think about those types of operations happening thousands of ways throughout an Elon company, you begin to see why they can get things to market faster than their competitors, and be more efficient. 

The actual beta experience has been really good.  Took us from ~8mbps to 150mbps.  Early on it had pretty regular downtime (about a few minutes every hour), but it's been improving regularly.  

It'll be interesting to see if speeds/performance suffer as more users are added, but if they can keep delivering the experience we've had, I have no doubt it'll be a long term success, at least from a demand standpoint.",1723,True,1612891039.0,2021-02-09 18:17:19,213,0,AtOurGates,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lg54b5/spacex_begins_accepting_99_preorders_for_its/gmptuxq/,True,,2021,elon,top,False,False,0,gmptuxq

comment,lgdnqj,lgdnqj,,"It looks great on paper, and it is great don't get me wrong (probably the best and most impactful car in the last like 30 years), but having driven the Taycan it's just several levels above both Model 3 and Model S in terms of driving. It handles like a Porsche. It's fucking fantastic. Plus it feels immensely, immensely more luxurious and better inside its cabin.

Model 3 is no slouch when it comes to handling but it's not close to that level.

Plus the Taycan it's a lot faster and has a way more comparable range to the Model 3 than it looks on paper.

All of this is to say that, even the fact that you could compare the two is crazy, I'll agree with you.

The real comparisons that are ridiculously skewed to Model 3's favor are the ones that compare it to other luxury performance sedans at the same point, though. Like the Model 3 Performance is so much above those in terms of speed, practicality, and features, that one wonders why the hell would anybody buy anything else. ""but muh luxurious lookin cabin"" being pretty much the only obvious reason.

Other reasons that are legit but not obvious are: Tesla's ridiculous service process, bad customer service, general build consistency, terrible fans, Elon Musk,",1223,False,1612908391.0,2021-02-09 23:06:31,193,0,obvnotlupus,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/lgdnqj/tesla_keeps_the_bragging_rights/gmqykl0/,True,,2021,both,top,False,False,0,gmqykl0

post,lm2mry,,"BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, is starting to ""dabble"" in Bitcoin","https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/blackrock-has-started-to-dabble-in-bitcoin-says-rick-rieder.html

BlackRock’s Rick Rieder told CNBC on Wednesday the world’s largest asset manager has begun entering the bitcoin space.

The remarks from Rieder, who is BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, came on the same day bitcoin broke above $51,000 for the first time.

“Today the volatility of it is extraordinary, but listen, people are looking for storehouses of value,” Rieder said on “Squawk Box.” “People are looking for places that could appreciate under the assumption that inflation moves higher and that debts are building, so we’ve started to dabble a bit into it.”

In January, BlackRock added bitcoin futures as an potential investment for two of its funds, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The funds are BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities and BlackRock Global Allocation Fund.

A number of other financial institutions, such as BNY Mellon and Mastercard, have made entrances into the crypto space in recent days. BNY Mellon, the nation’s oldest bank, will launch a digital assets unit later this year, while Mastercard intends to support certain cryptocurrencies on its formal network.

Electric vehicle maker Tesla also announced last week it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin using cash on its balance sheet and intends to begin accepting the digital coin as payment for its products.

The price of bitcoin has risen more than 70% this year, adding to a major rally that began in the fall. “My sense is the technology has evolved and the regulation has evolved to the point where a number of people find it should be part of the portfolio, so that’s what’s driving the price up,” Rieder said.

Despite bitcoin’s growing respectability as an asset class, Rieder said Wednesday that how much exposure an investor should have “depends on what the rest of your portfolio looks like.",2314,True,1613590487.0,2021-02-17 20:34:47,3644,1453,PZinger6,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lm2mry/blackrock_the_worlds_largest_money_manager_is/,True,0.97,2021,tesla,top,False,True,0,

post,lqfhuz,,Technology stocks are crashing – what now,"A friend just messaged me saying that his portfolio lost 10% of its value recently and that this was complete doomsday. Judging by the futures, the NQ is down 6.8% from its highs (a 1.8% gap down this morning alone). I get that, it's frustrating.

It is also noteworthy that the sell-off hurts technology stocks in particular. But mind that they were also the largest beneficiary in recent months:

* Nasdaq 100 is 53% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* S&P 500 is 31% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* DJIA is 19% above its weekly 200 EMA.

Which one is going to be hurt first and foremost once a correction is underway? Of course it's going to be the most stretched industry sector. Information technology is 28% of the S&P 500, and 20% of the DJIA.

If you buy stocks, you've got to have conviction in them. You've got to know what you are buying. Am I going to dump all my holdings just because they're ""overvalued"". Of course not. I'm going to hang in there with stocks going down 30% and then come back up 80%. Even if that takes another 3 years. It's the nature of the market and it is great at weeding out the less convinced.

Volatility is the price you pay for your returns.

If you held Apple all these years, you are sitting on a fortune now. Same goes for Amazon and many other megabrands of today. Amazon went top to bottom 60% several times in its history. You've got to have conviction in what you're buying to hold onto such kind of volatility. I also go to the grocery store to pick my favorite marmalade brand. If there's a 30% discount I'll pile up. But you cannot ever pile up if you don't have conviction in your holdings in the first place.

So here's what I would do. Go through your portfolio name by name. Ask yourself why it's there in the first place. Start with ""I own XYZ because..."". Warren Buffett had also advised it in one of his interviews. If you can't tell that story, sell it off. It doesn't belong in your portfolio.",2027,True,1614076976.0,2021-02-23 11:42:56,4057,1583,trendarchitect,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lqfhuz/technology_stocks_are_crashing_what_now/,True,0.94,2021,elon,top,False,False,0,
comment,lqfhuz,lqfhuz,,"Bonds are always being sold just like stocks are. Stocks have the stock market, bonds have the bond market.

Yields are going up because inflation is going up. If you are buying debt, and inflation is rising faster than the interest rate, then you're essentially _paying_ the borrower for access to your money. So bond buyers are demanding higher interest rates right now, causing yields to increase as well.

Then your super safe index investor begins to look at historically high bond yields compared to SPY and it's risks, and decides to invest in bond indexes. This outflow causes SPY and it's components to go lower. Someone that was invested in TSLA will look at how low SPY is and it's relative security, and invest into that.

post,lt7oop,,JPMorgan advises clients to expose 1% of their portfolio to Bitcoin,"In a recent note to clients, strategists from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) suggested a one percent portfolio allocation to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

As reported by Bloomberg, JPM strategists Joyce Chang and Amy Ho opined that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against fluctuations from traditional assets like bonds, stocks, and commodities. However, they advised clients to allocate a small percentage due to the risk of major downturns in Bitcoin’s value.

After setting a new all-time high above $58,000, the value of the digital asset slumped to less than $45,000 and has been struggling to recover ever since.

Chang and Ho told investors:

>*In a multi-asset portfolio, investors can likely add up to 1% of their allocation to cryptocurrencies in order to achieve any efficiency gain in the overall risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio.*

Bitcoin has welcomed major investments from the likes of Paul Tudor Jones, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and MicroStrategy. The endorsement from JPM comes at a time when institutional players are rushing to accumulate the digital asset. As per Bloomberg’s report, America’s oldest bank BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has also announced plans to enable Bitcoin transactions for its clients.

The strategists were quick to add that cryptocurrencies should be viewed as an investment vehicle and opposed to being funding currencies like the USD or EUR. This appears to be contrary to earlier statements from other JPM analysts that called cryptocurrencies the “poorest hedge for major drawdowns in equities.”

EDIT:

FINAL UPDATE - Apologies for taking so long to give an update here, I just wanted to wait to confirm whether this was an ongoing issue or not. Once Tesla got engaged, they were great about getting the car in quickly and doing all the diagnostic work they could think of. They had even seen my Reddit posts, so they were up to date on the situation without having to explain anything.

The weren’t able to replicate the issue, but wound up replacing the charge port anyway to be safe. The data from the car suggested a voltage spike during charging which caused the charge port to enter a fault  state and shut off. It’s unclear why the cord would not disengage, but I’m assuming it was able to do so once that fault cleared itself overnight. This makes some sense as it was pouring rain a few minutes prior to us charging, which I was told is the main culprit for this voltage spike fault.

Since then, we’ve had no issues with charging (knock on wood).",1585,True,1616133469.0,2021-03-19 06:57:49,1707,0,SeaEnergy,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/m8ac8v/130am_update_still_trapped_at_a_supercharger/grgbbix/,True,,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,grgbbix
comment,m8ac8v,m8ac8v,,"This will sound stupid but I didn’t see it happen in the video nor have I read all of the suggestions and in your other post I saw almost entirely only mentions of pulling on it as hard as you can so might I suggest pushing it back in? This is something I’ve seen happen before with even the mobile charger and wall connector as the latch can get stuck in the channel just like pins in a lock when attempting a lock pick (for lack of a better example). And again I am basing this purely off the video as it seems there is only outward force being applied to it so maybe you already do this and have done this for this case, BUT, I would suggest always lightly “jerking” the plug both in and out after and even a little before pressing the button. You can feel and hear the plug give a little as it slides in and out ever so slightly and hits the limits of the lock and the channel (which is another reason I am suggesting this is because I did not hear that in the video). This basically ensures that the channel is lined up and not pressed on the locking pin which is holding it in either by the angle it is pushing the locking pin or friction between the mechanism and the cable insert itself.

I got a call this morning around 11:30am from someone at Tesla Service. She had already seen this Reddit post, had read all of the updates, and had someone on their way to inspect the charging station.

I then dropped off the car this afternoon at the service center. Everyone there had seen this post as well and knew what was going on as soon as I arrived.

https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/softbank-says-unaware-of-sec-probe-into-securities-trading

On Wednesday, short seller research site PlainSite posted a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter revealing that the agency is investigating SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications company and investing giant notorious for financing various unprofitable “technology” companies like WeWork, Uber, Compass, and Oyo.

Aaron Greenspan, founder of the Think Computer Foundation that runs Plainsite, filed a FOIA request in December 2020 for ""any investigative materials [from January 1, 2018 to the present] pertaining to the various SoftBank companies controlled by Masayoshi Son, specifically relating to SoftBank's trading of stocks and derivatives on those stocks.""

This request was filed in response to the revelation last fall that SoftBank was the ""Nasdaq whale.” SoftBank was responsible for stoking a huge rally in tech stocks, the Financial Times reported, because around August it began buying billions of dollars worth of call options in a shift for the company, fueling a rally that pushed up the share prices of tech companies it held billions of dollars of equity in.

Thanks in large part to a rally sparked by SoftBank’s high-risk market plays, firms like Tesla and Apple were up 74 and 21 percent, respectively, in the month of August alone. Executed through a small desk of traders and chief executive Masayoshi Son himself, the trading unit―named SB Northstar―and its bets won the company some $4 billion in gains at the beginning of September, before quickly melting away into nearly $3 billion in losses by the end of the month.

In a January letter responding to Greenspan’s initial request, and months after the reporting on Softbank became public, the SEC said that its search did not turn up any relevant records.",3308,True,1616645951.0,2021-03-25 05:19:11,3379,340,rrdonoo,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mcpqqp/the_sec_confirms_it_is_investigating_softbank_for/,True,0.99,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,

post,n6dh3d,,I sold every share I own today.,"I got into the market last year post Covid around May or June. Since then it has been an absolute rollercoaster trying to pick stocks. I was up 100% on multiple stocks including Tesla, Carvana, Square, Fiverr. I didn't sell because you're supposed to hold for the long term I heard, only for those stocks and others over many months to drop 30% - 80% or more. I bought some new stocks in February only for them to then drop 30% or more in a matter of months. I have spent months this year and last inside on beautiful days going cross eyed staring at charts trying to figure out what stock to buy, what to sell, why this stock is going up, why this stock is going down. As we speak I'm sitting inside on a beautiful day writing this. I have admitted to myself I don't understand stocks. I don't understand businesses. I have reached a point where I stopped caring about losing money. That's a dangerous road I'm sure. With the amount of stocks I've bought and sold, I don't know if I'm up or down.

Evidence I don't understand stocks is that today Twitter is worth less than it was in 2013 when it IPO'd. One of the most popular social media apps in the entire world I would have assumed would be worth something. Apparently not. It may seem I'm impatient or have a short term horizon for the market, but if I bought Twitter in 2013, I would have wasted 8 years of my life holding it.

PLTR backed by Peter Thiel and signing multi-million dollar contracts week after week, well the bottom just fell out. While it will probably go back up, I don't understand when and why it would. If a company with that much growth potential can't go up, what chance does anything else have.

10 months ago I bought DKNG at $25 and sold a few months later for about $50. Today it's worth a little more than was 10 months ago. I'm glad I got out when I did.

So, I am buying the S&P.

post,ncc7gx,,23% of Tesla's Q1 earnings were from Bitcoin trading - and they would have missed earnings otherwise,"Title says it all.

Tesla's earnings in the first quarter were $438 million.

$101 million (23%) of that came from selling Bitcoin for profit.

The other interesting part is that it would have been an earnings miss without the trading.

Did one make the other happen?

Considering the recent news about not allowing Bitcoin anymore, it's certainly a move worth mentioning.

Look at the R&D spent. 100% up from last year. They *doubled* their R&D spend and still were able to beat earnings. That's the story apparently no one cares about. The Bitcoin sale is pure noise IMO. The vast majority of money made was spent to expand the company's production capacity.

post,nrw7cv,,Biden bans US investment in Chinese military and tech surveillance sectors,"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/03/biden-bans-us-investment-chinese-military-tech-surveillance

Joe Biden has signed an executive order that bans American entities from investing in dozens of Chinese companies with alleged ties to defense or surveillance technology sectors.

In a move that his administration says will expand the scope of a legally flawed Trump-era order, the US treasury will enforce and update on a “rolling basis” the new ban list of about 59 companies.

It also bars buying or selling publicly traded securities in target companies, and replaces an earlier list from the defense department, senior administration officials told reporters.


Chips with everything: how one Taiwanese company drives the world economy

The order prevents US investment from supporting the Chinese military-industrial complex, as well as military, intelligence, and security research and development programs, Biden said in the order.

“In addition, I find that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside [China] and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constitute unusual and extraordinary threats,” Biden said.

A White House fact sheet on the order said the policy would take effect for those companies listed on 2 August.

Major Chinese firms included on the previous defense department list were also placed on the updated list, including Aviation Industry Corp of China (AVIC), China Mobile Communications Group, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC).

SMIC is key to China’s national drive to boost its domestic chip sector.

That is over $5bn in assets **per employee of Tether**

If that seems comically low it's because it is. It's a world record for total amount of money managed per employee.

The only similarly small number of employees for such a large amount of money under management was Bernie Madoff's ponzi scheme, which had $50bn under management with just 25 employees. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoff_investment_scandal)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What benefit is there to having such a low number of employees? Lower costs yes but with the money they control and need to invest surely it would make sense for them to have more than just 13 employees doing this?

Or is it because it's easier for them to conceal fraud when there's only a handful of people being exposed to it and most of them have a large interest in keeping the fraud going.

comment,pkx5lf,pkx5lf,,"People aren't buying USDT with USD, they're buying buy USDT with cryptos. They convert their cryptos to USDT instead of USD because there are a lot of associated hassles if you're actually converting cryptos to fiat (losing capital because of associated fees, time delays to execute the transaction, you'll have to file taxes, liquidity problems etc etc)and also to safely park your crypto capital in cryptos but without the volatility . (like when Elon Musk decides to tweet something)
The only reason I see to buy USDT with usd is if you want to use an exchange that doesn't deal in fiat.

Say I bought 10$ worth of crypto and after the pump it is now worth 100$, before the dump I convert it to USDT (because I don't want to cash out , since I'm waiting for the next pump) , the concern here is whether the extra 90$ that came out of thin air is really backed by usd. That is , whether a company with ~25 employees producing no other product or service (other than USDT itself) has the capability to back ~60 billion usd worth of USDT with actual usd.



>They have done so with $1 USD or equivalent value of another currency

They claim that USDT is pegged to the dollar.

post,qi92fg,,"I made $500,000 trading stocks and options in 18 months. These are the 15 things I did that worked best.","I failed a lot while trading before, during, and after succeeding. I haven’t counted it up, but it’s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I’m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I’d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. 

These are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.

**Understand the Trading Environment**

One mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.

**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can’t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. 

In between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that’s more likely to pull back.  It’s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).

I try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly.",17822,True,1635500383.0,2021-10-29 11:39:43,7979,718,Swingtrader79,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qi92fg/i_made_500000_trading_stocks_and_options_in_18/,True,0.85,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,

You should always run the numbers yourself and with your financial planner to see it fit your needs and situation based on age, income, state, other factors, different investment objectives. 

Hell Yeah, put in $100/mo in a safer, simple, and stable S&P500(VOO) first . Keep it for life especially in a maxed out Roth IRA and, HSA. 

 Put an extra $100/mo in a 3X S&P500(UPRO) .  Wait up to 5 years to sell $2k-5k gains tax free( long term capital).  This protects your gains without a 15%-25% tax penalty.  Use the realized gain to buy more S&P500 (VOO) and keep it for a life. 

Investing 2.0 is used if you have extra income, want to support faster VOO growth, and can tax loss harvest. 

VOO 10% annualized returns is only meant as a hedge against 5% future inflation and small retirement. 


The underlining S&P500 index would need to lose 34% in one day to be instantly wiped out in UPRO. Highly unlikely with exchange safe guards and risk management.  UPRO is meant as a short term investing. 

No one is saying puting all money or sufficient amount in UPRO.  $100 or 10% is adequate risk and benefit for UPRO.  

Example #1. Investing 1.0. Put $100/mo in VOO for 30 years returns an  est. $228k.  After  inflation, adjusted purchasing power is $113k in 2051.

Example #2 Investing 2.0.

Whilst European EV sales explode to presently 19% of all car sales this year, Tesla does not even make the top five EV sellers by company at a lowly 7%. (VW 25%; Stellantis 13%; Daimler 10%; BMW 10%; Hyundia-Kia 9%).

Tesla, unlike in the US, is simply being outsold by the vast array of alternative BEV models on sale particularly.  VW group alone offers the e-up, ID3 and ID4 (ID5 not yet on sale); Audi e-tron, e-tron Sportback e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT; Cupra Born; and Skoda Enyaq

In China Tesla has been pushed into 3rd place this year by BYD which has seen EV sales grow from 53K Q1; 98K.Q2; 183K Q3.  Tesla meanwhile has seen China quarterly sales for 2021 flattish at 69K, 62K and 75K.  China will likely sell 3 million EV's this year, half the worlds volume and Tesla sales are flat for the year.  Tesla might sell a lowly 9%.

Tesla dominates the US markets of course, where few EV models are on sale.  EV sales might be 3% of automotive sales.

Whilst investors will assert these stats do not.matter and Tesla's valuation is all about  tech, batteries and robo-taxis, it still does not sell any car related tech beyond its own cars.  Take up of FSD is a lowly 11%.  It still buys it's battery cells.  By its own statements it has a level 2/3 driver assist whilst companies like Waymo are already starting to offer level 4/5 robo-taxis in cities like San Fran (a free trial program has commenced).

With Tesla slipping badly in the two biggest and mature EV markets globally, it's EV mkt share has fallen from near 18% highs in 2019 to 14.7% YTD in 2021.  With Europe and China likely to see 20% EV sales, the Tesla domination of global car mkts story is looking utterly flawed, yet its market capitalisation is now than the entire companies combined that sell 99% of cars and are adding EV's faster.

Tesla is frankly trading at utterly ludicrous levels given the clear reality of global EV market growth.",2036,True,1636029919.0,2021-11-04 13:45:19,11480,2304,Historical_Job_8609,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qmjr7o/tesla_sells_1_of_cars_globally_yet_is_priced_more/,True,0.84,2021,tesla,top,False,False,0,

post,qtyl1f,,"Elon Musk and whoever are his financial advisers are, believe his stock is overvalued.","When the CEO himself is giving signs that they think their stock is overpriced, I think it's time to start taking note. If anyone has a sense on when the irrationality will end, it's probably him and his advisors.

This whole thing about Elon trying to cash out some stock to pay taxes as a nice guy, was an obvious BS excuse. Then the media comes out saying his REAL intention is to pay taxes that are due. Brilliant, double play to cover for his personal cash out. 

If Elon had faith that his stock still had room to grow, there is no chance in hell he'd be selling. He'd just be getting a loan to cover his tax liabilities, while his equity value increases. The fact that he's trying to cash out shows he thinks it's near peak and about to go down. All the media drama is just an attempt to retain value for as long as possible to distract and justify his cash out. 

It's crazy how I see NO ONE talking about this... And instead it's all about ""clever redditors"" seeing his real intentions are to cover his tax liability. No it's not.

post,r0m3yh,,I regret buying a Tesla and I haven't driven a single mile yet.,"This isn't a post about charging or the lack of physical buttons. 

This is a post about a complete lack of customer service. 

I preordered a Model 3 LR three months ago. I was given a delivery window of Mid November to mid December. I got a message last week saying it was my turn to pick up my car. Sweet. They give me a choice of three days on their website to pick up the car. November 24, 25, 26. I find it a bit odd that thanksgiving they are open but I'm working on the 24th and the 26th and on such short notice I can't get out of work. So I put down delivery for the 25th. After all other stores are open on thanksgiving and the site blacked out other dates. 

I get messages from Tesla that I need to get my car insurance and pay the down payment or I won't be able to get the car. No problem. 

I pay the down payment via their app and get the insurance. I upload the proof to their app. All good. 

Then yesterday on 11/22/2021 I get a phone call at 3 pm saying that I can no longer pick up the car on 11/25 because they aren't actually open. 

Uh ok. So you tell me this after I put down the down payment and pay for the insurance. I'm a little pissed at this point but I get it. Let me pick it up another day then. And why didn't you tell me sooner?

They would only let me pick the 24th or 26th. That's it. I asked them can I pick up the car on December 2nd because I have work and can't reschedule or get someone to cover me on such short notice. Their response is ""no, we can't hold the car that long. We will give your car to someone else and you can wait another 3-4 weeks for another car to come in.""

The heck? They made the mistake. Took my money. Made me buy insurance for a car that I don't actually have and then they try to bully me into a specific delivery date on short notice? That's not fair. 

To make matters worse I try to post my story to r/teslamotors and it gets automatically deleted.

post,rxqpdy,,How long can a Tesla survive stranded on a freeway in the winter? I did the math to find out.,"After reading the Washington Post article about electric cars being unsuitable when stranded on a freeway in the winter, I decided to do an experiment to find out the truth.

**The Scenario**

* My Model X was fully preconditioned prior to the start of the test
* The battery was charged to 80% prior to the start of the test
* Temperatures here in Michigan today were very uniform.  20 degrees all day.
* After preconditioning, the Model X was parked in my driveway for the test period
* Seat heaters, and steering wheel heaters were activated.  
* Cabin temp set to 70 degrees.  HVAC on Auto mode.
* Camp Mode was started, and the car was left in the driveway for the test period
* Vehicle doors will remain closed during the test period.  Mobile App used to acquire data every hour.
* Test duration:  5 hours

**The Raw Data**

* 79% - 207 miles - 11:45am - **Test Start**
* 76% - 201 miles - 12:53pm
* 74% - 196 miles  - 1:46pm
* 69% - 181 miles - 3:48pm
* 67% - 175 miles - 4:45pm - **Test End**

**The Results**

* Model X used an average of 2.4% of battery per hour throughout the test period
* Range went from 207 miles, to 175 miles at the end of the test.
* 5 hours of Camp mode utilized…
   * 32 miles of range
   * 12 % of range
* 24 hours of Camp Mode would require (extrapolated)…
   * 153 miles of range
   * 58% of range

This data conclusively proves that a Model X can easily keep all passengers in complete comfort during a 24 hour duration event while stranded on the freeway in the winter, using less than half of the maximum battery capacity.  All the while, the passengers have access to Netflix, video games, and plenty of online entertainment.

&#x200B;

Next step - I might re-run this same test tomorrow with my Model S.

Elon holds a scholarly competition for hyperloop. The Boring tunnels are not hyperloop... ffs. They aren't even operating yet, technically. The tunnels are there though. Might as well let them get some use as they continue to build out infrastructure and develop the autonomous system. Until that's finished it's just a small tunnel. Nothing special except for the machine that made it. 
Tunnels are definitely useful. We have them in plenty of places and they also can get traffic and have issues but are of net gain. The advantage of Boring Co. being that electric vehicles require less ventilation in the tunnels and autonomous vehicles require less space.
So the tunnels become cheaper than a single lane addition to any city street, which is impossible in most places, no room. Plenty of room underground. If you can get the cost of the tunnels low enough, you can keep adding lanes, near indefinitely, as far as population density is concerned.

Autonomous vehicles will be here sooner than later and it will take 15-20 years going gangbusters to get enough of these tunnels put in. Stop trying to slow them down. We need these. BEFORE autonomous vehicles are available.

Neon is used in lithography to make microchips.

I mean, not really. Delaware Chancery Court is going to force him to go through with the sale at the $54.20 price specifically for all of the reasons you just said. Elon has *every financial incentive* not to do what he's doing, but he's got an addictive personality and, right now, he's addicted to shitposting.

He's going to instantly lose billions of dollars by spending $44B on a company that's worth, at most, about $20–30B. Not only that, but as his debt financing expires, he may be compelled to sell huge quantities of TSLA shares at a significant discount just to complete the purchase. 

On top of the billions he's going to lose in the sale, the SEC is also likely to fine him a giant amount of money or ban him from serving as an officer of any publicly traded company.

Elon's sitting comfortably in the ""fuck around"" phase right now, but the ""find out"" phase is coming. He can save face by following through on the $54.20 deal without forcing it through court.

comment,v1itrt,v1itrt,,"I’m the opposite of a Tesla fanboy, but what large NYSE listed car manufacturers aren’t down significantly? Ford is down 50%, GM 40%, and even Toyota and Ferrari have been down close to 30%.

Tesla gets the headlines because of its overall valuation, but on percentage terms, it’s only down marginally higher than other large car stocks.

Having said that, investors priced Tesla at its peak like it’s the Apple of car stocks. The car industry is vastly different, and I’m of the opinion that the new Toyota EV (the Toyota BZ4X) is going to fly off the shelves. Not because it’s the best EV or has the best performance figures, but because Toyota has some of the most loyal customers in the world. It’s perceived as the most reliable and trustworthy brand, and it’s why the Corolla and RAV4 are the two highest selling cars by volume in the world. The Corolla isn’t the best car in its class, but everyone that buys it knows what they’re getting (reliability, ease of use, build quality, resale value, good capped priced servicing etc).

Tesla don’t even make the best EV in the world. The best EV according to various 2021 car of the year awards is the Kia EV6. 

The interesting aspect to Tesla that I’m waiting to see play out is the polarising views of Musk himself.

I think that in a different economic and political environment, Musk would have had been called out on a lot more things up until now, especially everything to do with automated driving and product rollouts. Like if tech wasn't hyped up with move fast and break things mantra being common, Tesla would have been stopped by the NHTSA from releasing the feature publicly as a beta.

post,y4xdxo,,"I am kind of ashamed of owning a Tesla, which makes me sad.","First, just the sheer fact that I do not want to post this in a Tesla sub as to avoid backlash is representative of how I feel. Criticism is typically shunned by the Tesla fanboys, even if it is justified and unbiased. 

Second, I went with a Tesla because the technology was way above (IMO) the rest. Very much best in class, even though I feel like the outer design is a little too “different” for my taste. I’ve really enjoyed driving it. But the gap is quickly closing, and some of the design decisions and manufacturing makes me scratch my head.

The “ashamed” part, however, stems from the leader of the organization. He has become so polarizing that I can’t even have a conversation with people I meet regarding my Tesla without his name coming up. It makes me feel like people are looking at me as if I share his views because I own one. I wish he would just fade into obscurity with his billions and call it a win. I cannot wait for something to pop up (maybe the Rivian R1S) that grabs my interest the way Tesla initially did.

post,151kpky,,I’ll never doubt Tesla’s navigation again,Driving from San Diego to Phoenix. The navigation routed me off the interstate and through the mountains saying I’d arrive at the next charger with 10%. Once I hit the point of no return I started realizing that there was no way I could possibly make it with enough battery to the charger. I was down to 3% with nearly 30 miles to go but it was still saying I was going to make it with 10%. Panic set in. AC and music off. Windows down. Wife getting our AAA info ready to have to call a tow truck. We were in the middle of nowhere with nowhere to even pull over off the road. Just as I was about to give up a road sign said “watch for braking downhill next 20 miles” next thing I know regenerative braking had my percentage slowly climbing. I climbed 8% during the downhill portion of the drive and made it with 10% just as it said I would. Tesla is a truly incredible machine.

20 miles south of Blanding there's a restaurant with some Level 2 chargers but that is it until Gallup.

The headwinds were fierce that day. ABRP Pro was picking up on that. The Tesla NAV not so much apparently. 

By the time I got to the restaurants, the arrival charge had dropped from 30 to 20%.

I added 5% more at the restaurant and arrived in Gallup with 10% just about where ABRP predicted and 20% less than the NAV predicted.

Tesla NAV has gotten better over time but it still routinely lowers it's estimated arrival SOC by 10% while you are in the middle of a drive.

The seats on our X are incredibly good and supportive.  I regularly drive 6.5 hours to go visit my sister and we arrive feeling fresh.  Teslas are ridiculously and exceedingly good for road trips for a number of reasons: a lot of the toll on driving is related to stress (which is greatly reduced when the car handles a lot of the tasks for you) and being forced to stop every few hours for a quick charge is actually a great way to allow the occupants to stretch out, relax, etc.  I used to get much more tired driving 5.5 hours on our ICE vehicle, than 6.5 on the X.

2. Wind.  Head winds... especially at 30/40 + in the new mexico / arizona area.  ouch.
3. Cold.  In the north areas, even in the central areas in the Winter, especially at night, noticeable hits.  (granted, ours doesn't have the heat pump...)
4. Combinations of the stuff above.

post,194ajsm,,My Tesla with a drivable 2000 to 4000 solar array,"I've been a long time reader, but not poster. For the last two years I've been working on a 2000 watt to 4000 watt solar system for my Model Y -- Today I can charge anywhere in the world!

I can reliably get 20 miles to 60 miles per day. I can expand these solar panels with ease, and contract them when I want to start driving.

I've also decided to put all the 3D printed parts required to build this online at [dartsolar.com](https://dartsolar.com) \-- if you want me to build you one, or if you want to get the free 3D parts and the blueprints for this build enter your email in the green box on the link.

The reason I can pack so many solar panels is because I am using telescoping carbon fiber tubes as my mechanism of expansion and contraction, as opposed to mechanical sliders. This allows me to pack 4000 watts of solar on a Tesla, without going over the max roof weight capacity of 165 lbs.

Overall it has been a fun project so far and I am designing Beta2. Beta1 is 11 inches high and is made out of wood. Beta2 will be fully made of carbon fiber and will be 6 inches high. Right now I researching the DC-to-DC charging and hot wiring.

Thank you all for your inspiration by sharing and discussing all things Tesla, **and of course ask me anything in the comments** and I'll reply shortly.

This is my first time renting a Tesla. I had the car for about 7 days and only driven the car for 561 miles and charged it at max 6 times at a supercharging station provided by Tesla.

I have contacted Hertz and they said the charges are correct and the bill comes directly from the Tesla super charging station. I argued this over the phone and nothing. I have called Tesla and asked what could this charge be and they told me even if you sit the car for nearly 2 hours the charge wouldn’t be that high which we never did during this trip.

post,1b5o2uy,,Tesla hate is real,"After driving ICE cars that belonged to my parents or relying on public transport for the past years I decided after finishing my studies and getting a job I decided to buy my first own car. After taking into account costs + fun drive + luxury I decided an electric car would be the right option. Settled for a Tesla Model Y and am super happy. 
I obviously told my friends and family and damn  never expected such a negative reaction. 

I know there was a negative stigma around them but  literally from work, friends and family everybody was just criticizing my decision.
Instead of being happy for me or at least only mildly cricising due not having an electric car before I got comments like what a bad decision, never would buy electric, car will be worth 0 in 3 years, laughing about it being stupid, never able to take a long trip, charging on roadrips for hours with no range, etc. 

I couldn’t even argue with them and present my facts everybody just straight up was condescending and didn’t change their opinion. Yesterday another friend found out and said: „A Tesla/electric car driver will not be allowed to step into my car“ lol

Did you experience similar hate too? Really interesting that from my whole environment young or old has still such a big hate for Teslas or electric cars which I just dont understand like you dont have to like them but why hate so much when it doesn’t affect you…

Only real difference is that the outer ""rain slick"", or whatever you want to call it, appears to be darker in the customer images, and ""looser"", but that might be attributed to the fact that they put it together in the rain and don't have it all secured and such.

I feel like people are judging based off of the *concept* drawing, and not what's actually being sold through the website...

The Caliber study relates specifically to corporate reputation, where Tesla dropped by almost 30 pts in its “Trust & Like” and “Consideration” indexes over the last two years, which measure peoples’ opinion of a brand and if they’d consider buying their product.

They don’t appear to draw a direct line to Musk’s behavior, unclear if there’s a question in their survey directly about that, but it would be a pretty strange thing to have asked *before* Musk started having a higher profile and revealed his controversial political alignment. I also seriously doubt they’d have questions about any other auto executives — could you even name the president of Honda America?

Instead Caliber threads the needle by pointing out their survey does show that 83% of adults know who Musk is and that he runs Tesla.

Not an entirely unreasonable conclusion to jump to, but I’d still rate this a bad use of data.

Personally I would not consider a Tesla because I think they’re generally very good computers wrapped in a very mediocre car.

It shocks me how negative the tone is here about FSD. I live in Los Angeles where city driving can be hectic and the latest FSD v12 is a game changer.

It makes the right decisions (and drives better than I do) 99% of the time. The 1% of the time it makes the wrong decisions are usually very obvious beforehand and it's easy for me to disengage, quickly make the right decision, and fire FSD right back up.

I use it almost exclusively for every drive now and will never drive another car that doesn't offer it. Even despite monitoring the road the entire time, I am no longer making thousands of brain-fatiguing micro decisions every time I'm in the driver's seat and driving is such a pleasure.

comment,1ctjrpu,1ctjrpu,,"A few thoughts from an actual user:

  
It had a few hiccups, but it was a LOT better than I thought it would be. The few times I had to intervene were mostly because I wasn't comfortable with the situation. For example, I didn't like that it didn't seem to pay attention to semi's blind spots, and would just cruise right beside them. My longest trips was 140 miles on a not-so-busy highway and it was nearly perfect. I didn't intervene one time.

For the amount of miles my wife drives, $99 is too much for me. However, if I was going on a long road trip and planned on using a lot in a month, I would pay $99. I think for our amount of usage, $30 would be about right.

  
Everyone I know that tried it a lot, was really impressed. There were a few things that people complained about like accelerating fast at lights, which is more of a preference thing, which I actually enjoyed.

It made me hate AutoPilot even more. There is zero reason that I shouldn't be able to switch lanes without interrupting the cruise control.

I used FSD and the trial reaffirmed that I will never pay for FSD unless it's $2,000 or less. To me FSD still drives too slow and skittish especially at irregular stop signs or intersections. Also city / back roads the constant changing of speed limits puts you back to the speed limit, if I'm not doing 10mph over on the city streets I'll have traffic piling up my ass behind me. Also when the speed limit goes from 35 to 45mph, most human drivers are doing 50-55mph by the time you hit the 45mph sign, so people would ride up my ass and I'd manually have to speed up early.

comment,1d9r0xw,1d9r0xw,,"It’s critical to have your chief officer at a public company be reliable, stable, and a clear communicator. Elon is none of these things. He’s a liability to the brand at this point because he can’t keep his focus on Tesla consistently. 

He needs to accept that it’s okay to be a startup tycoon and not a lifelong CEO of everything he starts. It’s simply not possible to do well when you spread yourself so thin while running your mouth with incredibly unpopular opinions. Then the guy acts shocked that people don’t like him, and consequently, his brands. He makes emotional decisions that are just stupid, frankly. He then wakes up with a hangover of regret and his supposed delegates have to constantly cover his ass.

Some ideas based on customer feedback 

DMV Test Mode- DMVs around the country are failing young drivers primary due to our exceptional one pedal driving. You could piggy back the brake burnish command with a different UI.  This would force the driver to use the pedal and then the instructors would have less to grip about. 

Drivers Ed Mode- create a program that teaches young drivers the rules of the road through a series of challenges.  In this mode the vehicle will set up routes based on the users progress through the training these routes would become more advanced. Make it into a “simulator” of sorts and they could even practice the basics while parked.  

So folks, let’s have it.  I’m still held to some NDAs but my experiences are mine.  I’ll still gladly help you when and where I can.

post,1eimxw9,,"I tracked the price of 3000 used Teslas, here is what I found","I tracked the price of used cars listed on the Tesla website for the last 4 months. In total, I tracked \~3000 cars. I focused on cars listed in the San Francisco Bay Area. I used a linear regression model to determine what factors influence the price.

**Some insights:**

* Model Y and Model 3 cars are listed for 5 days on average before being removed/sold. Model X and S take a little longer, with an average of 7 days.
* Tesla automatically lowers the price if a car does not sell. On average the price decreased by $200 per day.
* 68% of all cars have basic Autopilot, 29% have FSD, 3% come with Enhanced Autopilot.
* 99% of eligible used cars include the Acceleration Boost option.

***Pricing factor estimates by model:***

**Model 3**

*Price reducing factors*

* $97 per 1000 miles driven
* $127 for each extra month in age
* $860 when previously repaired

*Model variants:*

* $3500 for Long range ($9000 new)
* $2300 performance version (new $7000)

*Premium options:*

* $1400 for EAP
* $2600 for FSD (new $8000)
* $90 for the white interior (new $1000)

Black ($221) and gray ($150) have a better resale value, compared to red (-$142), white (-$93) and blue (-$56).

No difference was found between 18 and 19 inch wheels ($1000 new)

**Model Y**

*Price reducing factors*

* $133 per 1000 miles driven
* $239 for each extra month in age
* $1600 when previously repaired

*Model variants:*

* $5500 for AWD ($3000 new)
* $3100 performance version (new $7000)

*Premium options:*

* $1900 for EAP
* $2800 for FSD (new $8000)
* $120 for the white interior (new $1000)

Red ($341) and black ($199) have a better resale value, compared to gray (-$121), white (-$113) and blue (-$306).",2559,True,1722637034.0,2024-08-03 00:17:14,5647,385,tbyd683,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1eimxw9/i_tracked_the_price_of_3000_used_teslas_here_is/,True,0.96,2024,tesla,top,False,False,0,

post,1f7a9i7,,Stranger blown away by FSD,"So I was activating a charger in a strip mall parking lot when a gentleman approached and started asking the usual EV questions.  ""Is it free to charge, how far does it go, how many chargers are there"". Years ago, these interactions were somewhat common, but as more and more people know about EVs,  it's not anymore. So it was a pleasant surprise, and I happily answered. 

Then he asked 'is this one of those self driving ones?'.

'yep, drove me here'

'no... It didn't actually?'

'yep' ... The look on his face was pessimistic so... 'if you have a few moments, hop on and see for yourself'. 12.3.6 is good, but it certainly has issues, but whatever, let's see what this random guy thinks...

He excitedly agrees, and we get in and I enter a random waypoint and let FSD pull out of the parking stall and off we go. I proactively mentioned it can be a bit silly in parking lots, and it certainly was very slow and cautious... But the guy was too blown away to care. As FSD turned onto public roads, and as it navigated the world around it, the amazement in this guy's eyes and voice grew by the moment. 

It was maybe a 10 minute drive, in mostly residential roads, but it was perfect. I didn't have to intervene once. Stops, yields, pedestrians and bikes, a car blocking the path while it turned around, fitting through narrow gaps due to parked cars and an oncoming big truck, slowing for speed bumps... And when it returned us to the parking lot, I selected a parking stall and it parked itself. 

The guy was losing his mind. He couldn't believe the car just drove him around. He was so awe-struck, so excited. He thanked me and then noticed his buddy, who was waiting for him... As he walked off with his friend, this 30ish year old guy was talking about his experience like a giddy school boy.

Sometimes it's nice to get an outsiders perspective on FSD. Sure, it wasn't the hardest route, but it was a random, real world route... And to this guy, it was magical.",2118,True,1725292645.0,2024-09-02 17:57:25,873,159,footbag,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1f7a9i7/stranger_blown_away_by_fsd/,True,0.93,2024,tesla,top,False,False,0,

We talk for a few minutes as I wait for my next ride request. His wife comes walking out and the guy excitedly recounts his FSD experience. He offered me $100 cash if I could take them for a spin around the corner quick so the wife could experience it.

post,1frg26x,,Rented a Model 3. I get why rental companies are dumping Teslas.,"Preface: I own a Model Y and I love it. Best car I've ever owned.

Had to go to Albuquerque for a short 2-day business trip. Rented a compact car from Budget. Guy asked how far I'd be driving, I said almost none, staying in airport area. He asked if he can give me a Tesla, I said sure. He told me it was a Y, but it was actually a RWD 3 with the LFP pack.

After getting in the car, ALL the settings were jacked up. Screen on Light rather than auto, headlights on rather than auto, climate manual not auto. Random safety features turned off. Autopilot set to TACC-only (although I get that). Sentry on. Bunch of other ones I forget, but I had to fix almost every setting. Luckily battery was at 98% so thats good. Unlike Hertz, Budget does not allow app connectivity, just the card.

I drove away and attended a meeting for a few hours. Came back out to the A/C humming away, I had missed the cabin overheat protection setting, it drained 10% of the battery in the hot New Mexico sun. Luckily I only used 20% of the battery my whole trip because I stayed pretty local. Car was also sort of janky: really bad wind noise/gap in driver window somewhere, and suspension felt a little rattle-y compared to my Y. Car had 21k miles. However I was impressed with the power of the RWD model. It's totally adequate, if not impressive.

Anyway, the ONLY reason I was able to navigate all this is because I own a Tesla and I know all this stuff. I cannot imagine any non-Telsa-owner being able to figure all this out and being happy with the experience. And I didn't even have to figure out how/where to charge it, that would be a whole other ball of wax for a new person. Beyond depreciation, I bet they've gotten tons of user complaints on these.

No problems. Had a couple of recall fixes, and one of the fixes they messed up the trunk seal which then leaked and needed to be repaired.

comment,1g7hhm8,1g7hhm8,,"I think it’s really easy for nuance and details to get lost over text, which is part of why I don’t like everything being handled through the app. There’s a convenience factor for sure, but being there in person with a service advisor (ideally the same one each time) who can physically see the issue and keep track of things is a much better approach for situations like OP’s. 

Tesla’s advisors, from what I can tell, work from a queue and it’s often not the same person you’re interacting with from message to message or day to day (mainly in the app). I also imagine they have time-to-response metrics they’re held to in some way, so it’s super easy for context to get lost when you’re unfamiliar with the situation and jump into the message thread without reading all of the past service history and notes. 

It’s pretty inexcusable for a company of Tesla’s size to handle things this way, especially when dealing with more complex situations. It’s one thing to handle a simple tire rotation like this, but when dealing with a (fairly) complex warranty issue, there are just too opportunities for details to get lost over text. 

I’d agree that showing up in person is the way to go. I’ve always had good experiences with Tesla’s service advisors in person; so if OP has one near by, showing up in person and calmly explaining the situation would be the best place to start. 

I’d avoid mentioning a lawyer to anyone.

post,1gs3w77,,My Tesla with an expanding solar roof -- generates 4.5kwh per day,"Hello Reddit, this is an update of the last year worth of work on a personal project of mine -- placing an expandable solar array on my Tesla. And like all the past builds, the blueprints will be online for anyone to access. The last prototype Beta2 had lots of great feedback, and I am excited to share RC1 (Release Candidate 1). Officially the community is called [DartSolar](https://dartsolar.com) now, if you search online you can find our Reddit post from last year and all our blueprints.

https://preview.redd.it/wmzwpush541e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=08c6381084c14dc179fdd4d80426618f37c37d78

https://i.redd.it/ctxmyr9m341e1.gif

This is a 1kw solar array, composed of 6 smaller custom solar panels. These smaller solar panels are more serviceable, easier to replace, and makes it cheaper to fix. The roof rack uses custom made telescopic tubes make of aluminum (mostly), and some one segment made of stainless steel that I'm planning to replace with carbon fiber. However, when I release the blueprints I'll have the aluminum and carbon fiber specifications. You can get the blueprints of Beta2, and get these blueprints [here](https://dartsolar.com).

https://i.redd.it/aua77z4g441e1.gif

The entire design had to be aerodynamic af. I wanted no more than 2% aerodynamic drag loss. So I tested different designs on a 10-mile stretch where I would drive with the DartSolar on and off. The current model is about 1-inch tall, we created a custom made roof rack support to further decrease the height. Because the whole thing is flat we've observed 1% drag loss when driving at 30 mph, and about 2% when driving at 60 mph. In my daily commute I rarely go over 60 mph.

https://i.redd.it/77di9blfx31e1.gif

The solar panels are locked when driving by magnetic locks. That way they are very easy to open, but also the panels will not open when you're driving.

1. The front and sides of the panels are flat/rectangular. Can you reduce drag by making them rounded/more triangular? Kind of like a spoiler. 
2. Could you reduce drag by rubberizing the under service of the panels directly over the roof and designing the rack so that the panels can be dropped flush to the roof when driving?
3. Would you consider an option where the panels can be plugged directly into the TESLA when charging? I don’t like the idea of driving around with a giant battery in my trunk.

comment,1hpsc0u,1hpsc0u,,"Plutocrats like Elon Musk (not a U.S. Service Veteran) want cheap labor they can exploit. Contrary to the ""DOGE"" narrative, the fact is there is currently an oversupply of high-quality domestic tech labor as the U.S. has experienced [major technology layoffs in 2024](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/tech-news/the-state-of-tech-layoffs-in-2024-a-closer-look-at-major-cuts-and-industry-trends#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20the%20tech%20industry%20will%20undergo%20massive,these%20cuts%2C%20as%20are%20hundreds%20of%20smaller%20startups.).

The H-1B visa gives an employer complete control over the employee. If the employee loses the job, they lose their visa and are sent back to their home country. This is why the plutocrats want the H-1B visas. In the program employees can be coerced into working 100-hour weeks for below average pay.

Tellingly, Elon Musk runs Tesla as a nonunion shop in the United States. Musk also has ongoing well-publicized disputes with the unions in Germany and Sweden. Musk's just a less interesting version of the 19th century robber barons who hired Pinkertons to fire upon the rank-and-file.

comment,1hq6gib,1hq6gib,,"There's a few factors at play here.

1) the median age of vehicles on the road in the US is over 12 years. Half of then are therefore pretty close to several decades old and in various states of repair.

2) accident rate increases with the age of the vehicle. Older vehicles are therefore over-represented in calls for service by first responders.

3) Older vehicles on average are less safe before you even factor in any age related degradation.


The result is something of a bias that doesn't necessarily reflect the reality of cars built in the last few years. The Model Y has a very strong roof structure. Ioniq 5's roof strength tested within 5% of the Y. Both are demonstrably very safe vehicles.

There is an impact of vehicle geometry to consider though as well. Ioniq 5 has a much closer to vertical rear gate/window which may have resulted in more of a rear collision rather than one that skidded up the Y and landed on the roof. That could be no big deal or it could be worse. There's not really a way for us to know. Oddly enough IIHS does not do any rear impact testing.

Tldr; Modern cars, especially EVs, are all quite safe. Different cars behave differently though so there's no way to really know which is better for a specific accident.",1255,False,1735653908.0,2024-12-31 15:05:08,13,0,zackplanet42,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1hq6gib/the_glass_roof_is_no_joke_a_truck_rear_ended_a/m4oy7xs/,True,,2024,tesla,top,False,False,0,m4oy7xs

I want to support a ceo and company who isn’t a Nazi.  I decided not to buy a new Tesla a few years ago because of his behavior.  Now I wouldn’t ever buy even a used one.  I will not be caught dead in a Tesla and its Nazi owner.  His behavior is disgusting and his hatred of minorities is on par with some of the worst in history.  He has been sued by black ppl for racism at his company many times.  Sexually assaulting and harassing countless women who work for him. Doing a Nazi salute.  This goes on and on.  

Now that he’s trying to buy off American politics it’s on us to topple his riches and his companies.  

Do not buy a Tesla.  Used or not.  Do not use his super chargers.

What do you think it takes to get a fab running? A couple years, concrete, some low skill workers, and the requisite machines manufactured by ASML in the Netherlands? You would be thoroughly wrong if you said yes to that second question. First, just designing the building needs to take into account the need for near perfect operating conditions for the clean rooms and the other various environments necessary to produce chips from silicon wafers. If expedited, this could destroy entire batches of chips due to mild changes in weather or seismic activity, if not bring down the entire facility for an extended period of time. So that work needs to be perfect. You will note a running theme here that every single aspect of these facilities need to be effectively perfect for them to work. They are producing incredibly complex structures on the order of NANOMETERS. That requires unfathomable precision, which in turn requires eternally, completely stable operating conditions. Taking into account American sign-off processes from a bureaucratic standpoint, and the fact that American construction routinely cuts corners, TSMC would need to constantly oversee their entire building process and additionally lube the gears of the federal and local government to make this process work.",4501,True,1738073186.0,2025-01-28 15:06:26,28,0,homelessness_is_evil,investing,https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ic0kp2/trump_announces_chip_tariffs_up_to_100/m9my7gb/,True,,2025,tesla,top,False,False,0,m9my7gb

post,1ie1jty,,Finally did it. Out with the Tesla.,"
Hey Everyone,

I have been a Tesla model y driver the last three years. My lease was up and due to recent developments with Elon and the staleness of having a Tesla (including a model 3 before) for the last 5 years; it was time for a change. 

Last night I made the jump and signed a lease of a 2024 Equinox EV 2RS all black. My lease isn’t up for a month and I just went to look and test drive anyway. I drove it and was blown away. It feels remarkably similar to my Dual Motor model Y but the interior quality was better. Loved every bit of it. It even has super cruise. The only option it’s lacking that I wish it had is the panoramic sunroof. 

I feel like I got a great deal (I negotiated pretty hard). 24 month lease with $315 per month lease with $0 down, 10,000 miles. All in all, spending $120 less per month than my Tesla. Very happy!

post,1ifna8h,,Canada will retaliate with 25% tariffs on US imports and limit export of rare minerals as response to Trump tariffs! Trade war is on!,"Canada is imposing it’s own 25 per cent tariffs on $155 billion worth of U.S. goods after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped Canada with 25 per cent tariffs on all goods and 10 per cent tariffs on oil, natural gas and electricity.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the tariffs will take effect on $30 billion worth of goods starting Tuesday with a further $125 billion worth of products being taxed 21 days later.

Trudeau elected to go ahead with retaliatory tariffs even though Trump’s order includes a mechanism to escalate the rates if Canada retaliates against the U.S.

Canada will also look at how to limit export of rare minerals to the US which are crucial for US tech and car companies like Tesla.

comment,1j0ee91,1j0ee91,,"From the article: This issue arises because the Cybertruck’s powerful single wiper doesn’t always spray enough windshield wiper fluid to break down all the salt kicked up by other vehicles. At highway speeds, salt accumulates rapidly, and it’s even possible for the Cybertruck’s forward camera cluster to get blocked, which may trigger a request for the driver to take over.

The solution to this issue is simple: apply more fluid to the windshield to help break up the salt, which the Giga wiper can then wipe away. Currently, washer fluid is only sprayed during downstrokes, and holding down the wiper button just repeats the cycle. However, according to a post on X by Wes Morril, Cybertruck’s Lead Engineer, that’s about to change.

With the upcoming software update 2025.2.8, which is expected to roll out to Cybertruck owners in the next few days, Tesla has introduced a new feature for the washer button. Now, holding down the button for two full cycles (two sweeps of the wiper) will continuously soak the windshield. This means you’ll be able to apply double the amount of fluid — on upward and downward wiper strokes.

This is a highly requested improvement, particularly from Cybertruck owners in regions where road salt is frequently used during winter. While the winter season is nearing its end in much of North America, this update will be a welcomed improvement for next year’s colder months.",1408,False,1740766742.0,2025-02-28 19:19:02,39,0,chrisdh79,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1j0ee91/tesla_improves_the_cybertruck_wiper_in_software/mfaix2e/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mfaix2e

It is dead silent in the cabin, solid, the B&W sound system is ridiculous (and I thought the MY was the best I’d ever had in a car). The adjustable air suspension and real torque vectoring make it handle beautifully. Fit and finish is better. 

Polestar is based in, designed, and engineered Sweden with obvious sharing with Volvo. Geely is their largest investor but from my understanding it is not involved in the day to day operations. They own Lotus as well. The car is built in South Carolina.

comment,1j5z8gn,1j5z8gn,,"More than 200 auto dealers across the country were “stiffed” when Tesla “had a run on the bank,” claiming tens of millions of dollars in EV rebates on the last weekend before the government abruptly shut down the public subsidy program in January.

Now these independently owned dealerships are out of pocket an estimated $10 million, having provided 2,295 rebates to customers and expecting to get reimbursed, according to the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association (CADA).

“These dealers in good faith gave customers the money for a program that is always refunded,” said CADA spokesperson Huw Williams. “They shouldn’t be left making a payment on behalf of the Government of Canada.”

The iZEV EV rebate program offered from $2,500 to $5,000 toward the purchase of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. Dealerships provided the rebate to buyers upfront and expected to be reimbursed by the government.

On Jan. 10, as political turmoil embroiled the federal government, Transport Canada informed dealerships that the EV rebate program would run out of money before its scheduled end in March.

“Due to the high uptake, the iZEV Program will be paused in a few weeks,” stated the email sent to dealerships just before noon on the Friday, obtained by the Star.

But that weekend there was an unprecedented surge in claims from four Tesla outlets, the Star revealed this week. The four Tesla showrooms claimed 8,653 EV sales in 72 hours and filed for $43.",3552,True,1741383519.0,2025-03-07 22:38:39,549,0,FourteenthCylon,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j5z8gn/suspicious_tesla_sales_surge_triggers_canadian/mgkxj49/,True,,2025,both,top,False,False,0,mgkxj49
comment,1j5z8gn,1j5z8gn,,"CADA surveyed its 3,500 dealer members to determine how many rebated EVs were sold that didn’t get inputted into the system before the federal government shut it down. Their numbers, which have not been made public, show 226 dealerships provided rebates on 2,295 electric vehicles and have not been reimbursed. This would total more than $10 million, if the breakdown of battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles mirrored all the rebates given out since 2019. 

Williams said one dealership is out of pocket $690,000. The Star spoke with two dealers in Quebec; both pointed out that most Quebec auto dealers are closed on the weekend and therefore were not only unable to sell EVs during the last weekend the rebate program was open, but also weren’t able to file paperwork when they returned to work on the Monday. One of the dealers said he was out $300,000. The other said he had fronted $410,000, and is considering layoffs because of the financial squeeze. 

Terry Budd, who owns eight car dealerships in the Oakville and Hamilton areas, said there was no notice from the government that the iZEV program was coming to an end. Instead, he received an email from CADA informing him the program was running short on funds and advising him to tell his salespeople and customers.

While they hurried to get as many rebates submitted as possible over the weekend, more than a month later, they still haven’t been paid for the 35 EVs and hybrids they sold that weekend.",1961,True,1741383539.0,2025-03-07 22:38:59,181,0,FourteenthCylon,stocks,https://reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j5z8gn/suspicious_tesla_sales_surge_triggers_canadian/mgkxlhe/,True,,2025,tesla,top,False,False,0,mgkxlhe

post,1j7l0bv,,TSLA being investigated by Transport Canada for cooking their books in Canada to snag EV rebates without selling cars.,"The article notes that **four Tesla dealerships claimed to have sold 8,653 Teslas in 3 days.** Assuming each dealership opens from 9AM-5PM, that's **90 cars sold per hour per dealership**. Worth noting that Canada's EV rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how Tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did...

Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M.

I guess that's one way to maintain revenue while sales drop 90%!

Note: investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation of official wrongdoing yet.

Edit: Since this post got more attention then I expected. Yes I posted this Sunday and TSLA is currently down 13% today. However I do not think this is causing the drop, and rather it’s an overall market pull back from trade wars and from Europe sales declines. The article was published Friday morning and Tesla was up 3% by end of Friday.

You know, normal stuff that poor nobodies with no connections get to do when they do an internship. 

So with a bunch of investors, Elon and three co-founders start X(dot)com. Within a few months, Elon fired one of the co-founders and the other two quit as a result. X(dot)com sucked so bad at banking that:

>In January 2000, it was discovered that a security flaw allowed users of X(dot)com who had the account number and bank routing number of any other bank account, even at other banks, could move money from that other account to their own and withdraw it. The problem existed for a month before it was discovered and corrected. 

And they had a competitor company that did know what they were doing, and was going to beat them, so guess what they did. Elon used his rich friends to just buy up the competitor.

comment,1j9jxzj,1j9jxzj,,"So there's two aspects to this:

The first is that all companies are run by people, and it's a completely natural and right that the people in charge of other EV companies would be horrified by Musk and his antics. The proper human response to nascent fascism is revulsion and opposition.

The second though is that companies get anthromorphized by consumers/audiences so that people see communications from that company (like ads and brand-managed social media posts) as coming from a *person*, rather than a company. People can have very personal responses to this - and interestingly, there is a large segment of the human population that is conflict-adverse over all else. Getting involved in a fight, *even if the cause is righteous* is seen as being ""just as bad"" as fighting for an evil cause. It is the *fight* that is wrong, irrespective of the root cause of the fight. 

So there is significant risk of alienating a large portion of your customer base with potential spillover to sales - and as the role of a company is always to make money, there is risk that standing up for what's right will see you punished financially.

This is the heart of ""Go woke, go broke"" (although that phrase is intended to be a threat; it isn't an axiom).

What is needed is a dose of moral courage in the boardrooms; a willingness to accept a (potential) short-term loss in revenue in favour of increased justice and morality.",1578,True,1741788262.0,2025-03-12 15:04:22,64,0,NorthStarZero,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1j9jxzj/kia_slams_elon_musk_in_brazen_new_ad/mhdx7a0/,True,,2025,elon,top,False,False,0,mhdx7a0

comment,1jb06ts,1jb06ts,,"From the article: British Columbia has announced that Tesla’s products—including its Powerwall home battery, inverters, and electric vehicle (EV) chargers—will no longer be eligible for rebates under the CleanBC and BC Hydro programs. The province claims this move is part of an effort to support Canadian-made products and reduce reliance on American imports.

However, the revised list of eligible products still includes American-made brands, raising questions about the policy’s consistency and the true motivation behind Tesla’s exclusion.

According to an update posted to the BC Hydro website, the exclusion of Tesla is meant to “preference Canadian goods” and “exclude, where practicable, U.S.-produced goods.” But a quick look at the updated list of eligible products reveals that almost all of the alternatives that remain eligible for rebates are U.S.-based.

In fact, of the companies still listed as eligible, only four are Canadian (FLO, Grizzl-E, Hypercharge, Sun Country Highway), while a whopping 73, or 94.8% of the companies on the list, are from the U.S., according to a review by Grok.

**“The Government of B.C. and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, U.S. produced goods.

Edit: I do expect the actual number to be very high, but I'd like to see that actual number. Beyond all the nazi-crap, Tesla just made the press in Germany by denying people  sick pay and even demanding sick pay refunds from employees.

Aside - Used bolts are crazy cheap! Kinda plasticy but for the 2 mile commute it works.

Ioniq 6 is super long! Bolt is not pulled in all the way else it would really show. Was able to get a 2023 with only 1700 miles which is crazy, but while the rated range is 270 vs 310 on the Y, in the 80 mile drive to the dealer and then back the Ioniq used less of the battery percentage. Some variability in the drives but at least a very close match.

comment,1jdbe40,1jdbe40,,"To preface. The last 5 years, I've owned 4 Teslas -- Model 3 SR+, M3 LR, MYP, MYP. I'll be brief, I believe they are good products and I made this decision because I believe it now stands for the wrong thing. Hope my Tesla goes to someone else instead of them buying new. Better to act on your convictions than to not act at all.

I considered the Ioniq 5, EV9, F150 Lightning, Polestar 3, Mach E, Mercedes EQS.

I was looking for something similar to Tesla. I mainly wanted the regen and software to be similar. And from a Tesla owners perspective, the Rivian is very similar, which is great! The regen is even stronger and adjustable.

Some of the other EVs DEFAULT to no regen or low regen. And they never remember your regen settings when you get in, you have to hit the paddles every time! I'm looking at you Kia and Hyundai!

I was not a fan of the software for the F150, Mach E or Mercedes. The layout of the Rivian infotainment is akin to modern tablet OS and has a native spotify app like Tesla. I can even google cast to it, which could arguably be easier than the native youtube app on Tesla. I can cast crunchyroll animes!

And to close this out. It's faster, SOFTER suspension, more versatile, and more luxurious inside.

The Tesla charging network is obviously a big plus for Tesla (although I can use my Rivian at most). The autopilot is also eons better in the Tesla and I'm actually surprised at how poor it is on my Rivian (my wife's Toyota's is actually better).

comment,1je8ms2,1je8ms2,,"“Tesla investors are having another rocky day, with shares down as much as 7%.

The stock is headed for an ninth-straight weekly loss, and now sits 53% below the all-time highs reached in mid-December.

As each day passes, the list of headwinds facing the EV maker seems to grow. In addition to existing pressures, Tesla on Tuesday faced fresh competition from China and an analyst price-target cut.

Below are four forces — two new, two evergreen — driving the acceleration in Tesla’s share-price decline.

1. BYD’s new battery tech

The Chinese firm BYD unveiled an EV-charging station that it claims can deliver up to 400 kilometers driving range after just five minutes of charging. This would be a big step up from current charging technology, with Tesla’s quickest version providing a 275-kilometer range after 15 minutes of charging.

The development creates another headwind for Tesla as it tries to break into Chinese market.

BYD plans to build 4,000 of these chargers across China.

2. Wall Street scaling back forecasts

Though RBC maintains an “outperform” rating on Tesla, it cut its price target to $320 from $440.

The analyst Tom Narayan expects lower pricing on Tesla’s full self-driving technology as autonomous offerings become increasingly standard across the EV industry. Meanwhile, given heightened competition in Europe and China, Narayan lowered robotaxi-penetration assumptions.",3126,True,1742315284.0,2025-03-18 17:28:04,86,0,TheWelshleyArms,business,https://reddit.com/r/business/comments/1je8ms2/4_reasons_why_teslas_53_stock_crash_is/migliis/,True,,2025,both,top,False,False,0,migliis

post,1jfkoj5,,I legit don't understand the Elon/Tesla hate.,"Hey guys,

I've been a fan of Elon for a very long time. I've read both biographies, watched easily \~80%+ of his interviews (there are a LOT out there now), and I resonate deeply with so much of how he thinks and what he does for the world.

That said, clearly, he's rubbed some people the wrong way.  
At the very least, there's a lot hatred being directed his way.

I'd love to explore this with people and help bridge what seems to be a growing divide.

I think the first step is by beginning to understand the people who do have hatred for Elon & Tesla, why that hatred is there?

I trust that more people than not genuinely want good things for the world, so I think we have that in common, and I'd like to build on that.

post,1jfn3wn,,Tesla (TSLA) accounting raises red flags as report shows $1.4 billion missing,"“Tesla’s (TSLA) accounting practices are raising red flags as a new report from the Financial Times shows that $1.4 billion is missing.
Many Tesla shorts and detractors have questioned Tesla’s accounting for years, but they have never gained much traction – until now.
Today, the Financial Times has released a new report pointing to a $1.4 billion gap in assets:

**Compare Tesla’s capital expenditure in the last six months of 2024 to its valuation of the assets that money was spent on, and $1.4bn appears to have gone astray**.”

post,1jfpxbt,,"Yes, arson against Tesla dealerships is considered an act of domestic terrorism.","Domestic terrorism in the US is defined under federal law in 18 U.S.C. § 2331(5) as activities that:

1. Involve acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law

2. Appear to be intended to:
   - Intimidate or coerce a civilian population
   - Influence government policy through intimidation or coercion
   - Affect government conduct through mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping

3. Occur primarily within US territorial jurisdiction

Given that:

1. The acts involve arson, which is dangerous to human life and violates federal/state law
2. The explicit political motivation to stop government activities makes it apparent that the acts are intended to influence government policy through intimidation or coercion
3. The targeting of Tesla dealerships across multiple locations suggests coordination and a deliberate strategy

All constitute acts of domestic terrorism, especially given the clear political motivation and the organizedf nature of the attacks across multiple locations.

The final straw? The Rose Garden shoot. A week later, as I sat at a red light, it hit me—I simply couldn’t drive this car anymore, no matter how impressive it was.

And so, today, I say goodbye. I won’t be buying a Tesla again. For those curious, Carvana was about 2K more than Lucid trade in offer and Carmax/KBB. Still sold at a loss, yes, I realize my privilege saying that. Lucid is now offering a 2K Tesla Trade-In bonus on select states that makes it more compelling even if the Carvana price is better but I just went for the simplicity of trading in with them.

That's 9,539 a quarter on average. 2023 had largely similar numbers (50k total), 2022 had 25k total deliveries. That's somewhere around 90k making some SWAGs about RDVs since it's generally hard to figure out. The biggest problem with all of this is there's several R1Ss sold for every R1T.

Ford sold 33,510 lightnings in 2024 or 8,377 a quarter. Add 2022 (15.6k) and 2023 (24k) sales and about 73k lightnings have been sold on an upward trend.

TL;DR: There are more R1 vehicles than cybertrucks but more cybertrucks than R1Ts. Lightnings appear to generally be the best selling EV truck. Cybertrucks briefly outsold everyone, peaking at a rate of 15k a quarter for at least a month but that seems to have ended.

ETA: using the 1:3 ratio of R1S:R1T from the report linked by SPorterBridges, that's roughly 31k R1Ts, probably the 46k cybertrucks from the recall and. 73k lightnings, and 126k total R1 vehicles.

[Elon Musk:] Well, there are a lot of these Teslas driving around the world all the time, and very seldom does anything like this happen … I just don’t want people thinking that Teslas aren’t safe.

[Interviewer:] Was this Tesla safe?

[Elon Musk:] Well I was thinking more about the other ones.

[Elon Musk:] Well, ‘cause the front fell off, and two more Teslas it was towing spilled onto the road and caught fire when their lithium batteries got punctured. It’s a bit of a give-away. I would just like to make the point that that is not normal.

There are 3 things you need to understand for this to make sense:
1: For the most part, people speak and act according to how things make them feel, and we use our logical reasoning less than we think we do, unless the individual is aware of this and has taken appropriate measures to correct it. They speak and respond affirmatively towards things they feel like are good or they agree with (usually in regards to whether it tracks with their internal perception of the world, which is a horribly subjective and unreliable thing)

2: Common sources of information in America are woefully dishonest as they use a mixture of unreliable primary sources and emotional appeals to spread the narrative they want people to believe. People tend to think major news outlets like CNN and MSNBC support the democrats and Fox supports the republicans. That’s really an oversimplification and frankly outdated, since it’s more complicated now and people are also experiencing social echo chambers that radicalize them.

3: In the left wing world where people supported Kamala, Elon has been vilified for several years now, ever since he bought Twitter (which he claimed to have done in part to fight censorship); because Trump won with Elon’s support, they are angry that “the enemy” won, and are acting emotionally, and lashing out against something they associate with Elon.",1715,True,1742669373.0,2025-03-22 19:49:33,2,0,Hiscabibbel,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/1jhbcbb/explain_it_to_me_like_im_10/mj6rwz6/,True,,2025,elon,hot,False,False,0,mj6rwz6

post,1jibfwl,,How to Balance a Fork Starship like Elon!,"Balancing silverware like Elon Musk, as seen in viral videos from events like the Mar-a-Lago dinner on March 15, 2025, involves understanding basic physics principles such as center of mass, weight distribution, and friction. While the exact method Musk used in those clips (e.g., balancing a fork and spoons on his finger or constructing a ""fork starship"") varies depending on the scenario, here’s a general guide to help you replicate a similar silverware-balancing trick:Steps to Balance Silverware

1. Choose Your Silverware: Start with a fork and a spoon, as these are common utensils Musk has been seen using. A fork’s tines and a spoon’s bowl provide useful points for balancing or interlocking.
2. Understand Center of Mass: The key to balancing is finding the point where the weight of the silverware is evenly distributed. For a single utensil, this is usually near the middle of its length. When combining multiple pieces, you’ll adjust this based on how they connect.
3. Basic Finger Balancing (Single Utensil):
   * Hold a fork or spoon lightly between your thumb and index finger.
   * Slide your grip along its length until it balances horizontally without tipping. This is the simplest trick, akin to balancing a pencil, and might resemble Musk’s finger-balancing act seen in some clips.
4. Stacking or Interlocking (Multiple Pieces):
   * Fork and Spoon Method: Hook the tines of a fork into the handle of a spoon (or vice versa) so they form a stable connection. Adjust their angles until the combined structure balances on your finger or a surface. Friction between the pieces helps hold them together.
   * Counterbalance Technique: Position one utensil (e.g., a spoon) to extend in one direction and another (e.g., a fork) in the opposite direction. For example, rest the spoon’s bowl on a table edge and angle the fork’s tines downward to counterweight it, tweaking until it holds steady.

#Trump’s Aggression Sours Europe on US Cloud Giants

###Companies in the EU are starting to look for ways to ditch Amazon, Google, and Microsoft cloud services amid fears of rising security risks from the US. But cutting ties won’t be easy.

> The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti–Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.

> There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies’ cloud services—including servers, storage, and databases—citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.

> “There’s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,” says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.

> The moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become “more technologically independent” and saying the status quo creates “security and reliability risks.",8585,True,1742802557.0,2025-03-24 08:49:17,10142,641,YourFuture2000,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jilfwg/companies_in_the_eu_are_starting_to_look_for_ways/,True,0.97,2025,both,top,False,False,0,

Elon Musk recently said that ""the biggest weakness of the West was empathy."" I don’t want to strawman him—I genuinely want to understand what he meant.

Surely, he can’t be referring to the fundamental human trait of empathy—the very thing that, alongside intelligence, likely gave us the biggest evolutionary advantage over other species and helped us become the dominant force on this planet. Even conservative evolutionary biologists wouldn’t deny that. Empathy allowed us to build large, cooperative societies, which had a clear advantage over smaller, fragmented groups. If the majority of humans didn’t have empathy and we had all always resembled a person with ASPD, I’m sure we would still be living in caves. There's maybe a point that it could be advantageous if our leaders were psychopaths, I wouldn't like that but I can see the logic behind...

If you were to remove empathy completely, what would you replace it with to maintain a functioning civilization? The only alternative I can think of is something like the Borg in *Star Trek*—pure collectivism hive mind without emotional connection nor personal freedom.

comment,1jizskm,1jizskm,,"Two ways to see it.

The first is he is using ""empathy"" to mean ""actions taken in the name of empathy"".  There are a great number of really bad ideas that sound like you are being nice.  I made a list a little while ago, but I would like to think that most people know what I am talking about.  Giving money to an alcoholic because you feel bad for him might seem nice, but is probably helping to feed his addiction and eventually end his life.  We have a lot of that going on right now, and this was the way I thought he meant it.

The second way, and the way I am starting to understand it, is that our empathy is being used against us.  It's related to the first, but is more that somebody will try to force you to agree with them by using guilt trips.  When a beggar tells you that you have to give them money or else you are hurting them, this is using our empathy as a vulnerability.

Or another example: when your child claims you don't love them if you won't let them go to a party, that is a trivial example of an attempt to use empathy against you.  

And of course this tactic has not gone unnoticed on a geopolitical scale. 

This is not new.  I think you would agree with that, right?  What \*is\* new is the sheer scale of the current attempts to use it against us, and the almost laughably transparent lack of any real argument that would perhaps bolster empathy as a legitimate persuasion technique.

The lefts main argument is that he is an unelected official affecting government policy (ie not confirmed by the senate). These actions are causing government agencies to be shuddered and public funding to be slashed at local communities (ie departments of education, department that funds public libraries, parks and wildlife, etc). 

There are plenty of counter arguments, my first being that there are articles that allow private citizens to give goods and services to government for free (like software and service), which is what Elon is doing, to identify waste and fraud in many agencies. So, essentially they have circumvented Elon being confirmed by the senate. This is good because this allows the government to allow quickly without being bogged down by the swamp of judges, media, and politics. 

I believe if people spent some time listening to other viewpoints and understood the goal of this administration, while also listening to the other side, they would be more inclined to cheer the wins and still be honest enough to point out the short comings (which there have been).

""Canada has frozen $43 million in payments to Tesla pending a line-by-line investigation into its last-minute surge in EV rebate claims made on the final weekend of the government program.

The American EV maker run by U.S. presidential adviser Elon Musk will also be excluded from all future EV rebate programs as long as tariffs are in place, former transport minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement.

The stop-payment order appears to have been made before the current election was called Sunday, though Freeland only confirmed it Tuesday, while on the campaign trail for her University—Rosedale seat.

“As soon as I became Transport Minister, I asked the department to stop all payments for Tesla vehicles in order to fully examine each claim individually and determine whether all are eligible and valid. No payments will be made until we are confident that the claims are valid,” she said in a statement texted to the Star.

“I also directed my department to change the eligibility criteria for future iZEV programs to ensure that Tesla vehicles will not be eligible for incentive programs so long as the illegitimate and illegal U.S. tariffs are imposed against Canada.”""

The decision was confirmed by Chrystia Freeland, who was recently appointed as Transport Minister. According to Freeland, the freeze was ordered before the election was called, and payments will remain suspended until every claim submitted by Tesla is reviewed individually.

“No payments will be made until we are confident that the claims are valid,” said Freeland in a statement to the Tornoto Star. “I also directed my department to change the eligibility criteria for future iZEV programs to ensure that Tesla vehicles will not be eligible for incentives so long as the illegitimate and illegal U.S. tariffs are imposed against Canada.”

The move comes in response to a last-minute surge in rebate claims submitted by Tesla in the final days of the iZEV program. According to government data, Tesla filed thousands of claims in just 72 hours that exhausted the remaining funds in the program nearly overnight. While many are claiming Tesla abused the program, the more likely scenario is that Tesla rushed to file claims for cars it had already sold, but not yet sought the rebate.",1760,True,1742987213.0,2025-03-26 12:06:53,66,0,chrisdh79,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1jk95cu/canada_freezes_43_million_in_tesla_ev_kickbacks/mjtb0bc/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mjtb0bc

Tesla is not a traditional dealership, in that they operate their own stores.  This could be something as simple as ""Tesla had a paperwork backlog and funneled everything through this one store"" or it can be Tesla straight up abusing the rebate system.

The reality is that no one knows what happened, just that it did, and every time another province excludes Tesla, they bring up this story as an ""explanation"" of ""one of the reasons"" why this is happening, but as of yet, we don't know the specifics behind what Tesla was doing with the rebates.

It *looks* shady, but let's not forget that the internet was *ablaze* about how [Tesla ""lost"" $1.4 billion dollars](https://archive.ph/Au7wY), and now the publication has [written a retraction](https://archive.ph/evAlg) regarding it.

*Bad news* about Tesla will always get more click and attention than good news, because that's how people feel about Tesla at the moment.

And in that time, Elon made the engineering challenge around FSD substantially more difficult with the decision to remove radar. All so they could navigate sensor shortages and still make deliveries. I would not be surprised if in a year Elon says, ""Were still so close, but we need to add radar (or lidar or a HW upgrade or something else)"".


Goalpost is perpetually moving.


EDIT: And the ""functionality"" he promised this year? Limited ""robotaxis"" with full-time human drivers. It's a all for show. It's like a carrot on the end of stick: he wiggles it close to your face and pulls it away, always just out of reach, but close enough to keep you hopeful.",917,False,1743030679.0,2025-03-27 00:11:19,11,0,CheesypoofExtreme,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1jjzhks/tesla_cybercab_robotaxi_to_add_10x_value_to_the/mjx61xk/,True,,2025,both,hot,False,False,0,mjx61xk

For me, I absolutely despise the fact that if I want to go faster, I have to change the behavior to standard or hurry, but then it makes more lane changes. All I want, and probably most everyone, is the ability to have the card drive faster while still keeping lane changes minimal. On top of that, there are times I wanted to stay in the left lane or the right lane, but it will constantly make changes to stay out of those lanes, which is infuriating. No matter how good it gets, we will also have preferences on where we want to be.

""Billionaires can have a significant impact on society, both positive and negative, depending on how they use their wealth and influence. Here are some potential benefits they can bring:

1. **Economic Growth and Job Creation**: Many billionaires build companies that employ thousands—or even millions—of people. Think of entrepreneurs like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, whose ventures (Tesla, SpaceX, Amazon) have created jobs and driven innovation in tech, logistics, and space exploration. Their investments can stimulate economies, especially in emerging industries.

2. **Innovation and Problem-Solving**: Wealth at that scale often funds risky, ambitious projects that governments or smaller entities might not tackle. For example, Musk’s push for sustainable energy or Gates’ work on global health through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation show how billionaires can accelerate progress on big challenges.

3. **Philanthropy**: Some billionaires redirect their fortunes into solving societal problems. Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, via the Giving Pledge, encourage billionaires to donate most of their wealth to causes like education, healthcare, and poverty reduction. This can fill gaps where public funding falls short.

comment,1jm8bn2,1jm8bn2,,"I think there’s 2 groups of xAI shareholders to consider.

Firstly, the hands-off Investors - these are the same people who helped Musk pay for the last 10% of Twitter in 2022 that he wasn’t going to personally pay for or use loans for. As X went down in value in 2022/2023, and xAI was getting started, these investors were given the ability to invest in xAI in its very early stages in 2023. They have made a ton already by getting that early access to invest in xAI in the seed round. Everybody wanted to pay to invest in xAI in 2023 when it was super cheap, but only a select few were given the opportunity.

They probably just want to maintain a good relationship with Musk so they can get in early in future ventures of his, since that is so valuable. They also defer these decisions to him because they trust him to create value. They are happily hitched to the Musk train.

Secondly, the Employees who have received stock in xAI as part of their salary compensation. They are probably the most likely to be annoyed at this deal, but at the same time, Musk being Musk is how xAI got started in the first place, how the talent was attracted and the team formed, and how it gained the Tweet data and Grok placement in the X app, leading it to its current 80B valuation. 

They probably don’t like this deal on its own, but hitching their wagon to Musk is working out for them in general.",2476,True,1743235354.0,2025-03-29 09:02:34,14,0,NotGonnaLie59,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/1jm8bn2/xai_ceo_elon_musk_buys_x_from_ceo_elon_musk_for/mkbqb9s/,True,,2025,both,hot,False,False,0,mkbqb9s
comment,1jm8bn2,1jm8bn2,,"There have been a lot of numbers thrown around about the value of Twitter the last couple years. It’s confusing because people often don’t mention the 12b of debt and how that factors in to the numbers they’re mentioning. 

In the middle of 2022, Musk was trying to pull out of the deal, claiming Twitter had significantly undercounted the number of bot accounts. He said at 44b he was “obviously overpaying”. A court forced him to complete the transaction though.

So in October 2022, the old Twitter shareholders received 44b (actual money), which was funded by like 29b from Musk, like 3b from other investors, and then they the new company X took on 12b of debt to complete the deal. Musk probably gave a personal guarantee to the banks or offered collateral, but it was X’s debt to pay back on a day to day basis. X was paying the interest on that debt. Musk was just the safety net for it.

The best way to look at it, old Twitter did not have this 12B debt, but new Twitter did, so even if it was worth 44B at the time of sale, it was instantly worth 32B the day after the sale once new Twitter had all this debt on its books.

Since we know Musk overpaid at 44B (everybody agrees), we could subtract like (guessing here) 6B more to account for what a fair price would actually be. So that puts the value down to like 26B the day after it was purchased for 44B.",3024,True,1743238878.0,2025-03-29 10:01:18,67,0,NotGonnaLie59,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/1jm8bn2/xai_ceo_elon_musk_buys_x_from_ceo_elon_musk_for/mkbve4d/,True,,2025,elon,hot,False,False,0,mkbve4d

comment,1jo5rr7,1jo5rr7,,"Full story:

""70-year-old Meridian man faces aggravated battery charges after allegedly striking a counter-protester with his vehicle during dueling demonstrations outside a Tesla dealership Saturday.

Christopher Talbot was arrested after police said he made an obscene gesture toward a 49-year-old man and then hit him with his car during protests at the dealership on Franklin Road. The incident occurred on March 29 around 1 p.m. amid tensions between protesters opposing Elon Musk's political activities and a larger group supporting the billionaire businessman.

About 30 protesters attended the ""Tesla Takedown"" demonstration organized by groups called Troublemakers and The Disruption Project. At the same time, close to 200 counter-protesters mobilized by the Idaho Liberty Dogs appeared in support of Musk and the dealership. 

According to the Meridian Police Department (MPD), the victim had been driving a truck displaying pro-Trump flags and had just parked and exited his vehicle when Talbot allegedly struck him. The victim recorded Talbot's license plate before driving himself to a local hospital, where he was treated and released for non-life-threatening injuries.

The original protest targeted Musk's involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency, nicknamed DOGE. Organizers claimed on social media that ""Elon Musk is destroying our democracy, and he's using the fortune he built from Tesla to do it. We are taking action at Tesla to stop Musk's illegal coup.",1920,True,1743453513.0,2025-03-31 22:38:33,12,0,berevasel,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/1jo5rr7/msn_idaho_man_arrested_after_allegedly_hitting/mkqxg2p/,True,,2025,both,hot,False,False,0,mkqxg2p

post,1jq4hf3,,US Senate passed bill by slim margin in a 51-48 vote to block Trump's tariffs on imports from Canada,"4 Republicans cross the floor to vote with Democrats to pass a bill that would remove import tariffs on Canadian goods.

This still needs to pass the house (which has republican majority), and even if it passes the house, president can still veto. At which point it goes back to the senate and 2/3 need to vote to overturn the veto.

Low chance, but indication that dissent is happening within party lines given the economic downturn of tariff policy.

Interesting to see how many more house reps and senators break from party lines after today's ""liberation"" tariffs have time to impact markets and consumer prices

post,1jqyy5b,,US Equities lost 90%-and took 25 years to recover.,"Everyone is saying ""dip dip dip"" as if we are experiencing an overreaction to a small segment bubble. 

95 years ago the US levied the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, worldwide tariffs that were designed to encourage domestic production and punish ""cheating countries"". This kicked off a trade war that had no small part in causing a world-wide depression. 

The US has not levied global tariffs of this degree since then. Until yesterday.

What happened to US equities?  After a roaring bull run during which wealth was printed and the every-day man flung money in the market it crashed. But not overnight. In fits and starts the DJI lost 90% of its value over a 3 year period. 

It took *25* years for it to return to an ATH. 

Trump has fired 10s of thousands of federal employees. He's spiking unemployment. He's taxing imports to the tune of 50-100%. Other countries will do the same to us. Our companies will start having mass layoffs, crushing economic activity and investment. Domestic production will not return, everyone one will be out of money to buy stuff anyways. The SH tariffs did nothing to encourage domestic manufacturing, it just made everyone poorer. 

Maybe our monetary policy will prevent a Great Depression and we escape with ""only"" 8-10 percent unemployment, mild stagflation and the market takes 3-5 years to recover after a 50% fall.
 
I'd love to hear the thesis of *why* the market will recover or be higher in the next 12-24 months when we have a historical model staring us in the face.

i don't like trump at all and think that his economic model is absolutely stupid. but i also feel like comparing the great depression and the DJI tanking 90% isn't good history... like trump use of mckinley when it comes to tariffs. 

the global market (and regulation too) is far past the point of a great depression happening. while the US is doing it's best to outright gut everything in regulation, in 1930s america there was practically no social net, no digital economy, no FDIC, not even fucking social security lmfao. that is why the smoot-hawley furthered the depression into unimaginable levels.

comment,1jqyy5b,1jqyy5b,,">All these companies are going to see their share of business done outside the United States plummet

I do wonder about this. For the most part, anyone outside the US doing business with Apple and Google and Microsoft aren't trading with those companies' US entities; they're contracting with legal entities in Ireland or elsewhere. There is no part of an iPhone that is made in the US except the IP, and that can be transfer priced in very creative ways. AWS and Microsoft have data centres all over the world. Everything NVIDIA makes is physically produced in Taiwan. And Teslas sold in Australia (rapid sales volume drop notwithstanding) are built in China. 

These companies (except maybe Tesla) aren't stupid. None of them are going to want to go down with the ship, and they will find ways to protect their interests. And customers are mostly rational too: Unless Tim Cook starts doing Musk salutes nobody is setting their iPhone on fire.

comment,1jtlvn7,1jtlvn7,,"From the article: Tesla has made a significant update to its Safety Score, removing one of the most controversial metrics – Forward Collision Warnings (FCW)- from the system’s formula. The removal of FCW comes as the company is dealing with a potential class action lawsuit claiming the metric artificially inflated insurance premiums.

Tesla first introduced its Safety Score system to Tesla Insurance in 2021. The system uses real-time driving telemetry to determine scores for several metrics, such as Hard Braking, Aggressive Turning, and more, all of which combine into one overall Safety Score. This score is then used to determine your monthly Tesla Insurance premiums. If you have a good, or high, Safety Score you get a lower insurance premium than someone who has a low Safety Score.

There was one metric that was particularly controversial, and that was FCW. According to Tesla, FCWs were triggered “in events where a possible collision due to an object in front of the vehicle is considered likely without driver intervention.” However, ask any Tesla owner and they will say the FCW system is far from perfect, often giving out false positives when there was no real danger of a collision.

It was enough of a problem that one owner from Illinois filed a potential class action lawsuit against the company, claiming customers were being overcharged on their monthly insurance premiums based on these false warnings.",1738,True,1744034353.0,2025-04-07 15:59:13,83,0,chrisdh79,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1jtlvn7/tesla_removes_forward_collision_warnings_from/mlv432s/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mlv432s

comment,1jtlvn7,1jtlvn7,,"Good, FCW is worthless for this purpose. Don't get me wrong, as a safety feature it's great, and it SHOULD be generally over-protective.

But if you use it to determine premiums, it has to be near-perfect, and arguably it should err towards false negative rather than false positives, which is what it does today.

In our neighborhood, there are a few lazily-curving streets with parallel parking, and even taking it at/below the 15-25mph speed limit, each day we get 4-5 FCW panic beeps from the Model X as it reliably mistakes a parked car on the side of the road for one it thinks we are going to hit, even though that car is clearly off the projected path.

The last 5% is what took Waymo and others years and years to close that gap. This is one field where the last 5% takes 95% of the time.

If you are experiencing *any* disengagement at all, then it's years away from where it needs to be to be fully autonomous on public roads.

If one day the whole Tesla community are all saying they are not seeing *any* disengagement for months at a time, then we know we are close.

comment,1jtv8dx,1jtv8dx,,"That's incorrect. The accident rate while manually driving is actually much higher than the accident rate while using FSD. Why? Because not only has FSD itself become a much more competent driver over time, but also because you can intervene when necessary, and it effectively becomes like having two sets of eyes and brains driving at the same time, where one can catch the other's mistakes. So if you were truly concerned about your life and other people's lives, you'd want to be using FSD. It is factually safer than manually driving.

Also, you're acting as if you must fully rely on FSD. No, you can take over. Eventually it will be good enough where you can fully rely on it, but we're not there yet.

post,1jyghal,,Tariffs are back on Trump says!,"**Trump on Truth Social**: NOBODY is getting “off the hook” for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst! There was no Tariff “exception” announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff “bucket.” The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER! The Golden Age of America, which includes the upcoming Tax and Regulation Cuts, a substantial amount of which was just approved by the House and Senate, will mean more and better paying Jobs, making products in our Nation, and treating other Countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us. The bottom line is that our Country will be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

This is why you don't believe any news over the weekend unless Trump or the White House covers on it. Tariffs are back on now!

On the other hand, Tesla had to halt production during an expansion period because they over promised and under delivered, causing many people to cancel their pre-orders, including myself. I think that's more telling than stopping production during a down period.

comment,1jz3t3i,1jz3t3i,,"That’s a fair question, but they actually use very different approaches.

Waymo is built around pre-existing, highly detailed map knowledge and localizes itself within that map to execute driving decisions. Tesla FSD is designed to dynamically perceive and respond to the environment without relying on prior mapping.

This difference directly impacts generalization.

* With a system based on pre-mapped environments, deployment becomes slow and expensive because every operational area needs to be mapped, validated, and continuously revalidated.
* A system that dynamically perceives and adapts can theoretically scale indefinitely, which is why FSD has already been deployed broadly, including its expansion into China.

There are pros and cons to each approach:

* Pre-existing map knowledge can provide very strong performance initially within its operational domain.
* Dynamic perception is harder to perfect but ultimately more flexible and scalable.

So while legal and policy constraints do affect Waymo, it’s likely not the only reason they are limited to specific areas. Their core technical approach inherently makes large-scale generalization and rapid deployment much harder.",1190,False,1744668283.0,2025-04-15 00:04:43,3,0,standardphysics,teslamotors,https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1jz3t3i/tesla_rt_elonmusk_for_the_first_time_there_will/mn4wqxc/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mn4wqxc

The claim isn't ""oh noes it's not a physically measured odometer!"". The claim is that it is deliberately inaccurate. If that's true, it could end up being a huge lawsuit.

(Reuters) - Tesla faces a proposed class action claiming it speeds up odometers on its electric vehicles so they fall out of warranty faster, saving Elon Musk's company from having to pay for repairs.

The plaintiff Nyree Hinton alleged that Tesla odometer readings reflect energy consumption, driver behavior and ""predictive algorithms"" rather than actual mileage driven.

He said the odometer on the 2020 Model Y he bought in December 2022 with 36,772 miles on the clock ran at least 15% fast, based on his other vehicles and driving history, and for a while said he drove 72 miles a day when at most he drove 20.

Hinton, a Los Angeles resident, said this caused his 50,000-mile basic warranty to expire well ahead of schedule, leaving him with a $10,000 suspension repair bill that he thought Tesla should cover.

""By tying warranty limits and lease mileage caps to inflated 'odometer' readings, Tesla increases repair revenue, reduces warranty obligations, and compels consumers to purchase extended warranties prematurely,"" the complaint said.

Tesla and its lawyer did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment, but have denied all material allegations in the lawsuit. The Austin, Texas-based company does not have a media relations office.

Hinton is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for Tesla drivers in California, potentially encompassing more than 1 million vehicles, court papers show.

Tesla moved his lawsuit this month to Los Angeles federal court from a state court in that city.

The automaker has also faced litigation accusing it of inflating vehicle driving ranges.

In March 2024, a federal judge in Oakland, California said drivers in that case must pursue their claims in individual arbitrations, not a class action.

The case is Hinton v Tesla Inc et al, U.S.",2045,True,1744927363.0,2025-04-18 00:02:43,8734,329,callsonreddit,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k1p0mo/tesla_speeds_up_odometers_to_avoid_warranty/,True,0.98,2025,both,top,False,False,0,

If it rolls over (more common for that period of time American made cars had odometers that only went 5 digits), have to include that. Not to mention mileage is recorded by corporations and self employed people as part of business expenses. Even accuracy is regulated and they need to be within 5-10% of actual without the manufacturer getting in serious trouble.

post,1k5g9yj,,Tesla reports disappointing quarterly results as automotive revenue plunges 20%,"Tesla reported a miss on the top and bottom lines in its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday as automotive revenue plunged 20% from a year earlier.

Here are the key numbers compared with LSEG expectations.

* **Earnings per share**: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated
* **Revenue**: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated

Total revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

It’s been a brutal start to the year for Tesla, with CEO Elon Musk spending much of his time in President Donald Trump’s White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. The president’s sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment, automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells.

Tesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday.

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

In its shareholder deck, Tesla cautioned investors that “uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers.",3889,True,1745352789.0,2025-04-22 22:13:09,13950,974,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k5g9yj/tesla_reports_disappointing_quarterly_results_as/,True,0.96,2025,both,top,False,False,0,

But objectively speaking, Waymo is currently driving autonomously, while Tesla is not.

All of this stuff about ""scalability"" is just a momentary distraction.  Sure, tesla has shown they can build factories, and pump out vehicles at scale.  But how many Cybercabs have been mass produced to date?

post,1kbesxa,,I talked with a Chinese factory owner to see what’s happening on the ground. TL;DR: China has mobilized tons of resources to exporters but there’s some signs of pain,"I’m an American in China but have been seeing very little foreign reporting about what’s happening in China, which is weird to me because it seems pretty important to get a clear picture of the trade war. So here’s what I learned from him.

**Gov support**

-The local government is helping and giving him low interest rate loans / short term financial support. This type of thing is very common throughout China right now - lots of local govs are mobilizing to support exporters thru the tariff war. Li Qiang, central gov minister, says central government help is probably coming too 

-Guangzhou, and I assume others too, has also organized tons of seminars since Liberation Day with buyers from Europe, Latin America, and Asia. A big source of replacement demand for his factory has been from these

-He’s getting lots of buyers from TikTok shops overseas. It seems like TikTok is helping a lot to mitigate the demand impact 

-The news story of Walmart, Target, Costco, etc. resuming some orders is true, he confirmed it. But the amounts are **very, very** small

**Pain**

-He’s already re-evaluating employees and firing some soon. He said most exporters in Guangzhou are cutting some employees, but extremely US dependent exporters have furloughed most of their workforces until mid May

**Some good news for the U.S?**

-Before Liberation Day he was building a factory in the US and has now fully committed to it. But it’s having issues since the raw materials are sourced from China and they’re getting hit with tariffs

[The full interview is here](https://www.yaphete.com/p/live-from-the-trade-war-2-chinas), I didn’t write everything here. Knowing the relative strength and ability of China or the US to withstand the tariff war is super important to trading right now I believe",1790,False,1746014813.0,2025-04-30 14:06:53,3557,427,TheOneTrueThrowaway1,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kbesxa/i_talked_with_a_chinese_factory_owner_to_see/,True,0.97,2025,tesla,top,False,False,0,

Referring to his company Neuralink, which has implanted technology in people's brains that enables them to manipulate computers with their thoughts, Musk noted, ""@Neuralink had to use a robot for the brain-computer electrode insertion, as it was impossible for a human to achieve the required speed and precision.""

In response to Musk's prediction, GOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah opined, ""Sounds like a win for humans.""

I am not comfortably situated living with my parents, and am able to help them in daily living, while running my business.  And, my cost of living is low, which helps me to get through the rough periods of my business.

comment,1kn6wgq,1kn6wgq,,"Since I don't know much about existing laws in SA, I had to ask Gemini about it. This is what the response was:

Elon Musk's claim touches on a complex and highly debated issue in South Africa. Here's a breakdown of the situation:  



* **Historical Context:**
   * South Africa has a deeply troubled history of racial segregation and discrimination under the apartheid regime.  
   * Since the end of apartheid in 1994, the government has implemented various policies aimed at addressing the legacy of past injustices and promoting equality. These policies often involve affirmative action measures.  
* **Affirmative Action and Current Laws:**
   * South Africa has laws like the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) Act and the Employment Equity Act, which aim to redress past economic imbalances by giving preference to previously disadvantaged groups, primarily black South Africans.  
   * These laws can, in certain circumstances, result in what some perceive as discrimination against non-black individuals.
* **The Claim of 142 Discriminatory Laws:**
   * The claim that South Africa has ""passed 142 laws forcing discrimination against anyone who is not black"" seems to originate from research by the Institute of Race Relations (IRR), a South African think tank.
   * The IRR has identified numerous pieces of legislation, regulations, and policies that they argue contain race-based criteria, often in the context of affirmative action and Black Economic Empowerment.",2871,True,1747312956.0,2025-05-15 14:42:36,60,0,_tube_,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/1kn6wgq/elon_south_africa_has_now_passed_142_laws_forcing/msfu8s4/,True,,2025,elon,hot,False,False,0,msfu8s4
comment,1kn6wgq,1kn6wgq,,"I am far from an expert in South Africa, with what I know from news and former South African co-workers, Elon Musk’s recent comments aren’t entirely out of line with the current situation. South Africa today faces serious challenges, including widespread corruption, persistent governance issues, and policies that some argue result in discrimination against white citizens. Even when the policies themselves are defensible in principle, they’re frequently distorted by a system plagued by corruption and mismanagement.

With that said, Elon Musk is probably missing one key thing beyond his race: he likely needs to grease the right wheels to be granted a license in South Africa. The people who succeed in modern South Africa don't just need to be black, they often have to have the right connections and be willing to pay officials. I think it is fair to say that the current state of South Africa is a disgrace to what Nelson Mandela was trying to create.

I'm not trying to pick a side on this issue, just pointing out that South Africa is not a high-trust pluralistic country like most developed nations people on Reddit are likely familiar with. They're a country that struggles with providing basic necessities (like electricity to their citizens) and has issues with widespread crime due to how they're government is currently managed.",1536,True,1747324688.0,2025-05-15 17:58:08,11,0,Chemical_Signal2753,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/1kn6wgq/elon_south_africa_has_now_passed_142_laws_forcing/msgvp4q/,True,,2025,elon,hot,False,False,0,msgvp4q

post,1kq07vd,,"Who here is daily-driving 20+ year-old cars, and has it worked out?","My parents are in a bit of a financial hole and to help them out, I gave them my paid-off 2020 model year car with 40k miles.  They sold their most valuable car (they had two) to stay afloat. 

Some will argue I should’ve let them consolidate down to one of their own while I kept mine, but part of the reason they are in bad financial shape is because they bought things to keep up with the joneses without budgeting for maintenance. And since they’re providing the roof over my head, I kinda have to give into their demands until I live on my own again. 

Since I’m mechanically-inclined and they aren’t, they gave me their old Mercedes ML320 to drive around while I job hunt. This car has lots of deferred maintenance but it is drivable. 

Now I’m thinking when I do start working again, maybe I should just go all-in and refurbish this car as much as I can to prevent tying up cash into a car payment again. It seems to be what a lot of my friends and old colleagues are doing. 



Edit: woah, this is an incredible amount of input. Glad to hear of everyone’s experiences. I guess my goal is to make it through this rough patch as much as I can manage, knowing full well there are better options out there later on. The fact that many have done so is hugely reassuring.

comment,1kq07vd,1kq07vd,,"I was dalying a 20 year old vehicle until about a month ago. It can work, and I was able to save a ton of money over the past \~5 years because I had it. I had had it for a long time before that, I landed a very well paying job in 2021 (and can work from home most days) so I was able to bank 50-75% of my paycheck each month until I started grad school last August. Even while paying for grad school, I am still saving a decent amount each month from my paycheck, it's just not that much when I factor in the cost of classes.

That being said, it can be risky. At that point because of general wear and tear it's a matter of when and how frequently things will go wrong, not if. Also, parts can start becoming an issue after about 15 years. It got to the point where I was having transmission problems on my old vehicle (yes it was maintained) and would regularly have small things break (ex power window regulator here, door lock there). Sometimes, like when my wiper arm snapped in half, the part just didn't exist anymore, even aftermarket, so I had to call 20 different pull-a-part places to see if they had a the same vehicle in stock with a build date of after January 2005 but before the 2008 model year with the passenger side wiper arm intact to find a wiper arm.

post,1kqq4o9,,EV’s have been taking off in my city and I finally figured out why,"I live in a pretty rural area of western Pennsylvania and after paying a bit of attention to the specific cars around me, I got a good idea of how many EV’s were in my city. Outside of my own I had only ever really seen a couple Tesla’s but they weren’t popular. Less than 10, probably closer to 5 throughout the city. 

Over the past year there were a couple more that popped up including an EV9, and a Nissan Ariya. I’ve seen a couple chevy’s, both Blazers and equinox, and even a mustang. But the last couple months they’ve exploded. In My neighborhood there are 4 prologues out of nowhere. They’re easy to identify since I work from home and my desk is by the window near the stop sign. I always hear them as they come to a stop (the prologues are actually pretty loud with their hums) and they’re three different colors and the fourth has a bunch of decals. I’ve also seen some new blazers around. 

I stopped in at a local shop and was talking to the owner like normal and she mentioned getting a Blazer. Last person I would’ve thought, and 70+ year old lady on the verge of retirement. I asked what made her switch and she explained. She took her ICE in to get it serviced and the dealer made a new policy. Any loaner vehicle that wasn’t kept overnight required to be an EV. She said it was the safest and most comfortable she’s ever been in a car. She said she got her car back and that’s really when she felt how much she missed the car. She went back 2 weeks later to buy what she test drove. And the family that owns the dealership she goes to also owns the Honda dealership. 

That’s the biggest obstacle. Getting people to drive one, not necessarily buy them. Obviously the end goal is to buy and get more on the road, but instead of just talk talk talk, focus on just getting people to drive one. She wasn’t encouraged to buy it, just given it for a day. And that’s likely what happened with a lot of the prologues. GM and Honda are massive brands and have a lot of brand loyalty.",2261,True,1747696292.0,2025-05-20 01:11:32,1796,516,Buckles01,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kqq4o9/evs_have_been_taking_off_in_my_city_and_i_finally/,True,0.98,2025,tesla,top,False,False,0,

comment,1kqq4o9,1kqq4o9,,"> And rental car companies foisting them on unsuspecting tourists was NOT a good idea. The worst thing to do is give someone an unfamiliar car with unknown ways to refuel in unknown territory. 

This.  As derisive as Tesla is at the moment, you can't argue their charging network.  But even here,  most chargers aren't that near airports. Not knowing how long it'll take to charge or how busy the charger is doesn't help either when there's a flight you need to catch.   

And this is the easiest to use option.  

CCS in North America?

comment,1kqg2i5,1kqg2i5,,"Retaining 90% capacity after 7000 hours of cycling at 40C would be incredible.

For reference, my 2.5 year old LFP Model 3 is already down to around 94-96% capacity, depending on how you measure, after only 631 hours of driving, which equates to 23.5k miles. So 7000 hours of cycling is probably in the 200k-300k miles ballpark, potentially more if you do mostly highway driving.

Edit: I should note, however, that even for current LFP batteries, most of the degradation seems to be from calendar aging, not cyclical (usage-based) aging, so other LFP Tesla owners with 2.5 year old cars likely have similar remaining capacity to me, regardless of whether they drove 5k miles or 50k miles.

post,1kqw8br,,Hyundai N Festival N2 Cup Massive Crash and Drama,"It looks like not a lot of the English-speaking community has picked this up, so I wanted to do a quick write up.

So, for the headline crash: during the Hyundai N Festival N2 Cup Masters championship, a massive 4-car crash happened at an estimated 110km/h: https://youtu.be/7LcXpZj4IY8?t=16818 (timestamped; 4:40:22 if it doesn't work)

Note car 017 is the first to crash; you can see them spinning out shortly after cutting to the drone view. 

Unfortunately, while nobody was killed, there are rumors that one racer has suffered 3 fractured bones.

Now for some context behind the drama:

**The Hyundai N Festival**

This is an annual event sponsored by Hyundai (and a few other companies like Kumho tire) and operated by ""Playground"" (just a separate LLC sponsored by Hyundai) where they have sponsor booths, food trucks, showcasing cars, etc. The highlight of the festival are the spec race series.

There are three classes: eN1, N1, and N2. [eN1 is run with moderately modified Ioniq 5N chassis with a rollcage, suspension, brakes, widebody, and mild aero.](https://www.hyundai-n.com/en/experience/n-festival/about-korea?tab=en1#img-area). [N1 is similarly modified, but with Elantra N instead](https://www.hyundai-n.com/en/experience/n-festival/about-korea?tab=n1#img-area)


**N2 Cup Woes**


N2 is the problem child. N2 is a mostly stock Elantra N with a bucket seat, half-rollcage, steering wheel, brake pads, and a spec semislick tire. 

No suspension modification of any kind, nor brake modifications are allowed. The point is that Hyundai is marketing a mostly-stock Elantra N can be driven in a wheel to wheel race and still be okay--if you're active in the US track scene, in fact it mostly is... on a track day.

Since the series began, the N2 cup was shrouded in some hot water. Almost every year, there was an incident where tires were debeading off of the wheels.",6404,True,1747715207.0,2025-05-20 06:26:47,164,20,hatsune_aru,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1kqw8br/hyundai_n_festival_n2_cup_massive_crash_and_drama/,True,0.98,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

comment,1kqzthf,1kqzthf,,"Huh, TIL Elon was a MS intern. He was also a banking intern: 

>While studying physics at Queen’s University in Canada during the early 1990s, Musk and his brother Kimbal cold-called numerous people they wanted to meet, including Peter Nicholson, a top executive at the Bank of Nova Scotia. Nicholson “was not in the habit of getting out-of-the-blue requests,” according to Ashlee Vance’s book “Elon Musk,” and he was impressed. As he put it, “I was perfectly prepared to have lunch with a couple of kids that had that kind of gumption.”

>Nicholson gave Musk a summer internship at the bank, where he earned about $14 an hour and got to pitch new ideas to his boss. For one project, Musk told Vance, he wrote up a proposal for a bond trade that he estimated could be “the biggest opportunity ever, and nobody seemed to realize.” His boss approved the pitch and passed it along to the bank’s CEO but, to Musk’s dismay, the CEO rejected the proposal.

>“Later in life, as I competed against the banks, I would think back to this moment, and it gave me confidence. All the bankers did was copy what everyone else did,” Musk told Vance. “If there was a giant pile of gold sitting in the middle of the room and nobody was picking it up, they wouldn’t pick it up either.”

>One of Musk’s takeaways was that “bankers are rich and dumb,” he told Vance, and he kept that in mind when, in 1999, Musk launched his finance start up X.com. The site merged with Confinity in 2000 and became PayPal.

What you are seeing is a byproduct of a larger wheel, that’s what people want aesthetically. The treadwear (grip) on the majority of “low pro” tires is for general commuting.

comment,1krw9j8,1krw9j8,,"From the article: Elon Musk says he intends to remain CEO of Tesla for at least the next five years, while saying the company is not experience issues with demand, expect in one market. The comments came during a video interview at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday, where Musk responded to questions about his political involvement, leadership at Tesla, and the company’s recent sales figures.

When asked directly if he saw himself continuing as Tesla’s CEO in five years’ time, Musk answered with a simple “Yes.” Pressed further, he added with a laugh, “I can’t be still here if I’m dead.”

Musk’s statements on his continued leadership comes amid growing scrutiny over his political ties and time commitments to projects beyond Tesla, including the U.S. government’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Along with his involvement in DOGE, Musk has donated at least $250 million in support of Trump’s re-election campaign, but that appears to be over, at least for now. Musk said, “I’ve done enough. If I see a reason to do political spending I will, but I don’t currently see a reason.

I do wonder where Tesla would be now if the Cybertruck carried on the winning formula of the Model 3 - make the most cost efficient decisions to create the best value EV for the mass market.

It would also help with towing on the model X

It's like buying a first edition land cruiser with $23k of dealer accessories and $8k of markup and then complaining about ""depreciation"" a year later when supply has caught up and you can get one OTD for under MSRP, doesn't make it any more or less successful of a truck for toyota.

post,1ktchqb,,The Lamborghini of Nauru's Police Chief?,"Seeking information regarding a Lamborghini reportedly located on the island nation of Nauru near Australia.

During a period of economic prosperity on Nauru, a story emerged about a police chief (or official) who acquired a Lamborghini. This individual was reportedly too large to comfortably operate the vehicle.

Request: Does anyone have factual information regarding this specific Lamborghini? This includes details such as the model year, any known history, or its current status. Photographic evidence would also be of interest.

I was able to find a BBC article mentioning it from 2008 mentioning it, but that was all I was able to find. Does anyone know which model it was, or what ended up happening to it? This would have been late 70's early 80's most likely. So possibly a Countach or Jalpa.

post,1ktfc9f,,"The Doha interview confirmed that car sales are still Tesla's anchor, and Musk is trying hard to blur this anchor.The crisis is coming quiet","The Doha interview confirmed that car sales are still Tesla's anchor, and Musk is trying hard to blur this anchor. He also hopes that investors will look to ten years later.

As an investor, it is very important to look forward to a better future, because this is the basic concept of investment. However, this does not mean that we only look at the future and not the fundamentals of a company, that is, the main business. Not to mention what if this so-called future is unreliable? This interview can confirm that Saudi investors are very dissatisfied with the sales of his cars, which is Musk's most hated topic. After all, he has said that he doesn't like the car business anymore, and he wants to make cooler Robotaxi, robots, and FSD. And these are all far away.

I know that many Tesla fans have been insisting on proving to everyone how great FSD is. But you know, although many people have shown that FSD can travel 300KM, even across the east and west of the United States without human intervention once. But on the NHTSA registration list, it is L2 autonomous driving. I even wonder why NHTSA allows FSD to be approved without holding the steering wheel. After all, it is only L2 instead of L3 or L4. Of course, this is not important. What is important is that the foundation of FSD today is not enough to support Robotaxi.

I have also met Tesla fans who told me, ""If FSD really doesn't work, at most we can add a lidar, which is not a difficult task."" When I used the logic of business school to analyze it for them, when lidar is added, the competitors will become WAYMO, and WAYMO has been leading for 5 years in using lidar and getting L4, so Tesla will have to catch up.

Tesla fans said contemptuously, ""So what, does WAYMO have a rocket? Can it take us to Mars?""

In the past, Musk could always say Next Year, but when Next Year has arrived, what should he do? Forever Mars plan?

post,1ktff15,,"Electric trains, buses and cycles are more efficient and practical ways of electrification than electric cars!","Electric trains and buses have existed for century. Massive transit systems like Newyork Subway, London underground, Paris metro, Moscow metro, trams and trolleys have been successfully fully running electricity for nearly a century. 

India has electrified 99% of their railway network. It's 75% for china. 70% for France and Spain. 55% for Russia and Germany.

Then we come to electric bikes. They are selling a lot more than electric cars even in USA where there isn't any proper cycling infrastructure.

https://www.bicycling.com/news/a39838840/ebikes-are-outpacing-electric-car-sales-in-the-us/

Trolley buses have existed for decades in many cities. From Moscow to Mexico city.

Electrification of buses with batteries are also a lot more successful than cars.

https://www.sustainable-bus.com/news/bloomberg-new-energy-finance-long-term-forecast-on-electric-buses-vehicles/


 You can have buses with much smaller batteries and use opportunity charging as buses would wait sometimes in terminal any way. Also it's much easier to implement battery swapping for buses than cars. Also in motion charging with trolley bus wires too is possible.

Then we come to resource consumption for cars vs public transportation. Let's take battery needed for electrification. Shenzen has a 100% electric bus fleet. An electric bus would mostly have 500 kWh battery pack. This can be reduced below 100 kWh by opportunity charging (like pantograph charging or battery swapping). Let's be conservative and assume you need 500 kWh battery per bus. And there is one bus per 500 residents in Shenzen. So it comes down to only 625 Wh/person. If they owned cars they would need atleast 15,000 Wh/person assuming one car with 60 kWh battery per a family of 4. This can go upto 60,000 Wh/person or even higher if there's one car per person.

You can also use trolley buses for very busy bus routes. Which would only need a very small battery.

Remember. Waymo uses cameras, LiDAR, and radar while Tesla uses camera only. And all you hear from these Tesla fans is that Waymo is too expensive and can't scale, but Tesla can and will pass them by. 

But *who cares* if it's more expensive? Imagine hopping on a plane and the builder of the plane said ""yeah, we got rid of a bunch of sensors and radar so that's it's cheaper. And you pay a lower ticket price!""

**Stage 1: Inception**

> TL;DR: Elon and Tesla capitalized on three key movements: the green movement, cultural status, and visionary leadership of the third industrial revolution.

To understand Tesla today, we need to look back 20 years. Tesla should never have succeeded. There has not been a new car company to sell over 9,000 cars (the DeLorean) in over 100 years before Tesla. Tesla's founders aimed to transform the world by developing an electric vehicle to propel the world toward a green future. Looking for new investments with his PayPal winnings, Elon joined the Tesla team. The founders had a vision and direction, but over time, Elon pushed for continually expanding changes and leveraged his funding and chairman status to execute a Coup d'état to become CEO.

To Elon's credit, it worked. The Roadster was a wild success. Elon leveraged this momentum to convince governments to create billions in long-term subsidies, which enabled them to establish a legitimate foundation as both an industrial power and a strong brand among those invested in the green revolution. He also leveraged this momentum to establish a powerful following of loyal customers who shared his mission and to attract top talent seeking a brighter future.

This also created a flywheel of success: Elon leverages his status to market a new revolutionary dream -> people believe him because of his previous success and the desire for it to be true -> personal or government funding is generated that drives this dream -> Elon forces through objections and doubt -> the dream is partially implemented -> Elon's status as a visionary leader is enhanced.",10221,True,1748006096.0,2025-05-23 15:14:56,30,25,Epicism,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ktjam4/tesla_vision_volatility_and_the_illusion_of/,True,0.73,2025,both,hot,False,False,0,

I used to own shares, but I am now so disgusted with Elon that I can't directly own anything he controls.

Just a matter of time before there is a bad accident with a Tesla autonomous vehicle, especially in rain or fog. That said, Ives has just given him a street high PT of $500 so there are big analysts out there who buy into the FSD and Optimus AI vision.

Bear Case

Given the negative public sentiment towards Tesla vehicles as part of Musk's participation with the Department of Government Efficiency \[DOGE\], the robotaxi program may be a risky endeavor given that the vehicles will be unsupervised on the road. Though I do not expect it to impact the program, there is the potential for vandalism and theft of the vehicles while on the road, potentially hindering the test phase, pushing out the mass adoption phase.

Industrial robotics may be a narrower market than anticipated, given the purpose-built robots on the market today.

Oracle will spend around $40bn on Nvidia’s high-performance computer chips to power OpenAI’s new giant US data centre, as tech groups race to build the vast infrastructure needed to underpin artificial intelligence models.

The site in Abilene, Texas, has been billed as the first US Stargate project, the $500bn data centre scheme spearheaded by OpenAI and SoftBank, and will provide 1.2 gigawatts of power when it is completed next year, making it one of the largest in the world.

Oracle will purchase around 400,000 of Nvidia’s GB200 chips — its latest “superchip” for training and running AI systems — and lease the computing power to OpenAI, according to several people familiar with the matter.

The site’s owners, Crusoe and US investment firm Blue Owl Capital, have raised $15bn in debt and equity to finance the Abilene project, which will encompass eight buildings and first broke ground in June last year.

The data centre is expected to be fully operational by mid-2026. Oracle has agreed to lease the site for 15 years. Stargate, which incorporated earlier this year, has not invested in the site.

JPMorgan has provided the bulk of the debt financing across two loans totalling $9.6bn, according to people close to the matter, including a $7.1bn loan announced this week. Crusoe and Blue Owl have separately invested around $5bn in cash.

Once completed, its scale will rival plans by Elon Musk to expand his “Colossus” data centre in Memphis, Tennessee, to house around 1mn Nvidia chips. Much of the data centre has so far been built on Nvidia’s earlier H100 and H200 chips, which are less powerful.",4009,True,1748024146.0,2025-05-23 20:15:46,330,45,callsonreddit,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ktqju3/oracle_to_buy_40bn_of_nvidia_chips_for_openais/,True,0.97,2025,elon,hot,False,False,0,

You can run shorter but frequent trains in less less busy lines. 

You can attach or seperate 2 trams according to the demand.

Also metro trains have less occupancy during night times and middays when there are a lot more clean energy being curtailed. Take for example Newyork subway. During night times there are a lot more wind and nuclear energy. So you are using energy that would otherwise go to waste.

Energy efficiency is not the only thing you should cars about. Space efficiency is another thing. A bus only needs 2 passengers to be more space efficient than a car. 

You need a lots of road surface constructed for cars. It emits 10,605.2 ton per lane kilometer of road. Asphalt is very carbon intensive and it's made from oil.

And then a car has an average occupancy of 1.5 per car. It's even lower for urban roads. Only 1.2 per car.

And you didn't count how much CO2 would be emttied to make a car. How much energy needed to produce a car. A car uses a lots of aluminum, steel and plastic.

A 12 meter electric bus consumes 1 kWh per km. With 12 people per bus it would only be 78.8 Wh/km. Also don't forget 84% of UK population lives in England. And 13.5% of UK population lives in London.

Also you need much less resources if everyone used buses. Take for example Shenzen which has a 100% electric bus fleet. There are only one bus per 800 people.  You would need atleast 1 car per 4 people if everyone used cars. Let's see how much battery you would need for people using cars vs buses. An electric bus has a battery of 350 kWh at most. They can have much less battery with pantograph charging in terminals. Even if we assumed 350 kWh it's only 437.5 Wh per person. Electric car on the other hand would need 15,000 Wh/person or even more like 60,000 Wh/person. 

Also there's a reason you are not talking about trains here. All you talk about is buses. A highspeed train travelling at 300 kmph (187.5 mph) only consumes only 30 Wh/passenger km.

post,1ku94ha,,Trying to Learn – How Do You Short Tesla Smarter?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve taken a few shots at shorting TSLA recently—some decent reads, but I keep getting caught by timing issues or stop-losses. One example: a few days ago I set my sell order at $355, but the stock topped out at $354.99 and never triggered. Then it dropped hard, and I missed the trade completely.

I currently hold small positions in Alphabet-C, Apple, Nvidia, gold, and REITs—so I’m mostly flat now and just watching the market.

Looking to learn and improve.

1. What strategies or indicators do you use when shorting Tesla?

2. How do you avoid getting stop-hunted or missing entries by a few cents?

3. Any good risk-management habits I should adopt?

comment,1ku94ha,1ku94ha,,"Shorting TSLA has been my best investment ever. Here are my tricks.


1) Don't literally short it. Buy ETFs like TSLS, TSLZ, and TSLQ. I prefer the 1x ETFs unless I have extremely high conviction. 


2) Be patient. Really patient. Wait for it to hit overbought areas on the RSI. Don't chase bad days.


3) Take your gains. TSLA always throws out some bullshit eventually so if you are up a decent amount on the day or week just take the win. Do not hold long.


4) Watch the news. Pay attention to macro and micro things that impact the market. If there is an overall bull sentiment, TSLA will go up. Don't fight it. Just wait for it to get overbought. Understand when TSLA sales numbers come out, and when earnings are coming up.


5) Never hold through earnings. At least not your full position. You can trade during ER but don't hold through. TSLA usually sells off slowly ahead of earnings and bad news gets ""priced in"". That's why it bounces back.


6) Pretend like TSLA is in fact a $400 or $500 stock and ignore logic. Everything will make more sense. If it sells off to $200 it will seem like it can go lower (it might), but make your decisions assuming the dumbest and most corrupt rich people in the world think it's a $500 stock.


7) Learn about and follow options max pain. Google it. Tesla options are heavily traded.

BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) -Nvidia will launch a new artificial intelligence chipset for China at a significantly lower price than its recently restricted H20 model and plans to start mass production as early as June, sources familiar with the matter said.

The GPU or graphics processing unit will be part of Nvidia's latest generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors and is expected to be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, well below the $10,000-$12,000 the H20 sold for, according to two of the sources.

The lower price reflects its weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements.

It will be based on Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a server-class graphics processor and will use conventional GDDR7 memory instead of more advanced high bandwidth memory, the two sources said.

They added it would not use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's advanced Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology.

The new chip's price, specifications and production timing have not previously been reported.

The three sources Reuters spoke to for this article declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to media.

An Nvidia spokesperson said the company was still evaluating its ""limited"" options. ""Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China's $50 billion data center market.""

TSMC declined to comment.

post,1kum63j,,How bad can it get when crypto goes POOF?,"Right now there is about 3 trillion market cap in crypto, which is making a lot of people feel significantly richer than they are. supposing crypto market cap goes to near zero, I do not think there has ever been a wealth destruction event like that ever in the history of markets. I think it could have significant impacts on the global economy, causing a very real financial crisis.

AI is probably in a bubble as well, there are very obvious stocks at the very least which are beyond reason, such as tesla and Palantir.

These seem to be a staple in the modern portfolio, and could contribute to an even greater loss of the wealth effect.

the wealth effect would further deteriorate as multiple compression occurs across the board in a bear market.

A lot of people will probably pile on here saying that crypto wont go to zero, but factually there is only one use for blockchain technology right now and that would be a CBDC. CBDC would not have anything to do with the current coins which are being treated as ponzi schemes, and would not be related to the likes of tether or USDC. As matter of fact tether and USDC would likely stop existing as liquidity for them would dry up in an event where there is no coins to gamble on outside of them.

Is the next great financial crisis going to play out something like this? and when will it occur? Historically in great bubbles they were nearing an end when political figures were stoking the fire for personal gain. It is not hard to see this playing out right now. A lot of people find comfort that there is greater acceptance of crypto, but in fact it is a sign that the party is nearing its end. History rhymes.

EDIT: I have responded a lot in here, I think that I have clarified a few things with people and would like to change my wording above.

A significant majority of the democratic subset won’t buy Tesla while Musk is still involved. A minority of that group, however, will still buy if the car is good and it makes sense economically. 

Republicans aren’t a very EV-friendly group but I suspect those who will buy an EV will look at Tesla very favorably considering Musk’s massive investments in getting Republicans elected. 

The dgaf politically group will buy whatever car makes sense for them. There might be a small % that will hesitate due to the whole “Roman” salute situation but it’s likely a very small subset since the mainstream media basically shrugged it off.

**Key Takeaways**

* Nvidia's scheduled earnings Wednesday highlight the tech financial reports calendar this week, along with quarterly updates from Salesforce, Marvell Technologies, Dell, and HP. Other noteworthy reports expected include retailers Costco, AutoZone, and Dick’s Sporting Goods.
* Friday’s PCE inflation report will provide insight into price pressure in April, while investors will also be following updates to first-quarter GDP, the U.S. trade balance, and consumer confidence.
* Federal Reserve officials set to speak this week include Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller and New York Fed President John Williams, coming as the Fed is scheduled to release the minutes from its May meeting.

Nvidia (NVDA) earnings and a key inflation report highlight this week’s holiday-shortened calendar as investors continue to evaluate the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and economic policies.

Tech companies Salesforce (CRM), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Dell Technologies (DELL), and HP (HPQ) are expected to deliver earnings this week. Market watchers will also be looking for reports from retailers Costco Wholesale (COST), AutoZone (AZO), Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS), and Temu parent PDD Holdings (PDD).

The reports are set to arrive after a down week for stocks, which was punctuated Friday by a revival of trade-related uncertainty. You can recap last week's trading here.

In addition to Friday's personal consumption expenditures inflation report on Friday, investors will also be tuned into first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) updates and the latest data on the U.S. trade balance and retail inventories. Consumer confidence and sentiment surveys also will be in focus.

Several Fed officials are on the speaking calendar, including Federal Reserve Gov.",7347,True,1748178984.0,2025-05-25 15:16:24,70,4,callsonreddit,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kv2as8/what_to_expect_in_the_markets_this_week_may_2730/,True,0.92,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kv2htl,,Elon says he's back to work 24/7; bullish on TSLA,"So obviously after Elon hurt his reputation/brand after extremely unpopular political activities, it took a major outage at X dot com to result in this:

> “Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms,” Musk wrote in a post on X on Saturday replying to news of outages on the platform. “I must be super focused on X/xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.”

For me this is extremely bullish as his involvement with TSLA was the main driver for its success & stock price. 

Having Elon back to work at Tesla is going to get those products out the door, especially robi taxi & those dancing robots.. I know it sounds comical but I see 100s of millions of people buying these robots.

post,1kv8qph,,FSD Lane Changing makes me rage !!!,"I subscribed to FSD a week ago and while it’s kinda cool, I cannot deal with the constant lane changing. I’m in chill mode and have all the settings enabled that are supposed to make minimal lane changes, yet every drive the car is constantly going from a wide open fast last into slower middle lanes. There will be no cars in front of me yet it constantly tries to switch lanes and nearly cut people off and it makes no sense because my exit won’t be for 5-10 miles+. I disable the FSD when it tries to switch lanes, and a minute or two later as soon as I turn it back on, it instantly tries switching lanes again with no cars in front of me yet so many vehicles in the lanes it tries to change to. This might be the most frustrating thing, but I also hate that I can’t use my screen for more than 5 seconds without getting a warning to pay attention. Don’t really see the point of FSD if I basically have to sit like a statue and constantly nudge the steering wheel. How am I supposed to mess with my climate or music or navigation? Even if I look around to double check I’m not cutting someone off, I get a warning.

post,1kvbg6e,,Latest FSD update surprised me,"So, today I used FSD for the first time after the last update either yesterday or the day before.  I noticed there is a new feature: Start FSD from Park.  I’m pretty sure that’s new.  I was at our local Tractor Supply when I decided to try it out.  Clicked on the button, pressed on the brake and we got started.  My MY navigated through the parking lot and instead of turning left as it always does, it turned right (south) onto Rt 10.  Not one to argue I let her do her thing.  I found myself driving scenic local roads instead of jumping right onto Rt 30 bypass which is the usual our MY goes.  It was winding and a lot of fun.  Couple of Amish buggies as usual, no problem going around them. Here’s the major surprise.  Unlike a few days ago, the MY not only correctly identified our driveway, it smoothly without stopping turned into our 300+ foot long winding driveway and brought the vehicle to our front parking area right next to the front door!  Usually there is a few places where there’s confusion when approaching our home, often it tried to pull in to our neighbor’s driveway if left to its own devices.  Previously, even when I tried to get her to go up our driveway under FSD it would often mistake a gravel parking area and turn into it half of the time.  The smoothness of ride absolutely felt like I was in an UBER from pickup to drop off.  I was not expecting that.

I'm biased, but I see new C3 footage, I post. TFLclassics has a very base spec early C3, which is an interesting car to look at. It only has a 327ci V8 rated at 300hp gross, mated to a 3-speed manual, which probably gives it acceleration figures comparable to the later gas crisis cars. That being said, definitely still a fun car to cruise around in, and the input points are very positive in these old C3s. Throttle response, shift-feel, steering, braking, etc. actually feel really good in good condition cars. It reminds me of my reaction the first time I used the brakes on my '80. It felt so positive, like it was happy to stop you at any speed... up until the low traction of the crappy BFG radial T/As locked up.

post,1kvcs9x,,TSLA vs. BYDDY – Which EV Stock Is the Better Bet Right Now?,"Let’s keep it real  Tesla’s got the hype, but BYD is quietly crushing it

Yeah, Tesla’s talking a big game with Full Self-Driving, robotaxis, and household robots. Cool stuff, but it's all *future*. Meanwhile, their core EV business? Slipping. Q1 deliveries were the worst in over two years (337k), and they’re losing global market share. Stock's riding on promises

Then there’s BYD. Not as flashy, but they’re dominating China 34% of the NEV market in 2024, $107B in revenue (more than Tesla!), and some insane charging tech (250 miles in 5 minutes?!). Plus, their cars are affordable. Under $10K for an EV? That’s game-changing

Sure, BYD isn’t as far along with FSD, but they’re investing $14B into making smarter cars. And the stock’s trading at a sane valuation (under 27x earnings). Tesla? Still moon-high

Bottom line: If you’re betting on wild future tech, TSLA might be your pick.

Hey folks, I need some help.  I have searched the Model 3 Service Manual, the EPC, Reddit, and ChatGPT for the name of the part in the picture.  I know the general term is brightwork, and there is plenty of documentation for the upper brightwork piece but not the piece indicated in the picture.

Why do I need to know?  I had an authorized Xpel t.i.n.t installer put t.i.n.t on my ‘21 Model 3, and when I got home I realized that the part in the picture was hitting/rubbing against the similar piece on the front of the LH back door.  It was not doing that prior to the install, so I want to be able to speak intelligently about the issue when I call them on Tuesday.  Not only that, I think it has to be in the Service Manual and/or EPC.

UWB is more accurate, shorter range, and more secure than Bluetooth. It also gave features such as auto boot (trunk) etc. 

Generally their app development teams tend to release updates for iOS before Android.

Another big one is Tesla is natively integrated with shortcuts on iOS so you can set up shortcuts and automations with Tesla from an iPhone, whilst I believe it’s only possible on Android via paid 3rd party apps where you not only have to pay monthly, but also trust the app enough to log into it with your Tesla account.

First is all v1 and v2 150kw Superchargers. They only charge Teslas.

Next are v3 and v4 250kw Superchargers. These can charge non-Teslas if you have an adapter and Tesla's permission. Jeep does not right now.

The final class are v4 supercharger with an embedded adapter. Any EV can use these.

The final group is the only one that you can use.

The charging universe is not only Tesla. EVGo and electrify America have been on the scene for awhile. Lately I've been using Rivian Adventure Network chargers. Start with a tap of a credit card and super fast.

Just look for other chargers too is my advice. Use plugshare.com to search for chargers in the area where you are going.

post,1kw2152,,"Data after 50,000+ miles across a Bolt EUV and a Tesla Model 3","I have a separate meter for my 2023 Tesla Model 3 RWD that I use to track energy use, efficiency, cost (and cost-savings), etc., and compare back to very detailed data I kept on my previous ICE car. 

Given I've now driven >30,000 miles, it felt like a good time to share the data and because I had it, I also shared comparisons to the Bolt EUV. 

|Measure|2023 Tesla Model 3 RWD|2022 Bolt EUV FWD|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Miles**|30,499|19,912|
|**Total kWh**|9,028|6,547|
|**Wh/Mi; Mi/kWh; MPGe**|296; 3.38; 114|329; 3.04; 103|
|**Average Temp**|49F|52F|
|**Savings ; Tax**\*\*\*|$2,076.44; $437.37|$1,454.89; $279.50|

**SAVINGS**  
*\*I benchmarked the fuel costs associated against my prior car, a Toyota Corolla which got 33.17 mpg over the 100,000+ miles I tracked it, and I also benchmarked against current gas prices, which in my area have been roughly $3/gallon but I am using nuanced* [*monthly averages for my state*](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM_EPMRU_PTE_NUS_DPG&f=W)*. I also bake in a $30 oil change per 5,000 miles as ""fuel"".* 

*\*\*I also calculated the portion of my savings that is due to taxes I'm not paying at the pump (0.285+0.184 per gallon) - which is relevant politically given we can expect a $250/year EV surcharge to attempt to ""close that loophole"", which for me, looks to be ""fair"" if it were state + federal, but just being federal and* combine*d with my state's surcharge ($75), it is not.* 

I have insurance, tabs, depreciation, maintenance, as well but wanted to focus on ""fuel"". Those costs are all higher than the Corolla due to the Tesla (and Bolt) being much newer cars (and fully insured instead of minimally insured) and the heightened costs do offset the fuel-savings for now. I'll be curious to see over 100,000+ miles how the total cost to own tightens up and I expect the Tesla to win out.

I plan on getting a model s 2022LR this coming fall from Tesla or a local dealership and then eventually a model x and I am by no means a speed performance guy or really care about the looks of the rims. That’s why Idgaf about the plaid trims

Trying to find some rims and wheels not breaking the bank/or atleast are reasonably priced but provide the best efficiency but also provide the rim protection or at least overlap to help prevent cracking the rim or road rash. Pros and cons to the sizing of wheels are appreciated too, but I’d imaging I’m pretty onset for 19” for the model s. 

(I’ll go to a model x refresh once it drops down to high 30’s/low 40’s hopefully) 
With this it’ll be my daily driver, but once we move this model s will go to my fiancée and she is sometimes a curb monster and I don’t want to have to worry about it. 

Anyone got any recommendations? 
Model s and x references are appreciated! 
Thank you! 
I don’t know much about tires and rims for EV’s or ICE to be honest, so I hope I’m not poking the beast.

I'm not sure if you're asking about aftermarket wheels? But cheapest option would be to just go with the wheels Tesla provides. You can get cheap aftermarket rim guard things if you are really worried about curb rash.

But the type of tire doesn't matter for your purposes, I'd recommend looking for a Model S that comes with the 19"" wheels, those wheels a) have plastic covers that actually go over the wheels, they're easily replaceable so no need to worry about curb rash and b) have lots of affordable tires that can be slightly oversized from the factory tires.  Example, the 19s are OEM size 255/45/19 in the front. When I bought my car I got winter tires that were sized 265/45/19 (fronts), this was a little wider and gave PLENTY of protection of the rim.

All in all, if I were you, I just would stick with the factory wheels, put aside ~$500 for wheel rash repair, and stick with factory tire sizes.

While everyone's freaking out about the 53% EPS drop, I've been trying to make sense of why the stock is still up 37% over the same period. Either I'm missing something or the market is.

My position: 120 shares @ $187 average (up about 81% total)

The Q1 earnings were objectively bad

EPS of $0.27 vs expected $0.41 (missed by 34%)

Factory changeovers for Model Y killed production numbers

Automotive margins down to 19% from previous highs in the mid-20s

Musk sounding increasingly distracted on the call

Yet I'm still holding and even added 15 shares on the post-earnings dip. Here's why:

The energy business is quietly becoming a monster

While everyone obsesses over car deliveries, Tesla's energy storage business hit record gross profit with 26% margins. My brother works in commercial solar, and he says Megapack orders are backlogged for months. The margins here are substantially better than automotive, and it's growing faster.

I was skeptical about the robotaxi timeline until I saw the Austin test videos. If they actually launch paid rides next month as planned, it changes everything about the valuation model. Even if it's limited geographically, proving the technology works would be massive.

Tesla is like the iPhone. When it came out, a lot of people wanted buttons again. So a lot of people would not leave Blackberry or they would get a Gen 1 Android phone ie the HTC G1.

post,1kwrt8l,,New 3-row EV comparison,"Below is the summary by Google NotebookLM

* **Kia EV9**
   * **Price:** Starts at $54,900, or basically $55,000, making it the cheapest and best value vehicle in the three-row segment. The as-tested price of the specific model shown was just over $70,000, around $72,000. You can get the Land trim with a large battery pack and dual motor for this price. Leasing is also mentioned as very cheap, around $299 per month with about $2500 down (taxes included in Colorado).
   * **Range:** The video mentions the EPA rated range is put up. The large battery pack is almost 100 kilowatt hours. The range is described as ""not all that much,"" just under 100 kilowatt hours, but considered an ""easy justification"" for the price.
   * **Charging Performance:** Charging performance is noted as being good due to its EGMP platform. The peak charging speed is about 220 kW briefly, but most of the time it's about 200 kW, and it holds this speed deep into the pack, sitting at just about 200 kW up to 80%. This makes it an amazing charging vehicle for road trips. However, it's the only vehicle in the comparison that doesn't natively interface well with the Tesla Supercharger network, getting a maximum of 84 kW currently, though this is expected to increase to 125 kW for model year 2026. It uses an onboard booster for Supercharging and can be buggy.
* **Cadillac Vistic**
   * **Price:** Described as ""quite a bit more money than the Kia,"" starting around $80,000 base, with the as-tested model around $84,000. Higher trims can go up to $100,000.
   * **Range:** Shares the Lyric battery, which GM quotes as 102 kilowatt hours capacity, though it's closer to 105-106 kWh. The battery capacity is only about 10 to 20 kWh more than the smaller Equinox and Optic, which feels like a lot of money for the battery size in a large car. The range is mentioned as being one of the ""big oversightes"".",5740,True,1748363523.0,2025-05-27 18:32:03,152,218,yangqi,electricvehicles,https://youtu.be/METibmN_xPg?si=XMI_sjIgauUCbomJ,False,0.8,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kwu39i,,Configuration question,"Hi everyone — quick question for anyone familiar with Tesla’s VIN assignment process.

I originally ordered a 2026 Model Y with AWD, then later changed my configuration to the RWD version after it was released. My account reflects the updated pricing and specs for RWD.

However, I was recently assigned a vehicle that (based on public lookup tools) may correspond to an AWD build. I’m wondering if this has happened to anyone else — maybe during a config change or transition period?

Did the issue eventually get corrected? Or did you receive the different drivetrain?

Appreciate any insight!

Have insurance companies, contrarian bets, mix of mid cap growth companies which have proven themselves with continuously strong earnings reports, and few crazy growth stories.

**The Rules**: DCA daily, when fear and greed index dumps below 25 then aggressively DCA even lump sum. If a company has more than 2 bad earnings more-so guidance than they're out.

**Good Time To Buy?**: I believe they're all overpriced right now. Will hedge with UVXY calls buying monthlies, selling against the position creating diagonals at various strikes when there's an upcoming binary event which could be negative catalyst.

comment,1kwulr6,1kwulr6,,"People are giving you incomplete answers here.

What you noticed probably isn't magic or a placebo.

On Teslas, if the alignment data is reset in the service menu, the car ""forgets"" where the center point of the alignment ""actually physically is"", and sets back to 0 degrees relative to the steering column. Over the next 5, 10, 20, 50 miles, the car keeps track of the position of the steering wheel when the car is driving straight and applies an offset to the value, which adjusts where the car sees it's home/base steering position value. This affects the pull of the steering wheel. This is so that if the steering wheel is off by 1 or 2 degrees, the car won't forever ""pull"" to straighten the wheel out. It'll learn exactly what position the steering wheel must be in for the car to go perfectly straight, and will pull toward that position.

Let's say your tesla had a learned steering offset of -2 degrees. You might not even realize. Car drives perfectly straight with no pull left or right. Then you hit a pothole and bend something or mess something up, and now the ""real center point"" of the steering in order to go down the road straight is more like PLUS 2 degrees instead of minus 2 degrees. The steering wheel is going to be pulling to one side when you let go of the wheel. If somebody went in and RESET that learned steering offset value, now it's back to ""0"" and the steering wheel is going to be pulling to that side HALF as badly.",2459,True,1748371059.0,2025-05-27 20:37:39,22,0,Douche_Baguette,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kwulr6/could_my_tesla_have_fixed_its_own_alignment/muk8kje/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,muk8kje

post,1kwx3a7,,Headrest Question,"
Hi everyone,

I noticed yesterday that my passenger headrest in my 2021 Model Y. From my research, this appears to be a common issue.

I sent in a service request and received an invoice for $205. Looking on third-party sites, I can find OEM headrests for ~$50 and can easily replace it myself. However, this OEM number is 1623801-00-A. The OEM part for the headrest that Tesla quoted me was 1623798-91-C.

Again doing research, I cannot find much difference between these OEM parts. Both appear to fit my 2021 MY. It appears the Tesla quoted OEM would include abilities for “special features”? I am not sure what special features would be included in my headrest. 

Would anyone be able to guide me in the right direction here?",729,False,1748375823.0,2025-05-27 21:57:03,1,7,ImmediateMajor4337,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwx3a7,False,0.6,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kx07eb,,FSD AI halucinating / lying just like regular AI?," I have an exit I prefer to use that is one prior to the direct exit due to that street having lots of pot holes and construction. I have tried and can not permanently edit the route.  When I am on the freeway maybe 10 miles out I will edit the route and select the other route with the exit prior.  Often when I hit accept the map refreshes and then reverts to the original exit so that I have to click the change again.

Since the last update it will accept the change right away and reflect it on the map and also in the turn by turn direction.  The car will start moving to the exit lane and then pass the exit and take the one it wanted in the first place. This morning it passed the exit again and then turned on the signal and wanted to take the emergency lane on the overpass thinking it could still get off.

It will also do this when I get home.  I re-route, it accepts and confirms and I can see the change on the map then it will wait too long to merge and take the next street anyways (the street it initally said it would take)

  
I get the feeling they system will do what I want after asking a few times just to shut me up (such as putting on the signal multiple times before it decides to change lanes) and then just does what it originally wanted anyways.

Now I do notice that I have the cameras active 90% of the drive and once I get to this part of the freeway I have been loosing my cabin camera monitoring and get the streeting wheel nag.  I also sometimes get a buffer on my apple music. I am wondering if this is due to a lack of connectivity in the area?

post,1kx0z93,,Exploring FSD is fun!,"Carrying in on my exploration of the latest FSD release, we got a call from Applebee’s.  My wife left her phone at the restaurant.  I immediately volunteered to retrieve the pink princess phone. My motives weren’t pure of course, I just wanted an excuse to try out FSD again.  I’m sure my OCD ‘drove’ me to this.  From the garage I launched FSD with the parking option.  Maggie (my model Y’s name ‘cause her license plate starts with MGY) obediently backed up, did a 3 corner turn and moved onto the road.  She navigated the entire 4 miles on local roads without fuss including a bridge out (common here in Pennsylvania) and not only got me into Applebees parking lot but pulled straight in to a parking spot.  That flustered me because I thought for sure she’d back in.  Oh well.  I retrieved the errant iPhone and started the voyage back home with FSD from the parking spot.  As I approached a critical intersection that normally goes straight she indicated a turn.  I thought “that’s not right” and overrode and went straight.  Shortly after that I got stuck in a 1/2 mile backup on a two lane road.  After 10 minutes of listening to Audible I decided to turn around and try another path home.  As soon as I made the U-turn I turned over driving to Maggie.  Soon I was back on track (I waved to others stuck in the jam whilst driving to make their own getaway) and Maggie did her magic.  I was back on track enjoying the Audible book (Bobiverse book 3).  From that point on she got me home through a couple more nasties and, yay, she turned into our driveway right up to the house.  Not quite pulling into the garage but close enough.  Damn, I’m REALLY loving this!  Let me know if I’m being way over the top with this experience or if you want me to post more like this.

post,1kx17ua,,Seat position discrepancy between 2026 and 2021(or older versions) Model Y - Anyone else noticing this?,"I recently upgraded from a 2021 Model Y to a 2026 Model Y, and I've noticed something odd when syncing my profile between the two vehicles. When I save my seat position in the 2026 Model Y and then use the same profile in my 2021 Model Y, the seat position in the older model ends up much farther back (the recline) than it is in the new model. 
Has anyone else who has upgraded to a 2026 Model Y while keeping their older Model Y experienced this? I'm wondering if it's due to differences in the seat design or the reclining mechanism between the two. The steering wheel position seems to sync just fine, but the seat position, particularly the recline, feels off way off, this is vice versa because if I change the position in the 2021 it's much closer position to the steering wheel in the 2026.

He literally said “get onboard with Tesla, it’s a technology company with an amazing Optimus robot product”; and then “Apple will make the best AI technology”.

Doesn’t mean I won’t criticize him, but I do so on things that are real not hoax-based.

He’s definitely been showing his ass a lot more within the past year.  His shilling for Musk and Trump is pathetic.  He’s proven many times over the years he knows better, so the current views are an appeal to cult populism.

The biggest lie abiut him is regarding his returns.  On Wall Street, his performance was legitimately excellent.  He averaged something like 24-27% *after* fees, for over 15 years.  That doesn’t happen by luck.  His major calls since retiring would have made you an 8 figure millionaire.  That’s possibly why he spews such overconfidence in things like TSLA and AAPL.  Put simply, they’ve been major multi-bagger successful stories for him, so from his perspective, why not?

He’s a genius in multiple subject areas which is probably what made him a narcissist.  One such area is market whispering, and that has helped his results through some legendary “sell all” calls in which he’s kept his portfolios from getting whacked down to the average.  

He’s made many big and powerful enemies, and they’re the source of 98% of the criticism you’ve absorbed.

post,1kx4kb9,,Model 3 HW4 FSD Software Crashes and AP Critical Alerts. Any experience or advice?,"I wanted to get some input from you guys related to an issue I've been having with my 2024 Model 3 to see if anyone else has experienced my issue and if so, what did Tesla do to resolve it:

  
Over the past several months, I've had an intermittent issue where I'll be using FSD and the car will start alarming and saying to take over immediately followed by ""Autopilot aborted due to system error"". It then takes 5 or so minutes for it to come back online. At first, I brushed it off as a bug in the software, but it became more frequent and recently went as far as braking to a stop and putting itself in park in the middle of a highway.

  
What's odd is that after it does its reboot, there are no lingering user facing errors or notifications to get the vehicle serviced. In service mode the main alert showing up is APS\_w159\_apbCritical which states ""*Autopilot Processor Secondary (APS) detects that the Autopilot Processor Backup (APB) is not functioning as expected, making Autopilot (AP) features unavailable.""* 

  
I've already made a service appointment, but the Tesla service technician seemed to be dismissive of there being a real problem and scheduled me pretty far out. My concern is that this seems to keep happening on multiple software versions and does not seem to be a common error other drivers are reporting. The most info I can find seems to revolve around the 2024 holiday update bricking model 3s built in the same month mine was, but I had no issue with the update and my car does not completely loose FSD/AP after rebooting like other cars did.

  
If anyone can give any anecdotal experience with a similar issue and/or advice on handling the service appointment, I'd greatly appreciate it!",1723,False,1748395389.0,2025-05-28 03:23:09,1,3,Isotopicgoose,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kx4kb9/model_3_hw4_fsd_software_crashes_and_ap_critical/,True,0.6,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

comment,1kx4q6n,1kx4q6n,,"* For Texas, you may want to consider tint or a sunshade. I went with tint.
* Yes, the warranty still applies for used through 3rd party. I purchased a used 2023 through the tesla site and received an additional warranty.
* I had to rotate the tires but they were in good shape for 21k miles. I recommend low mileage if it’s in your budget. Long range used tend to have lots of miles. I wanted one but the standard range is doing just fine. I also had to change the filters. The car needs new wipers. That’s it for maintenance. My car had a crack in the sunroof that I missed during delivery. Fortunately Tesla replaced it free.
* I had FSD free for 30 days loved it. It comes with a subscription for all Tesla’s at $99/month plus tax. You can purchase through the car or app. You may also wantbto subscribe to the premium connectivity for internet service it was cheaper to subscribe to a one year term for like $100.
* Do a thorough walk through. Make a list or find one online.
* If this is your first EV consider the costs for charger installation Nema or wall charger. Will the car come with a mobile charger? Mine did not so I paid like $300 for mobile and $515 for wall charger plus install.
* Try to get the $4k tax credit if you can. Tesla offers it at point of sale and so does Carvana.

comment,1kx4imk,1kx4imk,,"It’s good to look at miles a few times a year to see what a full charge in miles is, as far as a quick battery degradation look. 

This is my first EV and during my research 90% of Tesla owners recommended percentage (seems to be consistent with the comments here). That’s what I’m using however it did take some getting used to. 

*Tip: while learning your vehicle, take it on a trip and see how the percentage/mileage changes as you accelerate. Be sure to use GPS. Then try to get to a steady speed and see how consistent it becomes. The percentage/mileage for your trip will become more accurate and you will know that the change/accuracy for the GPS is in your control. Not much different than any other car. Higher RPM’s means you’re buring more gas/mile. The Tesla doesn’t exactly have this gauge, at least not in my model 3.

comment,1kx5c3a,1kx5c3a,,">""In China, we see intense competition and Tesla is no longer seen as the technology leader.""

I think this is the real kicker here. 

While the sales decline worldwide (especially in the US) has *some* to do with Elon's salute and his time at Doge,  I think other factors have contributed much more to it. Tesla's sales have been shrinking for the past two years.

A very limited and aging lineup, 3/5 of which are out of the reach of the average person has played a big role. More people want SUVs over sedans, so Tesla is effectively competing with just one model. I don't think the refresh was significant enough for people to want to upgrade.

I too believe that nobody thinks of them as the technology leader anymore which is why the competition has been able to gain a foothold. 

Their tech is still better than the competition in North America in the sense that everything just works and works seamlessly, lag free, but I don't think that's gonna cut it anymore. Model Y is still the highest selling EV in most places but I doubt it'll be for long.",1057,False,1748402118.0,2025-05-28 05:15:18,33,0,ChickenFlavoredCake,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kx5c3a/byd_xiaomi_overtake_tesla_as_top_ev_brand_choices/mumxrsr/,True,,2025,both,hot,False,False,0,mumxrsr

The true competitors are Xpeng, zeekr , Nio and Li auto (and  xiaomi and huawei). The reality is that those companies offer something different or more compared to tesla.

comment,1kx7hp9,1kx7hp9,,"This is true.  I just did the used card EV credit.  Here is what you need.
1. Car cannot be more than $25000, not counting tax, title and license (all that other crap counts towards the $25000 limit)
2. Your taxable income for the year you are applying for (you can retro apply it to last year) can't be more than $75000 ($150,000 joint).
3. Car has to be only one previous owner. (Ask the dealer for the carmax report...it will tell you if it is only 1-owner or not)
4. The model of the used EV must be 2 years or more older than the current model out.
5. Also must be from a dealer, not a personal sale (not 100% sure on this part)...because the dealer has to register with the IRS in order to give you credit for the used EV.   As a matter of fact, when I bought it, the dealer did the paperwork for me, sent it in and gave me the credit in about 2 weeks and released the car to me.  Didn't need to wait to wait for a refund to get it back.

SOunds like a lot, but it's worth saving $4000

Also if you can swing it, you can get some great deals on 2023  Model 3 for right at $25000, with very low mileage and still have warranty on it.  I got a 2023 Model 3 at $21000 after the credit.  Had 25K miles on it and still had a year of warranty left.

post,1kxf90a,,Suggestion: enable/disable accessory power via App/API,"I love that we can now enable/disable accessory power through the vehicle. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like this is possible via the [vehicle commands API](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/endpoints/vehicle-commands#charge-max-range) or through the Tesla App itself. My use case: I have a battery-powered (independent of the vehicle HV/LV batteries) Dashcam that charges via the onboard 12V when I'm driving the car. 



Unfortunately, during long absences between driving / very short drives, I'm not able to charge the battery enough to get a reliable 12 - 14 hours of standby recording. I could leave the setting on permanently but this is wasteful and results in significantly higher idle-power usage. 



Ideally, I'd like a setting where I could have 12V power for 1-2 hours (enough to charge the battery, and then shutoff). Rivian has a feature like this and I've found it super helpful. It would also be cool to enable this as an API command and then use Tessie to trigger automations.



Why do I use an external dashcam? The optical quality of Blackvue dashcams is superior to Tesla's cameras and this has allowed me to capture license plate details where Tesla's built-in cameras have failed. I also like the fact that the front lens features a 136 degree wide horizontal capture angle, which allows me to get more of the road. I use a battery so that the dashcam can record even when the vehicle is off.",1428,False,1748433637.0,2025-05-28 14:00:37,5,4,JamMydar,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kxf90a/suggestion_enabledisable_accessory_power_via/,True,1.0,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

Parked and parallel parked itself. Could summon it over to us. I'm blown away!

You never know when incentives will change.  If you plan on financing a Model Y, the 1.99% APR deal is really amazing and is a huge discount people tend to not realize.  Plus all the extra referral discounts and everything, it's really hard to beat todays price on a Juniper.

But I suppose you are looking at a Model 3, so perhaps there will be another low APR deal on the highland.  Anyway, all I am saying is Tesla will KNOW the discount is going away, and they will advertise the crap out of the fact it no longer will exist, and likely discounts won't be quite as strong in Nov/Dec if I had to guess ...",956,False,1748449480.0,2025-05-28 18:24:40,2,0,abgtw,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kxi4rf/if_the_tax_credits_go_away_when_would_be_the_last/muq31u3/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,muq31u3

I was really excited about the ID Buzz but I’ve realized it’s a failure in the US. Tried to capture why I think it’s failing - can informed folks please weigh in. 

1. Price. The higher trims hit mid $70K and there are just fewer customers in this segment (irrespective of brand, range etc). 
2. Range. For a car starting mid $60Ks, a range of 230 miles is just not acceptable. It’s off by a 100 miles actually. 
3. No incentives. Since this isn’t made in the U.S. Also no special lease deals in the U.S.  
4. Minivans are just not popular, especially compared to SUVs. Doesn’t matter how novel it looks. 
5. Marketing. Unfortunately, there is almost no effective marketing campaigns to promote the vehicle.

May 12th I get this notification to pick up car in next 4 days or it will be cancelled

I tried to reach out to tesla about contradicting what they said on the phone but got ""as per order agreement"" to my face, no help

Upon checking the auto report the car is build and sold in sep 2020 without the wireless charhing, heat pump and other 2021 features, I felt betrayed and asked about it and they said it's standard procedure across the Industry, year doesn't mean you get the features - I was like but it says 2021 and I thought it will have the features, they said again ""as per order agreement""

Now I escalated this to used car manager and he says he put a mail to director is what he claims atleast and says got response from director and as per order agreement no refund no transfer if you don't take delivery it will be canceled. I said that is not fair please listen to call logs I gave them date and time too, again ""as per order agreement....

Now I do not know what to do
some friends suggest file bbb complaint or raise a dispute but I want to get a tesla and I will buy a tesla if not this car, so I do not want to be flagged from tesla for the bbb complaint or a chargeback

What option do I have now?

comment,1kxi4rf,1kxi4rf,,"You're right.

For people who want to see the details, subsection 112002(a) of the bill says:

        (a) In General.--Section 30D is amended--
                (1) by redesignating subsection (h) as subsection (i), and
                (2) in subsection (i), as so redesignated, by striking 
            ``December 31, 2032'' and inserting ``December 31, 2026''

This changes [26 USC Section 30D(h)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&edition=prelim&req=granuleid%3AUSC-2010-title26-section30D&num=0) to read:

>~~(h)~~ **(i)** Termination

>No credit shall be allowed under this section with respect to any vehicle placed in service after ~~December 31, 2032~~ **December 31, 2026**.

The next subsection of the bill goes on to say that for vehicles placed in service during 2026, there is a 200,000 vehicle cap. So, for Tesla, the substantive language can effectively be summarized as: ""No credit shall be allowed under this section with respect to any Tesla vehicle placed in service after December 31, 2025.""

We can then read [26 CFR Section 1.30D-2(b)(36)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-26/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-1/subject-group-ECFRcb39f040b41b74b/section-1.30D-2) for what ""placed in service"" means:

post,1kxrc5b,,"Leno's Law [35 year smog exemption in CA] has passed a major hurdle, but lost some of its teeth.","Around a month ago the 35 year smog exemption was placed in suspense while the appropriations committee spent more time on it. On Friday it successfully made it out of the appropriations committee, and should (hopefully) get a full vote by the CA senate.

But in the appropriations committee they made some modifications that make it somewhat less useful. The important part of the current amended text now reads:

***(c)  For purposes of subdivision (a), a collector motor vehicle, as defined in Section 259 of the Vehicle Code, is exempt from those portions of the test required by subdivision (f) of Section 44012 if the collector motor vehicle meets all of the following criteria:***

* ***(1) Submission of proof that the motor vehicle is insured as a collector motor vehicle, as shall be required by regulation of the bureau.***
* ***(2) The motor vehicle is at least 35 model years old.***
* ***(3) The motor vehicle complies with the exhaust emissions standards for that motor vehicle’s class and model year as prescribed by the department, and the motor vehicle passes a functional inspection of the fuel cap and a visual inspection for liquid fuel leaks.***

Both (1) and (3) represent a significant modification from the previous text. It looks like you'll have to submit some paperwork to do.

(3) Makes it unclear to me what actual benefit this bill will have if it gets passed. This gives the department (DMV) significant leeway to prescribe emissions standards that could really moot the whole point of the bill. We may not have a good idea what those will be until this is actually implemented, but I'm not overwhelmingly hopeful given the history of this kind of thing.

post,1kxsby5,,"Tesla targets June 12 launch for robotaxi service in Austin, Bloomberg News reports","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-targets-june-12-launch-204524186.html

(Reuters) -Tesla is poised to begin its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin on June 12, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The date has been discussed internally and could still change, the report added.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Earlier this month, CEO Elon Musk said the EV maker is set to begin a test of its long-promised robotaxi service on schedule in Austin, Texas, by the end of June.

A successful robotaxi trial is crucial for Tesla as Musk has shifted the company's focus away from building a new, cheaper EV platform to launching the robotaxi service and its Optimus humanoid robots. Much of Tesla's valuation hangs on that bet.

Tesla sales have fallen worldwide with rising competition and as Musk faces a backlash for his political views and his role as an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Let’s face it: the number of enthusiasts with cars whose model years are between 1976 and 1990, and who want an exemption, is low.

So what’s the goddamn harm in them getting an unlimited-mileage exemption on visual testing and creating an average emissions level for engine size, method of fueling, and aspiration? 

All 1.6-liter (1551cc through 1650cc) engines that are EFI and naturally aspirated have to meet the same standard. All 1.8-liter (1751cc through 1850cc) engines that are EFI and turbocharged have to meet the same standard. Cats are unlimited, but required.

post,1kxu7oq,,First-Time EV Buyer's Guide,"I often help people on the weekly General Questions and Purchasing Advice thread, and have been thinking about doing something like this to compile my answers to common questions. I'm going to structure it like a guide for each part of the buying process, but it's more like a collection of my thoughts. I'd be happy to add to it if anyone has anything else to contribute! This is also US-centric (sorry). 

#The Starting Line
So you want to buy an EV eh? Awesome! The process is, in general, very similar to buying a standard internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, but with a few key additional areas of research. I'm going to assume you generally know the basics of ICE vehicle ownership, and make this guide as specific as possible the electric portion of the vehicle purchasing. 

Let me say this up top though if you are on the fence for an EV. If you can charge at home and have a two-car (or more) household, you 100% should make one of those cars an EV. You'll save money on gas and oil changes, and experience the convenience of leaving home with a full ""tank"" every morning. You can get a used Chevy Bolt or Tesla for less than $10k almost anywhere in the US if you qualify for the $4k tax credit, and they're great vehicles that can completely cover 99% of driving needs (and obviously there's plenty of vehicles at higher prices). If that's all you need to hear, go for it. 

# Assess your situation
As always you should buy a car that suits your needs. Trucks for construction work, vans for families, etc. EVs are no different, but you should ask yourself a few additional questions to determine which, if any, EV is right for you: 

* The first, most important question - do you have a place to charge? The main benefit EV owners cite is that the vehicle can ""refuel"" at home, every night. In contrast, the ""worst"" part of the experience is public charging.",15761,True,1748470421.0,2025-05-29 00:13:41,85,53,chilidoggo,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kxu7oq/firsttime_ev_buyers_guide/,True,0.96,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

post,1kxwjdj,,Tesla investors demand Musk work 40-hour week at EV maker as ‘crisis’ builds,"Elon Musk needs to spend more time at Tesla as his electric vehicle company faces a “crisis,” according to a letter on Wednesday from a group of pension fund leaders who manage investments in the company.

“Tesla’s stock price volatility, declining sales, as well as disconcerting reports regarding the company’s human rights practices, and a plummeting global reputation are cause for serious concern,” the investors wrote in a letter to Robyn Denholm, the company’s board chair. “Moreover, many issues are linked to Mr. Musk’s actions outside of his role as Technoking and Chief Executive Officer at Tesla, including his high-profile role as an architect of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).”

The investors want the Tesla board to require Musk to work a minimum of 40 hours per week at the automaker as a condition of any new compensation plan they may arrange for him. They also want a clear succession plan for management of the EV business, and a policy that would apply to all Tesla directors limiting their outside board commitments at public and private companies.

Early last year, the Delaware Court of Chancery ordered Tesla to rescind Musk’s 2018 CEO pay package, which had been worth around $56 billion, finding that Musk controlled the company, and the board’s compensation committee misled shareholders before seeking their vote to approve the plan.

Musk now says he wants even more shares, amounting to 25% voting control of the company.

Tesla’s brand value and reputation have declined since 2024, due largely to Musk’s incendiary rhetoric and political activities. In addition to pouring nearly $300 million into an effort to get Donald Trump back into the White House, Musk formally endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party ahead of the country’s parliamentary election this year.

At DOGE, Musk has led an initiative by the Trump administration to slash federal agencies.",3951,True,1748476658.0,2025-05-29 01:57:38,316,51,Puginator,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kxwjdj/tesla_investors_demand_musk_work_40hour_week_at/,True,0.94,2025,both,hot,False,False,0,

comment,1kxxgm4,1kxxgm4,,"Let me get this straight:

* Your dad:
   * Intends to buy a used Tesla, 
   * Qualifies for the used EV tax credit,  
   * Wants to get the used EV tax credit, and
   * Does not qualify to get a loan to buy a Tesla.
* You and your brother:

Your question is, ""Will putting your name and your brother's name on the loan and (I presume) any title documents cause any problems with your dad getting the tax credit?"" 

Answer: probably not.  

As far as the IRS is concerned, it seems as though only the person the dealer reports to the IRS as the buyer needs to qualify for the used tax credit.  The IRS doesn't exactly say this, but here are the clues:

In [IRS FS-2024-26, page 4, A11](https://www.irs.gov/pub/taxpros/fs-2024-26.pdf#page=4), the IRS mentioned multiple people getting the *new* EV tax credit:

>The name and taxpayer identification number of the owner claiming the New Clean Vehicle Credit should be listed on the seller’s report. See Topic B, FAQ 9. Accordingly, multiple owners of a new clean vehicle should inform the seller which owner will claim the New Clean Vehicle Credit so that the seller can identify that taxpayer on the seller’s report. **The credit would be allowed only on the tax return of the owner listed in the seller’s report.",3559,True,1748482402.0,2025-05-29 03:33:22,3,0,SirMontego,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kxxgm4/cosign_on_used_ev_credit/mut2xr0/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mut2xr0

* Cons: Battery degradation unknown, no home charger (would supercharge every 2 weeks), depreciation, might be overkill if I sell in 2 years or bring it to NYC

# Option 2:  Used Mazda CX-5 (2017+, ~$17-20K)

* Pros: Stylish, reliable, gas is simpler than charging, more peace of mind than Tesla, good resale
* Cons: Still relatively pricey, not EV, higher fuel and maintenance costs than Tesla

# Option 3: 2015 Chevy Cruze (~$4K friend selling for cheap)

comment,1ky6ef5,1ky6ef5,,"Continuing our series on California EV sales in the first quarter, we’re now on to overall auto brand rankings. Why spend so much time on California? Well, if it was a country (and the rest of the US was still a country), it would be the 10th largest auto market in the world. Furthermore, it would rank even higher if we were focused on top EV markets. (Though, I don’t have that data on hand — perhaps a story for another day.)

  
Also, being the birthplace of Tesla and being a bastion of progressivism, it’s a fascinating market for examining Tesla sales trends. In fact, if we split the US up into states and combined European countries into one market (I know, now we’re getting weird), California would only trail China (\~135,000) and Europe (\~53,000) in Tesla sales.

Anyway, let’s get on to the trends. As you can see in the chart below, Tesla sales declined by about 7,000 units in the 1st quarter compared to the 1st quarter of 2024. With Honda climbing by about 5,000 sales (and Toyota climbing by about 5,000 sales), that actually meant that Tesla dropped from the second best selling auto brand in the Golden State to the third best selling auto brand in the Golden State.

post,1ky8r5u,,NY Times: Export Controls Are Endangering the Fragile U.S.-China Truce,"Just two-and-a-half weeks after agreeing to suspend tariffs, both countries are using export controls to disrupt each other’s key industries.

After stepping back this month from an escalating and dangerous war of tariffs, the United States and China are now threatening to undermine their uneasy truce.

On May 12, the countries announced after weekend meetings in Geneva that they would suspend most of their recently imposed tariffs. Since then, however, both governments have shown that they are still prepared to wield controls over critical exports as weapons against one another, with moves that are potentially even more damaging to trade and global supply chains.

China has restricted its exports of rare earth magnets, which are crucial for cars, semiconductors, aircraft and many other applications. Close to 90 percent of the world’s rare earth metals, including magnets, are produced in China.

And the United States on May 13 banned the latest semiconductors from Huawei, a Chinese electronics giant. Then on Wednesday, President Trump suspended the shipment of American semiconductors and some aerospace equipment needed for China’s commercial aircraft, the C919, a signature project in China’s push toward economic self-reliance.

The increasing use of export controls by both countries amounts to supply chain warfare, interrupting the flow of key components that the other country must have to operate huge industries that employ large numbers of workers.

Last week, Ford Motor temporarily closed a factory in Chicago that makes Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles after one of its suppliers ran out of the magnets. In most new cars, the magnets are used in dozens of electric motors that operate brake and steering systems, fuel injectors and even power seats.

comment,1kxu7oq,1kxu7oq,,"I do think we have to address the budget buyer use case too. The used market for EV is strong and getting stronger, as EV owners turn over to their 2nd (or 3rd) EV purchases. 

Used 1st(ish) generation EVs are getting quite affordable. Obviously check the model or brand specific subreddit for common issues, but a used EV is a great value, even with nominal battery degradation. 

As an example, I was shopping for a new commuter car and I wanted an EV. I wanted a small, efficient EV that didn’t look ridiculous. I also didn’t want to spend $25k - $50k for a new car that would depreciate as soon as I signed the paperwork. 

I didn’t need a lot of range, since it’s going back and forth to work and around town. Automated driving was a low priority, because I actually like to drive, though some enhanced safety features are fine. Similarly, have the ability to use DCFC in a pinch was good, but I didn’t need huge max DC speed. 

After looking at leafs, ford focus EVs, miniEVs, and others, I zeroed in on the e-Golf. The 2017-20 versions have DCFC and a “larger” battery that gets over 125mi in EPA and real-life driving in good weather. Some also have heat pumps for HVAC that help mitigate winter losses, though at the cost of a potential failure point.

At the end of the week (or more/less often depending on usage) I just drop the car off there and walk home. When it’s finished I walk over and pick it up.

It’s worked extremely well for me and it’s nice to get a short walk in the neighborhood. As such I’ve never supercharged except in road trips. It’s also a lot cheaper than supercharging.

For road trips I regularly travel out of state and it works extremely well. I prefer the ABRP app for routes though, as I think the car nav isn’t great for time optimization. It tries to minimize stops which causes you to waste time charging to 70-80%.",765,False,1748540812.0,2025-05-29 19:46:52,1,0,Argosy37,TeslaLounge,https://reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kyh35n/new_tesla_owner_with_questions_for_you/mux7gir/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,mux7gir

post,1kyhw50,,Trump Tariffs Blocked... But He Might Be Back Fast  Should We Be Pricing This In?,"Looks like Trump’s new round of tariffs just got shot down in court (IEEPA blocked), *but* he might not be out for long. Trade nerds say he can use Section 122 (Trade Act 1974) for a quick 150-day tariff blast within days, then follow up with slower but more permanent tariffs via Section 232 (nat’l security) or Section 301 (economic security, aka China stuff).

He did this in 2018–2020 and markets *did* react. Should we expect volatility this summer if he double taps with 122 → 301/232 again?

I have a 26 Juniper and 21 Bolt. Obviously, different connectors for charging with NACS and J1772. 

I moved recently and to have a new plug installed outside with my Grizzl-E’s NEMA 14-50 is not recommended without a GCFI breaker. I have decided to sell the Grizzl-E and purchase a Tesla wall connector. 

I regularly charge my Bolt at Superchargers with a A2Z EV CCS1 to NACS connector and also own a A2Z EV NACS to J1772 connector. 

Which way do you think I should go?

1. Tesla Wall Connector with NACS only and then use the A2Z adapter with the Bolt. 
2. Tesla Universal Wall Connector with NACS and J1772.

post,1kyl4rv,,Question about Tesla Cars,"Hello,

I’d like to start this off by saying that I have this problem where people keep hitting my car. Doesn’t matter if I’m stopped at a red light or just driving in my own lane. Somehow, people keep hitting me. I haven’t been at fault for any of these incidents so far. I’m pretty fed up with this because I’ve had my car for less than one year and it has been hit three times. I don’t even live in a big city. 

So, my question is: will a Tesla alert me if another car makes contact with mine, even if it’s just a really small bump? 

In one of the incidents I had, I was on a busy highway, stopped at a red light. I noticed the person behind me was super close to me but my car didn’t move and I didn’t hear a sound (my window was down) so I drove off. Later I checked and there was a dent in my car where the person hit me.

post,1kyld3i,,New vehicle purchase - check my gas/kWh math please,"TLDR: upgrading from a 35mpg (city) 2nd gen Prius to PHEV or EV, think either one will save us in the long run as gasoline costs increase here in California, but based on my math it is not looking feasible. I need some input if my math needs to account for other factors. 

For context, my wife has a 2007 Prius that's reliable but showing its age. Haven't done much highway driving lately but have been tracking the last few fuel purchases of mostly city driving and it seems to be getting about 35mpg lately. Regular 87 octane is holding at around $4/gallon. So approx 11.4 cents per mile for fuel only (not including maintenance, etc).
Central Valley CA. We are expected to see gas in the $6-8 range within the next 2 years due to refineries shutting down permanently, unless there is some course correction with the political winds.

Our goal in a new vehicle is to upgrade from what we currently have and have a vehicle that is good for long trips. We think PHEV is the ideal candidate. It would allow efficient daily commute use, but still have the engine and tank to take us anywhere on longer trips like we currently use her car or my truck (400-500 mile range) without having to deal with the range anxiety or charging times of a full EV. 

I'm learning to look past the MPGe number and look more closely at the specs, since MPGe is an average formula based on average driver use case scenario. 
Learning to ask: what is the MPG of the gas powertrain that will take us on longer trips, and what is the kWh/100 mile number.

Example a new Kia Sorento or Sportage PHEV have 31/34 miles of EV range respectively, and approx 34-36mpg gas, but a Mazda CX90 has 26 miles of battery range and only gets 26mpg gas. These are just a few PHEV models we have considered. 
Digging deeper, the kWh/100 mile ratings:
Kia Sportage PHEV 40
Kia Sorento PHEV 45
Mazda CX-90 PHEV 58

We do not currently have solar, it is in the future plans, so for now just paying straight PG&E rates on a tiered rate plan.",3710,True,1748550691.0,2025-05-29 22:31:31,4,58,keepcalmandcarryone,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kyld3i/new_vehicle_purchase_check_my_gaskwh_math_please/,True,0.64,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,
post,1kylja5,,"⚡ PSA: Can’t Adjust Your Tesla Wall Connector Settings Anymore? Here's How To Fix It (Gen 3, 2025 Method)","**TL;DR:**  
Tesla seems to have quietly killed the web setup process for Wall Connectors. If you're stuck with the “Download the Tesla One App” message at [192.168.92.1](http://192.168.92.1), stop wasting time. Download the *Tesla One* app, select “External Partner,” enter your Wall Connector serial manually, and use Setup Mode (blinking green) to reconfigure your unit.

\--

Alright Reddit — if you’re trying to reconfigure your Gen 3 Tesla Wall Connector (like resetting it or changing the breaker size), and all you’re getting is the “Tesla One App – Partner Access Only” screen at [`http://192.168.92.1`](http://192.168.92.1), here’s what actually worked for me after way too much trial and error. Tesla has changed how commissioning works, and most of the info online is now outdated.

# What You’ll Need:

* Tesla One App (not the regular Tesla app)
* Wall Connector serial number (usually on the back of the unit, behind the cover)
* A Tesla account (yes, even if you don’t own a Tesla)
* Your Wi-Fi password
* A little patience

# Steps to Reset or Recommission:

1. Download the **Tesla One App**
2. Choose **External Partner** when prompted
3. Log in or create a Tesla account
4. Tap: *Installs → Continue → Go to Home*
5. Tap **Begin Install**
6. Choose **Enter Connector Info Manually**
7. Type in your unit’s serial number
8. Put your Wall Connector into setup mode by holding the charging handle button for \~6 seconds until the LED blinks green
9. Tap **Join** when prompted
10. Follow the rest of the prompts:

* Set country
* Adjust breaker size (e.g., 50A sets output to 40A)
* Connect to Wi-Fi

# Quick Note:

I’m not an electrician — just a guy trying not to burn down the garage. My setup was wired to code for a 60A breaker, pulling 48A no problem. But during the county inspection, the inspector flagged it and made us swap to a 50A breaker due to some old local rule about cable length and attic heat.",2283,True,1748551103.0,2025-05-29 22:38:23,31,18,Temporary_Spinach_74,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kylja5/psa_cant_adjust_your_tesla_wall_connector/,True,0.85,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

But it never happened. For three hours straight, it negotiated its way through city streets, highways, and narrow roads in the most shockingly natural and peaceful way possible. It was so good that I actually found myself kind of bored with the experience. 

I never considered myself a Tesla hater, but after years of hearing ""FSD will be solved this year"", I have to admit that my skepticism was at an all time high. but after this, I genuinely have to reorganize my decision making with regards to future car purchases because I don't see how it's possible to buy anything else.

comment,1kyld3i,1kyld3i,,"1. If you have a 2007 Prius only getting 35mpg something is wrong. You should be well over 40mpg.  
  
2. L2 will be more efficient than L1 by a few percentage points.  
  
3. Do not use any stated range numbers for EVs they all tend to be over estimates. Remember, the battery will also degrade significantly over time.   
  
ICE EPA figures are pretty accurate nowadays...EV stuff isn't. However, the 32 miles that our Chrysler and BMW were supposed to get was pretty accurate.   
  
4. We've had hybrids (Prius 2005), PHEVs (Chrysler Pacifica and BMW x5), and an EV (Y AWD LR) - For long trips the PHEV is the way to go. Even with Tesla charging stations you're going to add signficant time to your trip and there's no guarantee that the charging station is going to have services nearby...and if they do whether they'll be open.

Of the PHEVs we've driven the Hyunda Santa Fe was pretty nice. The Mazdas were a little rough...especially when the battery was run out. I think they need a bit more time to get them right. The Toyota Rav 4 and Lexus were both really nice. The Lexus TX was the nicest of all...including our BMW x5 45e.

Why do we own a Y...well, we needed a car and at the end of '24 Tesla was offering discounts, rebates, 0% financing, etc. that brought the effective  cost of the car down to around $30k. At that price there really wasn't anything that competes.

This is not surprising given the specific vehicles you compared. You're looking at larger PHEVs which also are using inefficient parallel hybrid setup (as opposed to much more efficient power-split of Prius/Rav4 which I don't believe has been put in any larger PHEVs yet). And comparing them to Model Y which is smaller and made by a company that really worked hard to get their efficiency/range numbers up (through aerodynamics, an advanced hvac system, and some goofery with EPA test cycles)",780,False,1748554058.0,2025-05-29 23:27:38,2,0,iamtherussianspy,electricvehicles,https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kyld3i/new_vehicle_purchase_check_my_gaskwh_math_please/muyhn8u/,True,,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,muyhn8u

I will say I drive it daily and you are likely to run into haters still so if that is any indication they are doing their best to drive down the price.

You also want to know which cameras. The original ones will not work with FSD, but if you buy FSD or get the HW3 computer the cameras should be upgraded as well.

It seems logical to burn the inventory at the end of the model year to preserve the value of the remaining vehicles.

The news of unconfigurable is probably overblown, and the stock should rebound to some degree before the week is over.

post,1kyrdrn,,Thinking of buying a used Tesla — need input from long-time owners,"I recently test drove a few Teslas and instantly fell in love. Like many others have said, it completely changes how you view driving.

As much as I’d love to get a brand-new model (especially after experiencing HW4), my current financial situation only allows me to consider something from around 2018–2022 — ideally a 2019 or 2020 model.

So I have a few questions for those of you who own older Teslas:
	1.	Do you regularly use FSD (Full Self-Driving), or is it not really up to par with HW4, making you take over more often?
	2.	How many miles do you have on your car?
	3.	Is the claim that Tesla batteries can last up to 500k miles actually holding up for anyone here?

I know jumping into this might seem impulsive, but the experience genuinely changed my perspective — and the money saved on gas and oil changes is very appealing.

Do you think it’s too early for me to switch now, or should I just wait until I can comfortably afford a new model in 1–2 years?

Appreciate any honest input from experienced owners!",1021,False,1748566862.0,2025-05-30 03:01:02,0,6,L3THO,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1kyrdrn/thinking_of_buying_a_used_tesla_need_input_from/,True,0.5,2025,tesla,hot,False,False,0,

It felt like FSD was likely to get close in the next 12 months, but was considered almost without value in a used car, making it effectively free. 12 came out a couple months later and I felt validated LOL.

I work in auto and knew Tesla would either have to upgrade cars with insufficient hardware, repay the value, or make very attractive transfers to newer cars.

Once FSD unsupervised comes online, cost will skyrocket on both subscriptions and outright purchase.

comment,1kypy47,1kypy47,,"Nonsense

Faraday didn't have a decent formal mathematical education and yet Maxwell, one of the greatest physicists to ever live and a killer mathematician, publicly proclaimed that Faraday was a mathematician of the highest order.

Degrees matter and obviously some fields require certification, like medicine. You can't be legally considered an MD and can't call yourself one unless you're formally registered as one.

I'd argue though that conversely for philosophers and mathematicians, even today, it's almost completely irrelevant whether they are formally academically trained.

Srinivasa Ramanujan did not have a mathematical degree when he was discovered but saying he therefore wasn't a mathematician would prompt me to ask you to wash your mouth with soap.

For actual philosophers it's even worse and I'm willing to argue academic philosophy is a terrible way to make sure you'll never be an original relevant thinker. Pretty much like art school is definitely not the best way to become a great painter.

Engineers are halfway between doctors and philosophers because they build shit that must not break down while people walk on it or explode while people are flying it. 

Obviously legally designs that may collapse or explode would therefore probably require oversight by formally graduated engineers. Insurers won't like it otherwise (though maybe you can go without the title as long as the certifying party is formally graduated?).",2039,True,1748607418.0,2025-05-30 14:16:58,1,0,QuinQuix,elonmusk,https://reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/1kypy47/nvidia_ceo_jensen_huang_we_do_a_lot_of_business/mv1zvvz/,True,,2025,elon,hot,False,False,0,mv1zvvz

It's not about what you're mentally capable of, it's about what you're legally capable of.

Engineering (and medicine) is in this case other than mathematics or philosophy, because it has safety risks. You have to have the documented capabilities. In your view Andrew Tate is a philosopher cause he has a philosophical opinion.
